    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will run through a long-form exercise that allows us to put all this knowledge together. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be working with a corpus of fairy tales by the brothers Grimm, counting the frequency of terms used in each individual story and then creating a simple algorithm that measures similarity between stories using this information. In the future, such algorithms can be imported from modules created by others; but creating one is a useful way to reinforce the knowledge you obtained in the past lessons, practice working through a small project and avoid getting into the habit of 'outsourcing' algorithms without thinking about our needs and objectives, as well as what these algorithms are doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several modules for text analysis that provide advanced tools for text analysis. In this lesson, however, we will use the basic building blocks of the Python language to construct simple tools for term counting and similarity analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that there are multiple paths to the objectives we outline below. We do provide a 'solution' notebook with our approach towards this project as guidance if you get stuck, but if you find alternative solutions, it is more useful to think critically about your code and whether it achieves its goals than to try to make it conform to the sample solution.\n",

everything in amazement then she touched the\\nlight a little with her finger and her finger became quite golden\\nimmediately a great fear fell on her she shut the door violently and\\nran away her terror too would not quit her let her do what she might\\nand her heart beat continually and would not be still the gold too\\nstayed on her finger and would not go away let her rub it and wash it\\nnever so much\\n\\nit was not long before the virgin mary came back from her journey she\\ncalled the girl before her and asked to have the keys of heaven back\\nwhen the maiden gave her the bunch the virgin looked into her eyes and\\nsaid hast thou not opened the thirteenth door also no she\\nreplied then she laid her hand on the girls heart and felt how it\\nbeat and beat and saw right well that she had disobeyed her order and\\nhad opened the door then she said once again art thou certain that\\nthou hast not done it yes said the girl for the second time then\\nshe perceived the finger which had become golden from touching the fire\\nof heaven and saw well that the child had sinned and said for the\\nthird time hast thou not done it no said the girl for the third\\ntime then said the virgin mary thou hast not obeyed me and besides\\nthat thou hast lied thou art no longer worthy to be in heaven\\n\\nthen the girl fell into a deep sleep and when she awoke she lay on the\\nearth below and in the midst of a wilderness she wanted to cry out\\nbut she could bring forth no sound she sprang up and wanted to run\\naway but whithersoever she turned herself she was continually held\\nback by thick hedges of thorns through which she could not break in\\nthe desert in which she was imprisoned there stood an old hollow\\ntree and this had to be her dwellingplace into this she crept when\\nnight came and here she slept here too she found a shelter from\\nstorm and rain but it was a miserable life and bitterly did she weep\\nwhen she remembered how happy she had been in heaven and how the\\nangels had played with her roots and wild berries were her only food\\nand for these she sought as far as she could go in the autumn she\\npicked up the fallen nuts and leaves and carried them into the hole\\nthe nuts were her food in winter and when snow and ice came she crept\\namongst the leaves like a poor little animal that she might not freeze\\nbefore long her clothes were all torn and one bit of them after\\nanother fell off her as soon however as the sun shone warm again\\nshe went out and sat in front of the tree and her long hair covered\\nher on all sides like a mantle thus she sat year after year and felt\\nthe pain and the misery of the world one day when the trees were once\\nmore clothed in fresh green the king of the country was hunting in the\\nforest and followed a roe and as it had fled into the thicket which\\nshut in this part of the forest he got off his horse tore the bushes\\nasunder and cut himself a path with his sword when he had at last\\nforced his way through he saw a wonderfully beautiful maiden sitting\\nunder the tree and she sat there and was entirely covered with her\\ngolden hair down to her very feet he stood still and looked at her\\nfull of surprise then he spoke to her and said who art thou why art\\nthou sitting here in the wilderness but she gave no answer for she\\ncould not open her mouth the king continued wilt thou go with me to\\nmy castle then she just nodded her head a little the king took her\\nin his arms carried her to his horse and rode home with her and when\\nhe reached the royal castle he caused her to be dressed in beautiful\\ngarments and gave her all things in abundance although she could not\\nspeak she was still so beautiful and charming that he began to love\\nher with all his heart and it was not long before he married her\\n\\nafter a year or so had passed the queen brought a son into the world\\nthereupon the virgin mary appeared to her in the night when she lay in\\nher bed alone and said if thou wilt tell the truth and confess that\\nthou didst unlock the forbidden door i will open thy mouth and give\\nthee back thy speech but if thou perseverest in thy sin and deniest\\nobstinately i will take thy newborn child away with me then the\\nqueen was permitted to answer but she remained hard and said no i\\ndid not open the forbidden door and the virgin mary took the newborn\\nchild from her arms and vanished with it next morning when the child\\nwas not to be found it was whispered among the people that the queen\\nwas a maneater and had killed her own child she heard all this and\\ncould say nothing to the contrary but the king would not believe it\\nfor he loved her so much\\n\\nwhen a year had gone by the queen again bore a son and in the night\\nthe virgin mary again came to her and said if thou wilt confess that\\nthou openedst the forbidden door i will give thee thy child back and\\nuntie thy tongue but if you continuest in sin and deniest it i will\\ntake away with me this new child also then the queen again said no\\ni did not open the forbidden door and the virgin took the child out\\nof her arms and away with her to heaven next morning when this child\\nalso had disappeared the people declared quite loudly that the queen\\nhad devoured it and the kings councillors demanded that she should be\\nbrought to justice the king however loved her so dearly that he\\nwould not believe it and commanded the councillors under pain of death\\nnot to say any more about it\\n\\nthe following year the queen gave birth to a beautiful little daughter\\nand for the third time the virgin mary appeared to her in the night and\\nsaid follow me she took the queen by the hand and led her to\\nheaven and showed her there her two eldest children who smiled at\\nher and were playing with the ball of the world when the queen\\nrejoiced thereat the virgin mary said is thy heart not yet softened\\nif thou wilt own that thou openedst the forbidden door i will give\\nthee back thy two little sons but for the third time the queen\\nanswered no i did not open the forbidden door then the virgin let\\nher sink down to earth once more and took from her likewise her third\\nchild\\n\\nnext morning when the loss was reported abroad all the people cried\\nloudly the queen is a maneater she must be judged and the king\\nwas no longer able to restrain his councillors thereupon a trial was\\nheld and as she could not answer and defend herself she was\\ncondemned to be burnt alive the wood was got together and when she\\nwas fast bound to the stake and the fire began to burn round about\\nher the hard ice of pride melted her heart was moved by repentance\\nand she thought if i could but confess before my death that i opened\\nthe door then her voice came back to her and she cried out loudly\\nyes mary i did it and straightway rain fell from the sky and\\nextinguished the flames of fire and a light broke forth above her and\\nthe virgin mary descended with the two little sons by her side and the\\nnewborn daughter in her arms she spoke kindly to her and said he\\nwho repents his sin and acknowledges it is forgiven then she gave\\nher the three children untied her tongue and granted her happiness\\nfor her whole life',\n",
       " 'a certain father had two sons the elder of whom was smart and\\nsensible and could do everything but the younger was stupid and could\\nneither learn nor understand anything and when people saw him they\\nsaid theres a fellow who will give his father some trouble when\\nanything had to be done it was always the elder who was forced to do\\nit but if his father bade him fetch anything when it was late or in\\nthe nighttime and the way led through the churchyard or any other\\ndismal place he answered oh no father ill not go there it makes\\nme shudder for he was afraid or when stories were told by the fire\\nat night which made the flesh creep the listeners sometimes said oh\\nit makes us shudder the younger sat in a corner and listened with the\\nrest of them and could not imagine what they could mean they are\\nalways saying it makes me shudder it makes me shudder it does not\\nmake me shudder thought he that too must be an art of which i\\nunderstand nothing\\n\\nnow it came to pass that his father said to him one day hearken to me\\nthou fellow in the corner there thou art growing tall and strong and\\nthou too must learn something by which thou canst earn thy living look\\nhow thy brother works but thou dost not even earn thy salt well\\nfather he replied i am quite willing to learn something—indeed if\\nit could but be managed i should like to learn how to shudder i dont\\nunderstand that at all yet the elder brother smiled when he heard\\nthat and thought to himself good god what a blockhead that brother\\nof mine is he will never be good for anything as long as he lives he\\nwho wants to be a sickle must bend himself betimes\\n\\nthe father sighed and answered him thou shalt soon learn what it is\\nto shudder but thou wilt not earn thy bread by that\\n\\nsoon after this the sexton came to the house on a visit and the father\\nbewailed his trouble and told him how his younger son was so backward\\nin every respect that he knew nothing and learnt nothing just think\\nsaid he when i asked him how he was going to earn his bread he\\nactually wanted to learn to shudder if that be all replied the\\nsexton he can learn that with me send him to me and i will soon\\npolish him the father was glad to do it for he thought it will\\ntrain the boy a little the sexton therefore took him into his house\\nand he had to ring the bell after a day or two the sexton awoke him\\nat midnight and bade him arise and go up into the church tower and\\nring the bell thou shalt soon learn what shuddering is thought he\\nand secretly went there before him and when the boy was at the top of\\nthe tower and turned round and was just going to take hold of the bell\\nrope he saw a white figure standing on the stairs opposite the\\nsounding hole who is there cried he but the figure made no reply\\nand did not move or stir give an answer cried the boy or take thy\\nself off thou hast no business here at night\\n\\nthe sexton however remained standing motionless that the boy might\\nthink he was a ghost the boy cried a second time what do you want\\nhere—speak if thou art an honest fellow or i will throw thee down the\\nsteps the sexton thought he cant intend to be as bad as his\\nwords uttered no sound and stood as if he were made of stone then\\nthe boy called to him for the third time and as that was also to no\\npurpose he ran against him and pushed the ghost down the stairs so\\nthat it fell down ten steps and remained lying there in a corner\\nthereupon he rang the bell went home and without saying a word went\\nto bed and fell asleep the sextons wife waited a long time for her\\nhusband but he did not come back at length she became uneasy and\\nwakened the boy and asked dost thou not know where my husband is he\\nclimbed up the tower before thou didst no i dont know replied\\nthe boy but some one was standing by the sounding hole on the other\\nside of the steps and as he would neither give an answer nor go away\\ni took him for a scoundrel and threw him downstairs just go there and\\nyou will see if it was he i should be sorry if it were the woman ran\\naway and found her husband who was lying moaning in the corner and\\nhad broken his leg\\n\\nshe carried him down and then with loud screams she hastened to the\\nboys father your boy cried she has been the cause of a great\\nmisfortune he has thrown my husband down the steps and made him break\\nhis leg take the goodfornothing fellow away from our house the\\nfather was terrified and ran thither and scolded the boy what wicked\\ntricks are these said he the devil must have put this into thy\\nhead father he replied do listen to me i am quite innocent he\\nwas standing there by night like one who is intending to do some evil\\ni did not know who it was and i entreated him three times either to\\nspeak or to go away ah said the father i have nothing but\\nunhappiness with you go out of my sight i will see thee no more\\n\\nyes father right willingly wait only until it is day then will i\\ngo forth and learn how to shudder and then i shall at any rate\\nunderstand one art which will support me learn what thou wilt\\nspake the father it is all the same to me here are fifty thalers for\\nthee take these and go into the wide world and tell no one from\\nwhence thou comest and who is thy father for i have reason to be\\nashamed of thee yes father it shall be as you will if you desire\\nnothing more than that i can easily keep it in mind\\n\\nwhen day dawned therefore the boy put his fifty thalers into his\\npocket and went forth on the great highway and continually said to\\nhimself if i could but shudder if i could but shudder then a man\\napproached who heard this conversation which the youth was holding with\\nhimself and when they had walked a little farther to where they could\\nsee the gallows the man said to him look there is the tree where\\nseven men have married the ropemakers daughter and are now learning\\nhow to fly sit down below it and wait till night comes and you will\\nsoon learn how to shudder if that is all that is wanted answered\\nthe youth it is easily done but if i learn how to shudder as fast as\\nthat thou shalt have my fifty thalers just come back to me early in\\nthe morning then the youth went to the gallows sat down below it\\nand waited till evening came and as he was cold he lighted himself a\\nfire but at midnight the wind blew so sharply that in spite of his\\nfire he could not get warm and as the wind knocked the hanged men\\nagainst each other and they moved backwards and forwards he thought\\nto himself thou shiverest below by the fire but how those up above\\nmust freeze and suffer and as he felt pity for them he raised the\\nladder and climbed up unbound one of them after the other and\\nbrought down all seven then he stirred the fire blew it and set them\\nall round it to warm themselves but they sat there and did not stir\\nand the fire caught their clothes so he said take care or i will\\nhang you up again the dead men however did not hear but were quite\\nsilent and let their rags go on burning on this he grew angry and\\nsaid if you will not take care i cannot help you i will not be\\nburnt with you and he hung them up again each in his turn then he\\nsat down by his fire and fell asleep and the next morning the man came\\nto him and wanted to have the fifty thalers and said well dost thou\\nknow how to shudder no answered he how was i to get to know\\nthose fellows up there did not open their mouths and were so stupid\\nthat they let the few old rags which they had on their bodies get\\nburnt then the man saw that he would not get the fifty thalers that\\nday and went away saying one of this kind has never come my way\\nbefore\\n\\nthe youth likewise went his way and once more began to mutter to\\nhimself ah if i could but shudder ah if i could but shudder a\\nwaggoner who was striding behind him heard that and asked who are\\nyou i dont know answered the youth then the waggoner asked\\nfrom whence comest thou i know not who is thy father that i\\nmay not tell thee what is it that thou art always muttering between\\nthy teeth ah replied the youth i do so wish i could shudder but\\nno one can teach me how to do it give up thy foolish chatter said\\nthe waggoner come go with me i will see about a place for thee\\nthe youth went with the waggoner and in the evening they arrived at an\\ninn where they wished to pass the night then at the entrance of the\\nroom the youth again said quite loudly if i could but shudder if i\\ncould but shudder the host who heard this laughed and said if that\\nis your desire there ought to be a good opportunity for you here\\nah be silent said the hostess so many inquisitive persons have\\nalready lost their lives it would be a pity and a shame if such\\nbeautiful eyes as these should never see the daylight again\\n\\nbut the youth said however difficult it may be i will learn it and\\nfor this purpose indeed have i journeyed forth he let the host have\\nno rest until the latter told him that not far from thence stood a\\nhaunted castle where any one could very easily learn what shuddering\\nwas if he would but watch in it for three nights the king had\\npromised that he who would venture should have his daughter to wife\\nand she was the most beautiful maiden the sun shone on great treasures\\nlikewise lay in the castle which were guarded by evil spirits and\\nthese treasures would then be freed and would make a poor man rich\\nenough already many men had gone into the castle but as yet none had\\ncome out again then the youth went next morning to the king and said\\nif he were allowed he would watch three nights in the haunted castle\\nthe king looked at him and as the youth pleased him he said thou\\nmayest ask for three things to take into the castle with thee but they\\nmust be things without life then he answered then i ask for a fire\\na turning lathe and a cuttingboard with the knife the king had\\nthese things carried into the castle for him during the day when night\\nwas drawing near the youth went up and made himself a bright fire in\\none of the rooms placed the cuttingboard and knife beside it and\\nseated himself by the turninglathe ah if i could but shudder said\\nhe but i shall not learn it here either towards midnight he was\\nabout to poke his fire and as he was blowing it something cried\\nsuddenly from one corner au miau how cold we are you\\nsimpletons cried he what are you crying about if you are cold\\ncome and take a seat by the fire and warm yourselves and when he had\\nsaid that two great black cats came with one tremendous leap and sat\\ndown on each side of him and looked savagely at him with their fiery\\neyes after a short time when they had warmed themselves they said\\ncomrade shall we have a game at cards why not he replied but\\njust show me your paws then they stretched out their claws oh\\nsaid he what long nails you have wait i must first cut them for\\nyou thereupon he seized them by the throats put them on the\\ncuttingboard and screwed their feet fast i have looked at your\\nfingers said he and my fancy for cardplaying has gone and he\\nstruck them dead and threw them out into the water but when he had\\nmade away with these two and was about to sit down again by his fire\\nout from every hole and corner came black cats and black dogs with\\nredhot chains and more and more of them came until he could no longer\\nstir and they yelled horribly and got on his fire pulled it to\\npieces and tried to put it out he watched them for a while quietly\\nbut at last when they were going too far he seized his cuttingknife\\nand cried away with ye vermin and began to cut them down part of\\nthem ran away the others he killed and threw out into the fishpond\\nwhen he came back he fanned the embers of his fire again and warmed\\nhimself and as he thus sat his eyes would keep open no longer and he\\nfelt a desire to sleep then he looked round and saw a great bed in the\\ncorner that is the very thing for me said he and got into it when\\nhe was just going to shut his eyes however the bed began to move of\\nits own accord and went over the whole of the castle thats right\\nsaid he but go faster then the bed rolled on as if six horses were\\nharnessed to it up and down over thresholds and steps but suddenly\\nhop hop it turned over upside down and lay on him like a mountain\\nbut he threw quilts and pillows up in the air got out and said now\\nany one who likes may drive and lay down by his fire and slept till\\nit was day in the morning the king came and when he saw him lying\\nthere on the ground he thought the evil spirits had killed him and he\\nwas dead then said he after all it is a pity—he is a handsome man\\nthe youth heard it got up and said it has not come to that yet\\nthen the king was astonished but very glad and asked how he had\\nfared very well indeed answered he one night is past the two\\nothers will get over likewise then he went to the innkeeper who\\nopened his eyes very wide and said i never expected to see thee\\nalive again hast thou learnt how to shudder yet no said he it\\nis all in vain if some one would but tell me\\n\\nthe second night he again went up into the old castle sat down by the\\nfire and once more began his old song if i could but shudder when\\nmidnight came an uproar and noise of tumbling about was heard at\\nfirst it was low but it grew louder and louder then it was quiet for\\nawhile and at length with a loud scream half a man came down the\\nchimney and fell before him hollo cried he another half belongs\\nto this this is too little then the uproar began again there was a\\nroaring and howling and the other half fell down likewise wait\\nsaid he i will just blow up the fire a little for thee when he had\\ndone that and looked round again the two pieces were joined together\\nand a frightful man was sitting in his place that is no part of our\\nbargain said the youth the bench is mine the man wanted to push\\nhim away the youth however would not allow that but thrust him off\\nwith all his strength and seated himself again in his own place then\\nstill more men fell down one after the other they brought nine dead\\nmens legs and two skulls and set them up and played at ninepins with\\nthem the youth also wanted to play and said hark you can i join\\nyou yes if thou hast any money money enough replied he but\\nyour balls are not quite round then he took the skulls and put them\\nin the lathe and turned them till they were round there now they\\nwill roll better said he hurrah now it goes merrily he played\\nwith them and lost some of his money but when it struck twelve\\neverything vanished from his sight he lay down and quietly fell\\nasleep next morning the king came to inquire after him how has it\\nfared with you this time asked he i have been playing at\\nninepins he answered and have lost a couple of farthings hast\\nthou not shuddered then eh what said he i have made merry if i\\ndid but know what it was to shudder\\n\\nthe third night he sat down again on his bench and said quite sadly\\nif i could but shudder when it grew late six tall men came in and\\nbrought a coffin then said he ha ha that is certainly my little\\ncousin who died only a few days ago and he beckoned with his finger\\nand cried come little cousin come they placed the coffin on the\\nground but he went to it and took the lid off and a dead man lay\\ntherein he felt his face but it was cold as ice stop said he i\\nwill warm thee a little and went to the fire and warmed his hand and\\nlaid it on the dead mans face but he remained cold then he took him\\nout and sat down by the fire and laid him on his breast and rubbed his\\narms that the blood might circulate again as this also did no good he\\nthought to himself when two people lie in bed together they warm each\\nother and carried him to the bed covered him over and lay down by\\nhim after a short time the dead man became warm too and began to\\nmove then said the youth see little cousin have i not warmed\\nthee the dead man however got up and cried now will i strangle\\nthee\\n\\nwhat said he is that the way thou thankest me thou shalt at once\\ngo into thy coffin again and he took him up threw him into it and\\nshut the lid then came the six men and carried him away again i\\ncannot manage to shudder said he i shall never learn it here as\\nlong as i live\\n\\nthen a man entered who was taller than all others and looked terrible\\nhe was old however and had a long white beard thou wretch cried\\nhe thou shalt soon learn what it is to shudder for thou shalt die\\nnot so fast replied the youth if i am to die i shall have to have\\na say in it i will soon seize thee said the fiend softly\\nsoftly do not talk so big i am as strong as thou art and perhaps\\neven stronger we shall see said the old man if thou art\\nstronger i will let thee go—come we will try then he led him by\\ndark passages to a smiths forge took an axe and with one blow struck\\nan anvil into the ground i can do better than that said the youth\\nand went to the other anvil the old man placed himself near and wanted\\nto look on and his white beard hung down then the youth seized the\\naxe split the anvil with one blow and struck the old mans beard in\\nwith it now i have thee said the youth now it is thou who will\\nhave to die then he seized an iron bar and beat the old man till he\\nmoaned and entreated him to stop and he would give him great riches\\nthe youth drew out the axe and let him go the old man led him back\\ninto the castle and in a cellar showed him three chests full of gold\\nof these said he one part is for the poor the other for the king\\nthe third is thine in the meantime it struck twelve and the spirit\\ndisappeared the youth therefore was left in darkness i shall still\\nbe able to find my way out said he and felt about found the way\\ninto the room and slept there by his fire next morning the king came\\nand said now thou must have learnt what shuddering is no he\\nanswered what can it be my dead cousin was here and a bearded man\\ncame and showed me a great deal of money down below but no one told me\\nwhat it was to shudder then said the king thou hast delivered\\nthe castle and shalt marry my daughter that is all very well said\\nhe but still i do not know what it is to shudder\\n\\nthen the gold was brought up and the wedding celebrated but howsoever\\nmuch the young king loved his wife and however happy he was he still\\nsaid always if i could but shudder—if i could but shudder and at\\nlast she was angry at this her waitingmaid said i will find a cure\\nfor him he shall soon learn what it is to shudder she went out to\\nthe stream which flowed through the garden and had a whole bucketful\\nof gudgeons brought to her at night when the young king was sleeping\\nhis wife was to draw the clothes off him and empty the bucketful of\\ncold water with the gudgeons in it over him so that the little fishes\\nwould sprawl about him when this was done he woke up and cried oh\\nwhat makes me shudder so—what makes me shudder so dear wife ah now\\ni know what it is to shudder',\n",
       " 'there was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids and\\nloved them with all the love of a mother for her children one day she\\nwanted to go into the forest and fetch some

took himself off laid himself down\\nunder a tree in the green meadow outside and began to sleep soon\\nafterwards the old goat came home again from the forest ah what a\\nsight she saw there the

said no more but laid his head on his pillow and died\\n\\nwhen the old king had been carried to his grave faithful john told the\\nyoung king all that he had promised his father on his deathbed and\\nsaid this will i assuredly perform and will be faithful to thee as i\\nhave been faithful to him even if it should cost me my life when the\\nmourning was over faithful john said to him it is now time that thou\\nshouldst see thine inheritance i will show thee thy fathers palace\\nthen he took him about everywhere up and down and let him see all the\\nriches and the magnificent apartments only there was one room which\\nhe did not open that in which hung the dangerous picture the picture\\nwas however so placed that when the door was opened you looked\\nstraight on it and it was so admirably painted that it seemed to\\nbreathe and live and there was nothing more charming or more beautiful\\nin the whole world the young king however plainly remarked that\\nfaithful john always walked past this one door and said why dost\\nthou never open this one for me there is something within it he\\nreplied which would terrify thee but the king answered i have\\nseen all the palace and i will know what is in this room also and he\\nwent and tried to break open the door by force then faithful john held\\nhim back and said i promised thy father before his death that thou\\nshouldst not see that which is in this chamber it might bring the\\ngreatest misfortune on thee and on me ah no replied the young\\nking if i do not go in it will be my certain destruction i should\\nhave no rest day or night until i had seen it with my own eyes i shall\\nnot leave the place now until thou hast unlocked the door\\n\\nthen faithful john saw that there was no help for it now and with a\\nheavy heart and many sighs sought out the key from the great bunch\\nwhen he had opened the door he went in first and thought by standing\\nbefore him he could hide the portrait so that the king should not see\\nit in front of him but what availed that the king stood on tiptoe\\nand saw it over his shoulder and when he saw the portrait of the\\nmaiden which was so magnificent and shone with gold and precious\\nstones he fell fainting to the ground faithful john took him up\\ncarried him to his bed and sorrowfully thought the misfortune has\\nbefallen us lord god what will be the end of it then he\\nstrengthened him with wine until he came to himself again the first\\nwords the king said were ah the beautiful portrait whose it it\\nthat is the princess of the golden dwelling answered faithful john\\nthen the king continued my love for her is so great that if all the\\nleaves on all the trees were tongues they could not declare it i will\\ngive my life to win her thou art my most faithful john thou must help\\nme\\n\\nthe faithful servant considered within himself for a long time how to\\nset about the matter for it was difficult even to obtain a sight of\\nthe kings daughter at length he thought of a way and said to the\\nking everything which she has about her is of gold—tables chairs\\ndishes glasses bowls and household furniture among thy treasures\\nare five tons of gold let one of the goldsmiths of the kingdom work\\nthese up into all manner of vessels and utensils into all kinds of\\nbirds wild beasts and strange animals such as may please her and we\\nwill go there with them and try our luck\\n\\nthe king ordered all the goldsmiths to be brought to him and they had\\nto work night and day until at last the most splendid things were\\nprepared when everything was stowed on board a ship faithful john put\\non the dress of a merchant and the king was forced to do the same in\\norder to make himself quite unrecognizable then they sailed across the\\nsea and sailed on until they came to the town wherein dwelt the\\nprincess of the golden dwelling\\n\\nfaithful john bade the king stay behind on the ship and wait for him\\nperhaps i shall bring the princess with me said he therefore see\\nthat everything is in order have the golden vessels set out and the\\nwhole ship decorated then he gathered together in his apron all kinds\\nof gold things went on shore and walked straight to the royal palace\\nwhen he entered the courtyard of the palace a beautiful girl was\\nstanding there by the well with two golden buckets in her hand drawing\\nwater with them and when she was just turning round to carry away the\\nsparkling water she saw the stranger and asked who he was so he\\nanswered i am a merchant and opened his apron and let her look in\\nthen she cried oh what beautiful gold things and put her pails\\ndown and looked at the golden wares one after the other then said the\\ngirl the princess must see these she has such great pleasure in\\ngolden things that she will buy all you have she took him by the\\nhand and led him upstairs for she was the waitingmaid when the\\nkings daughter saw the wares she was quite delighted and said they\\nare so beautifully worked that i will buy them all of thee but\\nfaithful john said i am only the servant of a rich merchant the\\nthings i have here are not to be compared with those my master has in\\nhis ship they are the most beautiful and valuable things that have\\never been made in gold she wanted to have everything brought to her\\nthere but he said there are so many of them that it would take a\\ngreat many days to do that and so many rooms would be required to\\nexhibit them that your house is not big enough then her curiosity\\nand longing were still more excited until at last she said conduct\\nme to the ship i will go there myself and behold the treasures of\\nthine master\\n\\non this faithful john was quite delighted and led her to the ship and\\nwhen the king saw her he perceived that her beauty was even greater\\nthan the picture had represented it to be and thought no other than\\nthat his heart would burst in twain then she got into the ship and\\nthe king led her within faithful john however remained behind with\\nthe pilot and ordered the ship to be pushed off saying set all\\nsail till it fly like a bird in air within however the king showed\\nher the golden vessels every one of them also the wild beasts and\\nstrange animals many hours went by whilst she was seeing everything\\nand in her delight she did not observe that the ship was sailing away\\nafter she had looked at the last she thanked the merchant and wanted\\nto go home but when she came to the side of the ship she saw that it\\nwas on the deep sea far from land and hurrying onwards with all sail\\nset ah cried she in her alarm i am betrayed i am carried away\\nand have fallen into the power of a merchant—i would die rather the\\nking however seized her hand and said i am not a merchant i am a\\nking and of no meaner origin than thou art and if i have carried thee\\naway with subtlety that has come to pass because of my exceeding great\\nlove for thee the first time that i looked on thy portrait i fell\\nfainting to the ground when the princess of the golden dwelling heard\\nthat she was comforted and her heart was inclined unto him so that\\nshe willingly consented to be his wife\\n\\nit so happened however while they were sailing onwards over the deep\\nsea that faithful john who was sitting on the fore part of the\\nvessel making music saw three ravens in the air which came flying\\ntowards them on this he stopped playing and listened to what they were\\nsaying to each other for that he well understood one cried oh\\nthere he is carrying home the princess of the golden dwelling yes\\nreplied the second but he has not got her yet said the third but\\nhe has got her she is sitting beside him in the ship then the first\\nbegan again and cried what good will that do him when they reach\\nland a chestnut horse will leap forward to meet him and the prince\\nwill want to mount it but if he does that it will run away with him\\nand rise up into the air with him and he will never see his maiden\\nmore spake the second but is there no escape\\n\\noh yes if any one else gets on it swiftly and takes out the pistol\\nwhich must be in its holster and shoots the horse dead with it the\\nyoung king is saved but who knows that and whosoever does know it\\nand tells it to him will be turned to stone from the toe to the knee\\nthen said the second i know more than that even if the horse be\\nkilled the young king will still not keep his bride when they go into\\nthe castle together a wrought bridal garment will be lying there in a\\ndish and looking as if it were woven of gold and silver it is\\nhowever nothing but sulphur and pitch and if he put it on it will\\nburn him to the very bone and marrow said the third is there no\\nescape at all\\n\\noh yes replied the second if any one with gloves on seizes the\\ngarment and throws it into the fire and burns it the young king will\\nbe saved but what avails that whosoever knows it and tells it to\\nhim half his body will become stone from the knee to the heart\\n\\nthen said the third i know still more even if the bridal garment be\\nburnt the young king will still not have his bride after the wedding\\nwhen the dancing begins and the young queen is dancing she will\\nsuddenly turn pale and fall down as if dead and if some one does not\\nlift her up and draw three drops of blood from her right breast and\\nspit them out again she will die but if any one who knows that were\\nto declare it he would become stone from the crown of his head to the\\nsole of his foot when the ravens had spoken of this together they\\nflew onwards and faithful john had well understood everything but\\nfrom that time forth he became quiet and sad for if he concealed what\\nhe had heard from his master the latter would be unfortunate and if\\nhe discovered it to him he himself must sacrifice his life at length\\nhowever he said to himself i will save my master even if it bring\\ndestruction on myself\\n\\nwhen therefore they came to shore all happened as had been foretold by\\nthe ravens and a magnificent chestnut horse sprang forward good\\nsaid the king he shall carry me to my palace and was about to mount\\nit when faithful john got before him jumped quickly on it drew the\\npistol out of the holster and shot the horse then the other\\nattendants of the king who after all were not very fond of faithful\\njohn cried how shameful to kill the beautiful animal that was to\\nhave carried the king to his palace but the king said hold your\\npeace and leave him alone he is my most faithful john who knows what\\nmay be the good of that they went into the palace and in the hall\\nthere stood a dish and therein lay the bridal garment looking no\\notherwise than as if it were made of gold and silver the young king\\nwent towards it and was about to take hold of it but faithful john\\npushed him away seized it with gloves on carried it quickly to the\\nfire and burnt it the other attendants again began to murmur and\\nsaid behold now he is even burning the kings bridal garment but\\nthe young king said who knows what good he may have done leave him\\nalone he is my most faithful john\\n\\nand now the wedding was solemnized the dance began and the bride also\\ntook part in it then faithful john was watchful and looked into her\\nface and suddenly she turned pale and fell to the ground as if she\\nwere dead on this he ran hastily to her lifted her up and bore her\\ninto a chamber—then he laid her down and knelt and sucked the three\\ndrops of blood from her right breast and spat them out immediately\\nshe breathed again and recovered herself but the young king had seen\\nthis and being ignorant why faithful john had done it was angry and\\ncried throw him into a dungeon next morning faithful john was\\ncondemned and led to the gallows and when he stood on high and was\\nabout to be executed he said every one who has to die is permitted\\nbefore his end to make one last speech may i too claim the right\\nyes answered the king it shall be granted unto thee then said\\nfaithful john i am unjustly condemned and have always been true to\\nthee and he related how he had hearkened to the conversation of the\\nravens when on the sea and how he had been obliged to do all these\\nthings in order to save his master then cried the king oh my most\\nfaithful john pardon pardon—bring him down but as faithful john\\nspoke the last word he had fallen down lifeless and become a stone\\n\\nthereupon the king and the queen suffered great anguish and the king\\nsaid ah how ill i have requited great fidelity and ordered the\\nstone figure to be taken up and placed in his bedroom beside his bed\\nand as often as he looked on it he wept and said ah if i could bring\\nthee to life again my most faithful john some time passed and the\\nqueen bore twins two sons who grew fast and were her delight once\\nwhen the queen was at church and the two children were sitting playing\\nbeside their father the latter full of grief again looked at the stone\\nfigure sighed and said ah if i could but bring thee to life again\\nmy most faithful john then the stone began to speak and said thou\\ncanst bring me to life again if thou wilt use for that purpose what is\\ndearest to thee then cried the king i will give everything i have\\nin the world for thee the stone continued if thou wilt will cut off\\nthe heads of thy two children with thine own hand and sprinkle me with\\ntheir blood i shall be restored to life\\n\\nthe king was terrified when he heard that he himself must kill his\\ndearest children but he thought of faithful johns great fidelity and\\nhow he had died for him drew his sword and with his own hand cut off\\nthe childrens heads and when he had smeared the stone with their\\nblood life returned to it and faithful john stood once more safe and\\nhealthy before him he said to the king thy truth shall not go\\nunrewarded and took the heads of the children put them on again and\\nrubbed the wounds with their blood on which they became whole again\\nimmediately and jumped about and went on playing as if nothing had\\nhappened then the king was full of joy and when he saw the queen\\ncoming he hid faithful john and the two children in a great cupboard\\nwhen she entered he said to her hast thou been praying in the\\nchurch yes answered she but i have constantly been thinking of\\nfaithful john and what misfortune has befallen him through us then\\nsaid he dear wife we can give him his life again but it will cost\\nus our two little sons whom we must sacrifice the queen turned pale\\nand her heart was full of terror but she said we owe it to him for\\nhis great fidelity then the king was rejoiced that she thought as he\\nhad thought and went and opened the cupboard and brought forth\\nfaithful john and the children and said god be praised he is\\ndelivered and we have our little sons again also and told her how\\neverything had occurred then they dwelt together in much happiness\\nuntil their death',\n",

his pocket\\nand counted out the seven thalers always reckoning four and twenty\\ngroschen to a thaler the frogs however paid no attention to his\\nreckoning but still cried aik aik aik aik what cried the\\npeasant quite angry since you are determined to know better than i\\ncount it yourselves and threw all the money into the water to them\\nhe stood still and wanted to wait until they were done and had brought\\nhim his own again but the frogs maintained their opinion and cried\\ncontinually aik aik aik aik and besides that did not throw the\\nmoney out again he still waited a long while until evening came on and\\nhe was forced to go home then he abused the frogs and cried you\\nwatersplashers you thickheads you goggleeyes you have great\\nmouths and can screech till you hurt ones ears but you cannot count\\nseven thalers do you think im going to stand here till you get done\\nand with that he went away but the frogs still cried aik aik aik\\naik after him till he went home quite angry\\n\\nafter a while he bought another cow which he killed and he made the\\ncalculation that if he sold the meat well he might gain as much as the\\ntwo cows were worth and have the skin into the bargain when therefore\\nhe got to the town with the meat a great troop of dogs were gathered\\ntogether in front of the gate with a large greyhound at the head of\\nthem which jumped at the meat snuffed at it and barked wow wow\\nwow as there was no stopping him the peasant said to him yes yes\\ni know quite well that thou art saying wow wow wow because thou\\nwantest some of the meat but i should fare badly if i were to give it\\nto thee the dog however answered nothing but wow wow wilt thou\\npromise not to devour it all then and wilt thou go bail for thy\\ncompanions wow wow wow said the dog well if thou insistest on\\nit i will leave it for thee i know thee well and know who is thy\\nmaster but this i tell thee i must have my money in three days or\\nelse it will go ill with thee thou must just bring it out to me\\nthereupon he unloaded the meat and turned back again the dogs fell\\nupon it and loudly barked wow wow\\n\\nthe countryman who heard them from afar said to himself hark now\\nthey all want some but the big one is responsible to me for it\\n\\nwhen three days had passed the countryman thought tonight my money\\nwill be in my pocket and was quite delighted but no one would come\\nand pay it there is no trusting any one now said he and at last he\\nlost patience and went into the town to the butcher and demanded his\\nmoney the butcher thought it was a joke but the peasant said\\njesting apart i will have my money did not the great dog bring you\\nthe whole of the slaughtered cow three days ago then the butcher grew\\nangry snatched a broomstick and drove him out wait a while said\\nthe peasant there is still some justice in the world and went to\\nthe royal palace and begged for an audience he was led before the\\nking who sat there with his daughter and asked him what injury he had\\nsuffered alas said he the frogs and the dogs have taken from me\\nwhat is mine and the butcher has paid me for it with the stick and\\nhe related at full length all that had happened thereupon the kings\\ndaughter began to laugh heartily and the king said to him i cannot\\ngive you justice in this but you shall have my daughter to wife for\\nit—in her whole life she has never yet laughed as she has just done at\\nthee and i have promised her to him who could make her laugh thou\\nmayst thank god for thy good fortune\\n\\noh answered the peasant i will not have her i have a wife\\nalready and she is one too many for me when i go home it is just as\\nbad as if i had a wife standing in every corner then the king grew\\nangry and said thou art a boor ah lord king replied the\\npeasant what can you expect from an ox but beef stop answered\\nthe king thou shalt have another reward be off now but come back in\\nthree days and then thou shalt have five hundred counted out in full\\n\\nwhen the peasant went out by the gate the sentry said thou hast made\\nthe kings daughter laugh so thou wilt certainly receive something\\ngood yes that is what i think answered the peasant five hundred\\nare to be counted out to me hark thee said the soldier give me\\nsome of it what canst thou do with all that money as it is thou\\nsaid the peasant thou shalt have two hundred present thyself in\\nthree days time before the king and let it be paid to thee a jew\\nwho was standing by and had heard the conversation ran after the\\npeasant held him by the coat and said oh wonder what a luckchild\\nthou art i will change it for thee i will change it for thee into\\nsmall coins what dost thou want with the great thalers jew said\\nthe countryman three hundred canst thou still have give it to me at\\nonce in coin in three days from this thou wilt be paid for it by the\\nking the jew was delighted with the profit and brought the sum in\\nbad groschen three of which were worth two good ones after three days\\nhad passed according to the kings command the peasant went before\\nthe king pull his coat off said the latter and he shall have his\\nfive hundred ah said the peasant they no longer belong to me i\\npresented two hundred of them to the sentinel and three hundred the\\njew has changed for me so by right nothing at all belongs to me in\\nthe meantime the soldier and the jew entered and claimed what they had\\ngained from the peasant and they received the blows strictly counted\\nout the soldier bore it patiently and knew already how it tasted but\\nthe jew said sorrowfully alas alas are these the heavy thalers\\nthe king could not help laughing at the peasant and as all his anger\\nwas gone he said as thou hast already lost thy reward before it fell\\nto thy lot i will give thee something in the place of it go into my\\ntreasure chamber and get some money for thyself as much as thou wilt\\nthe peasant did not need to be told twice and stuffed into his big\\npockets whatsoever would go in afterwards he went to an inn and\\ncounted out his money the jew had crept after him and heard how he\\nmuttered to himself that rogue of a king has cheated me after all\\nwhy could he not have given me the money himself and then i should\\nhave known what i had how can i tell now if what i have had the luck\\nto put in my pockets is right or not good heavens said the jew to\\nhimself that man is speaking disrespectfully of our lord the king i\\nwill run and inform and then i shall get a reward and he will be\\npunished as well\\n\\nwhen the king heard of the peasants words he fell into a passion and\\ncommanded the jew to go and bring the offender to him the jew ran to\\nthe peasant you are to go at once to the lord king in the very\\nclothes you have on i know whats right better than that answered\\nthe peasant i shall have a new coat made first dost thou think that\\na man with so much money in his pocket is to go there in his ragged old\\ncoat the jew as he saw that the peasant would not stir without\\nanother coat and as he feared that if the kings anger cooled he\\nhimself would lose his reward and the peasant his punishment said i\\nwill out of pure friendship lend thee a coat for the short time what\\nwill people not do for love the peasant was contented with this put\\nthe jews coat on and went off with him\\n\\nthe king reproached the countryman because of the evil speaking of\\nwhich the jew had informed him ah said the peasant what a jew\\nsays is always false—no true word ever comes out of his mouth that\\nrascal there is capable of maintaining that i have his coat on\\n\\nwhat is that shrieked the jew is the coat not mine have i not\\nlent it to thee out of pure friendship in order that thou might appear\\nbefore the lord king when the king heard that he said the jew has\\nassuredly deceived one or the other of us either myself or the\\npeasant and again he ordered something to be counted out to him in\\nhard thalers the peasant however went home in the good coat with\\nthe good money in his pocket and said to himself this time i have\\nhit it',\n",
       " 'there was once a wonderful musician who went quite alone through a\\nforest and thought of all manner of things and when nothing was left\\nfor him to think about he said to himself time is beginning to pass\\nheavily with me here in the forest i will fetch hither a good\\ncompanion for myself then he took his fiddle from his back and\\nplayed so that it echoed through the trees it was not long before a\\nwolf came trotting through the thicket towards him ah here is a wolf\\ncoming i have no desire for him said the musician but the wolf came\\nnearer and said to him ah dear musician how beautifully thou dost\\nplay i should like to learn that too it is soon learnt the\\nmusician replied thou hast only to do all that i bid thee oh\\nmusician said the wolf i will obey thee as a scholar obeys his\\nmaster the musician bade him follow and when they had gone part of\\nthe way together they came to an old oaktree which was hollow inside\\nand cleft in the middle look said the musician if thou wilt learn\\nto fiddle put thy fore paws into this crevice the wolf obeyed but\\nthe musician quickly picked up a stone and with one blow wedged his two\\npaws so fast that he was forced to stay there like a prisoner stay\\nthere until i come back again said the musician and went his way\\n\\nafter a while he again said to himself time is beginning to pass\\nheavily with me here in the forest i will fetch hither another\\ncompanion and took his fiddle and again played in the forest it was\\nnot long before a fox came creeping through the trees towards him ah\\ntheres a fox coming said the musician i have no desire for him\\nthe fox came up to him and said oh dear musician how beautifully\\nthou dost play i should like to learn that too that is soon\\nlearnt said the

of the way they came to a footpath with high\\nbushes on both sides of it there the musician stood still and from\\none side bent a young hazelbush down to the ground and put his foot\\non the top of it then he bent down a young tree from the other side as\\nwell and said now little fox if thou wilt learn something give me\\nthy left front paw the fox obeyed and the musician fastened his paw\\nto the left bough little fox said he now reach me thy right paw\\nand he tied it to the right bough when he had examined whether they\\nwere firm enough he let go and the bushes sprang up again and

tree bit the cord in two and freed the fox who\\nwent with him to take revenge on the musician they found the tiedup\\nhare whom likewise they delivered and then they all sought the enemy\\ntogether\\n\\nthe musician had once more played his fiddle as he went on his way and\\nthis time he had been more fortunate the sound reached the ears of a\\npoor woodcutter who instantly whether he would or no gave up his\\nwork and came with his hatchet under his arm to listen to the music\\nat last comes the right companion said the musician for i was\\nseeking a human being and no

       " 'there were once on a time a king and a queen who lived happily together\\nand had twelve children but they were all boys then said the king to\\nhis wife if the thirteenth child which thou

be made which were already filled\\nwith shavings and in each lay the little pillow for the dead and he\\nhad them taken into a lockedup room and then he gave the queen the\\nkey of it and bade her not to speak of this to any one\\n\\nthe mother however now sat and lamented all day long until the\\nyoungest son who was always with her and whom she had named benjamin\\nfrom the bible said to her dear mother why art thou so sad\\n\\ndearest child she answered i may not tell thee but he let her\\nhave no rest until she went and unlocked the room and showed him the\\ntwelve coffins ready filled with shavings then she said my dearest\\nbenjamin thy father has had these coffins made for thee and for thy\\neleven brothers for if i bring a little girl into the world you are\\nall to be killed and buried in them and as she wept while she was\\nsaying this the son comforted her and said weep not dear mother we\\nwill save ourselves and go hence but she said go forth into the\\nforest with thy eleven brothers and let one sit constantly on the\\nhighest tree which can be found and keep watch looking towards the\\ntower here in the castle if i give birth to a little son i will put\\nup a white flag and then you may venture to come back but if i bear a\\ndaughter i will hoist a red flag and then fly hence as quickly as you\\nare able and may the good god protect you and every night i will rise\\nup and pray for you—in winter that you may be able to warm yourself at\\na fire and in summer that you may not faint away in the heat\\n\\nafter she had blessed her sons therefore they went forth into the\\nforest they each kept watch in turn and sat on the highest oak and\\nlooked towards the tower when eleven days had passed and the turn came\\nto benjamin he saw that a flag was being raised it was however not\\nthe white but the bloodred flag which announced that they were all to\\ndie when the brothers heard that they were very angry and said are\\nwe all to suffer death for the sake of a girl we swear that we will\\navenge ourselves—wheresoever we find a girl her red blood shall\\nflow\\n\\nthereupon they went deeper into the forest and in the midst of it\\nwhere it

keep\\nhouse we others will go out and get food then they went into the\\nforest and shot hares wild deer birds and pigeons and whatsoever\\nthere was to eat this they took to benjamin who had to

agreed that every maiden whom we meet\\nshall die because we have been obliged to leave our kingdom on account\\nof a girl then said she i will willingly die if by so doing i can\\ndeliver my twelve brothers\\n\\nno answered he thou shalt not die seat thyself beneath this tub\\nuntil our eleven brothers come and then i will soon come to an\\nagreement with them\\n\\nshe did so and when it was night the others came from hunting and\\ntheir dinner was ready and as they were sitting at table and eating\\nthey asked what news is there said benjamin dont you know\\nanything no they answered he continued you have been in the\\nforest and i have stayed at home and yet i know more than you do\\ntell us then they cried he answered but promise me that the first\\nmaiden who meets us shall not be killed yes they all cried she\\nshall have mercy only do tell us\\n\\nthen said he our sister is here and he lifted up the tub and the\\nkings daughter came forth in her royal garments with the golden star\\non her forehead and she was beautiful delicate and fair then they\\nwere all rejoiced and fell on her neck and kissed and loved her with\\nall their hearts\\n\\nnow she stayed at home with benjamin and helped him with the work the\\neleven went into the forest and caught game and deer and birds and\\nwoodpigeons that they might have food and the little sister and\\nbenjamin took care to make it ready for them she sought for the wood\\nfor cooking and herbs for vegetables and put the pans on the fire so\\nthat the dinner was always ready when the eleven came she likewise\\nkept order in the little house and put beautifully white clean\\ncoverings on the little beds and the brothers were always contented\\nand lived in great harmony with her\\n\\nonce on a time the two at home had prepared a beautiful entertainment\\nand when they were all together they sat down and ate and drank and\\nwere full of gladness there was however a little garden belonging to\\nthe bewitched house wherein stood twelve lily flowers which are\\nlikewise called students she wished to give her brothers pleasure and\\nplucked the twelve flowers and thought she would present each brother\\nwith one while at dinner but at the selfsame moment that she plucked\\nthe flowers the twelve brothers were changed into twelve ravens and\\nflew away over the forest and the house and garden vanished likewise\\nand now the poor maiden was alone in the wild forest and when she\\nlooked around an old woman was standing near her who said my child\\nwhat hast thou done why didst thou not leave the twelve white flowers\\ngrowing they were thy brothers who are now for evermore changed into\\nravens the maiden said weeping is there no way of delivering\\nthem\\n\\nno said the woman there is but one in the whole world and that is\\nso hard that thou wilt not deliver them by it for thou must be dumb\\nfor seven years and mayst not speak or laugh and if thou speakest one\\nsingle word and only an hour of the seven years is wanting all is in\\nvain and thy brothers will be killed by the one word\\n\\nthen said the maiden in her heart i know with certainty that i shall\\nset my brothers free and went and sought a high tree and seated\\nherself in it and span and neither spoke nor laughed now it so\\nhappened that a king was hunting in the forest who had a great\\ngreyhound which ran to the tree on which the maiden was sitting and\\nsprang about it whining and barking at her then the king came by and\\nsaw the beautiful kings daughter with the golden star on her brow and\\nwas so charmed with her beauty that he called to ask her if she would\\nbe his wife she made no answer but nodded a little with her head so\\nhe climbed up the tree himself carried her down placed her on his\\nhorse and bore her home then the wedding was solemnized with great\\nmagnificence and rejoicing but the bride neither spoke nor smiled\\nwhen they had lived happily together for a few years the kings\\nmother who was a wicked woman began to slander the young queen and\\nsaid to the king this is a common beggar girl whom thou hast brought\\nback with thee who knows what impious tricks she practises secretly\\neven if she be dumb and not able to speak she still might laugh for\\nonce but those who do not laugh have bad consciences at first the\\nking would not believe it but the old woman urged this so long and\\naccused her of so many evil things that at last the king let himself\\nbe persuaded and sentenced her to death\\n\\nand now a great fire was lighted in the courtyard in which she was to\\nbe burnt and the king stood above at the window and looked on with\\ntearful eyes because he still loved her so much and when she was\\nbound fast to the stake and the fire was licking at her clothes with\\nits red tongue the last instant of the seven years expired then a\\nwhirring sound was heard in the air and twelve ravens came flying\\ntowards the place and sank downwards and when they touched the earth\\nthey were her twelve brothers whom she had delivered they tore the\\nfire asunder extinguished the flames set their dear sister free and\\nkissed and embraced her and now as she dared to open her mouth and\\nspeak she told the king why she had been dumb and had never laughed\\nthe king rejoiced when he heard that she was innocent and they all\\nlived in great unity until their death the wicked stepmother was\\ntaken before the judge and put into a barrel filled with boiling oil\\nand venomous snakes and died an evil death',\n",

belonged to an\\nenchantress who had great power and was dreaded by all the world one\\nday the woman was standing by this window and looking down into the\\ngarden when she saw a bed which was planted with the most beautiful\\nrampion rapunzel and it looked so fresh and green that she longed\\nfor it and had the greatest desire to eat some this desire increased\\nevery day and as she knew that she could not get any of it she quite\\npined away and looked pale and miserable then her husband was\\nalarmed and asked what aileth thee dear wife ah she replied\\nif i cant get some of the rampion which is in the garden behind our\\nhouse to eat i shall die the man who loved her thought sooner\\nthan let thy wife die bring her some of the rampion thyself let it\\ncost thee what it will

of it and ate it with much relish she however liked it so\\nmuch—so very much that the next day she longed for it three times as\\nmuch as before if he was to have any rest her husband must once more\\ndescend into the garden in the gloom of evening therefore he let\\nhimself down again but when he had clambered down the wall he was\\nterribly afraid for he saw the enchantress standing before

she shall every day grow more\\nbeautiful the second said my gift is that gold pieces shall fall\\nout of her mouth every time she speaks the third said my gift is\\nthat a king shall come and take her to wife\\n\\nthe girl however did as the little men had bidden her swept away the\\nsnow behind the little house with the broom and what did she find but\\nreal ripe strawberries which came up quite darkred out of the snow\\nin her joy she hastily gathered her basket full thanked the little\\nmen shook hands with each of them and ran home to take her\\nstepmother what she had longed for so much when she went in and said\\ngoodevening a piece of gold at once fell from her mouth thereupon\\nshe related what had happened to her in the wood but with every word\\nshe spoke gold pieces fell from her mouth until very soon the whole\\nroom was covered with them now look at her arrogance cried the\\nstepsister to throw about gold in that way but she was secretly\\nenvious of it and wanted to go into the forest also to seek\\nstrawberries the mother said no my dear little daughter it is too\\ncold thou mightest die of cold however as her daughter let her have\\nno peace the mother at last yielded made her a magnificent dress of\\nfur which she was obliged to put on and gave her breadandbutter and\\ncake with her\\n\\nthe girl went into the forest and straight up to the little house the\\nthree little elves peeped out again but she did not greet them and\\nwithout looking round at them and without speaking to them she went\\nawkwardly into the room seated herself by the stove and began to eat\\nher breadandbutter and cake give us some of it cried the little\\nmen but she replied there is not enough for myself so how can i\\ngive it away to other people when she had done eating they said\\nthere is a broom for thee sweep all clean for us outside by the\\nbackdoor humph sweep for yourselves she answered i am not your\\nservant when she saw that they were not going to give her anything\\nshe went out by the door then the little men said to each other what\\nshall we give her as she is so naughty and has a wicked envious heart\\nthat will never let her do a good turn to any one the first said i\\ngrant that she may grow uglier every day the second said i grant\\nthat at every word she says a toad shall spring out of her mouth the\\nthird said i grant that she may die a miserable death the maiden\\nlooked for strawberries outside but as she found none she went\\nangrily home and when she opened her mouth and was about to tell her\\nmother what had happened to her in the wood with every word she said\\na toad sprang out of her mouth so that every one was seized with\\nhorror of her\\n\\nthen the stepmother was still more enraged and thought of nothing but\\nhow to do every possible injury to the mans daughter whose beauty\\nhowever grew daily greater at length she took a cauldron set it on\\nthe fire and boiled yarn in it when it was boiled she flung it on\\nthe poor girls shoulder and gave her an axe in order that she might\\ngo on the frozen river cut a hole in the ice and rinse the yarn she\\nwas obedient went thither and cut a hole in the ice and while she was\\nin the midst of her cutting a splendid carriage came driving up in\\nwhich sat the king the carriage stopped and the king askedmy child\\nwho are thou and what art thou doing here i am a poor girl and i\\nam rinsing yarn then the king felt compassion and when he saw that\\nshe was so very beautiful he said to her wilt thou go away with me\\nah yes with all my heart she answered for she was glad to get\\naway from the mother and sister\\n\\nso she got into the carriage and drove away with the king and when\\nthey arrived at his palace the wedding was celebrated with great pomp\\nas the little men had granted to the maiden when a year was over the\\nyoung queen bore a son and as the stepmother had heard of her great\\ngoodfortune she came with her daughter to the palace and pretended\\nthat she wanted to pay her a visit once however when the king had\\ngone out and no one else was present the wicked woman seized the\\nqueen by the head and her daughter seized her by the feet and they\\nlifted her out of the bed and threw her out of the window into the\\nstream which flowed by then the ugly daughter laid herself in the bed\\nand the old woman covered her up over her head when the king came home\\nagain and wanted to speak to his wife the old woman cried hush\\nhush that cant be now she is lying in a violent perspiration you\\nmust let her rest today the king suspected no evil and did not come\\nback again till next morning and as he talked with his wife and she\\nanswered him with every word a toad leaped out whereas formerly a\\npiece of gold had fallen out then he asked what that could be but the\\nold woman said that she had got that from the violent perspiration and\\nwould soon lose it again during the night however the scullion saw a\\nduck come swimming up the gutter and it said\\n\\nking what art thou doing now\\nsleepest thou or wakest thou\\n\\n\\nand as he returned no answer it said\\n\\nand my guests what may they do\\n\\n\\nthe scullion said\\n\\nthey are sleeping soundly too\\n\\n\\nthen it asked again\\n\\nwhat does little baby mine\\n\\n\\nhe answered\\n\\nsleepeth in her cradle fine\\n\\n\\nthen she went upstairs in the form of the queen nursed the baby shook\\nup its little bed covered it over and then swam away again down the\\ngutter in the shape of a duck she came thus for two nights on the\\nthird she said to the scullion go and tell the king to take his\\nsword and swing it three times over me on the threshold then the\\nscullion ran and told this to the king who came with his sword and\\nswung it thrice over the spirit and at the third time his wife stood\\nbefore him strong living and healthy as she had been before\\nthereupon the king was full of great joy but he kept the queen hidden\\nin a chamber until the sunday when the baby was to be christened and\\nwhen it was christened he said what does a person deserve who drags\\nanother out of bed and throws him in the water the wretch deserves\\nnothing better answered the old woman than to be taken and put in a\\nbarrel stuck full of nails and rolled down hill into the water\\nthen said the king thou hast pronounced thine own sentence and\\nhe ordered such a barrel to be brought and the old woman to be put\\ninto it with her daughter and then the top was hammered on and the\\nbarrel rolled down hill

out into the forest to where it is\\nthe thickest there we will light a fire for them and give each of\\nthem one piece of bread more and then we will go to our work and leave\\nthem alone they will not find the way home again and we shall be rid\\nof them no wife said the man i will not do that how can i bear\\nto leave my children alone in the forest—the wild animals would soon\\ncome and tear them to pieces o thou fool said she then we must\\nall four die of hunger thou mayest as well plane the planks for our\\ncoffins and she left him no peace until he consented but i feel\\nvery sorry for the poor children all the same said the man\\n\\nthe two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger and had\\nheard what their stepmother had said to their father grethel wept\\nbitter tears and said to hansel now all is over with us be quiet\\ngrethel said hansel do not distress thyself i will soon find a way\\nto help us and when the old folks had fallen asleep he got up put\\non his little coat opened the door below and crept outside the moon\\nshone brightly and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house\\nglittered like real silver pennies hansel stooped and put as many of\\nthem in the little pocket of his coat as he could possibly get in then\\nhe went back and said to grethel be comforted dear little sister\\nand sleep in peace god will not forsake us and he lay down again in\\nhis bed when day dawned but before the sun had risen the woman came\\nand awoke the two children saying get up you sluggards we are going\\ninto the forest to fetch wood she gave each a little piece of bread\\nand said there is something for your dinner but do not eat it up\\nbefore then for you will get nothing else grethel took the bread\\nunder her apron as hansel had the stones in his pocket then they all\\nset out together on the way to the forest when they had walked a short\\ntime hansel stood still and peeped back at the house and did so again\\nand again his father said hansel what art thou looking at there and\\nstaying behind for mind what thou art about and do not forget how to\\nuse thy legs ah father said hansel i am looking at my little\\nwhite cat which is sitting up on the roof and wants to say goodbye\\nto me the wife said fool that is not thy little cat that is the\\nmorning sun which is shining on the chimneys hansel however had not\\nbeen looking back at the cat but had been constantly throwing one of\\nthe white pebblestones out of his pocket on the road\\n\\nwhen they had reached the middle of the forest the father said now\\nchildren pile up some wood and i will light a fire that you may not\\nbe cold hansel and grethel gathered brushwood together as high as a\\nlittle hill the brushwood was lighted and when the flames were\\nburning very high the woman said now children lay yourselves down\\nby the fire and rest we will go into the forest and cut some wood\\nwhen we have done we will come back and fetch you away\\n\\nhansel and grethel sat by the fire and when noon came each ate a\\nlittle piece of bread and as they heard the strokes of the woodaxe\\nthey believed that their father was near it was not however the axe\\nit was a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind\\nwas blowing backwards and forwards and as they had been sitting such a\\nlong time their eyes shut with fatigue and they fell fast asleep\\nwhen at last they awoke it was already dark night grethel began to\\ncry and said how are we to get out of the forest now but hansel\\ncomforted her and said just wait a little until the moon has risen\\nand then we will soon find the way and when the full moon had risen\\nhansel took his little sister by the hand and followed the pebbles\\nwhich shone like newlycoined silver pieces and showed them the way\\n\\nthey walked the whole night long and by break of day came once more to\\ntheir fathers house they knocked at the door and when the woman\\nopened it and saw that it was hansel and grethel she said you\\nnaughty children why have you slept so long in the forest—we thought\\nyou were never coming back at all the father however rejoiced for\\nit had cut him to the heart to leave them behind alone\\n\\nnot long afterwards there was once more great scarcity in all parts\\nand the children heard their mother saying at night to their father\\neverything is eaten again we have one half loaf left and after that\\nthere is an end the children must go we will take them farther into\\nthe wood so that they will not find their way out again there is no\\nother means of saving ourselves the mans heart was heavy and he\\nthought it would be better for thee to share the last mouthful with\\nthy children the woman however would listen to nothing that he had\\nto say but scolded and reproached him he who says a must say b\\nlikewise and as he had yielded the first time he had to do so a\\nsecond time also\\n\\nthe children were however still awake and had heard the conversation\\nwhen the old folks were asleep hansel again got up and wanted to go\\nout and pick up pebbles as he had done before but the woman had locked\\nthe door and hansel could not get out nevertheless he comforted his\\nlittle sister and said do not cry grethel go to sleep quietly the\\ngood god will help us\\n\\nearly in the morning came the woman and took the children out of their\\nbeds their bit of bread was given to them but it was still smaller\\nthan the time before on the way into the forest hansel crumbled his in\\nhis pocket and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground\\nhansel why dost thou stop and look round said the father go on\\ni am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof\\nand wants to say goodbye to me answered hansel simpleton said\\nthe woman that is not thy little pigeon that is the morning sun that\\nis shining on the chimney hansel however little by little threw\\nall the crumbs on the path\\n\\nthe woman led the children still deeper into the forest where they had\\nnever in their lives been before then a great fire was again made and\\nthe mother said just sit there you children and when you are tired\\nyou may sleep a little we are going into the forest to cut wood and\\nin the evening when we are done we will come and fetch you away when\\nit was noon grethel shared her piece of bread with hansel who had\\nscattered his by the way then they fell asleep and evening came and\\nwent but no one came to the poor children they did not awake until it\\nwas dark night and hansel comforted his little sister and said just\\nwait grethel until the moon rises and then we shall see the crumbs\\nof bread which i have strewn about they will show us our way home\\nagain when the moon came they set out but they found no crumbs for\\nthe many thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had\\npicked them all up hansel said to grethel we shall soon find the\\nway but they did not find it they walked the whole night and all the\\nnext day too from morning till evening but they did not get out of the\\nforest and were very hungry for they had nothing to eat but two or\\nthree berries which grew on the ground and as they were so weary that\\ntheir legs would carry them no longer they lay down beneath a tree and\\nfell asleep\\n\\nit was now three mornings since they had left their fathers house\\nthey began to walk again but they always got deeper into the forest\\nand if help did not come soon they must die of hunger and weariness\\nwhen it was midday they saw a beautiful snowwhite bird sitting on a\\nbough which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to\\nit and when it had finished its song it spread its wings and flew\\naway before them and they followed it until they reached a little\\nhouse on the roof of which it alighted and when they came quite up to\\nlittle house they saw that it was built of bread and covered with\\ncakes but that the windows were of clear sugar we will set to work\\non that said hansel and have a good meal i will eat a bit of the\\nroof and thou grethel canst eat some of the window it will taste\\nsweet hansel reached up above and broke off a little of the roof to\\ntry how it tasted and grethel leant against the window and nibbled at\\nthe panes then a soft voice cried from the room\\n\\nnibble nibble gnaw\\nwho is nibbling at my little house\\n\\n\\nthe children answered\\n\\nthe wind the wind\\nthe heavenborn wind\\n\\n\\nand went on eating without disturbing themselves hansel who thought\\nthe roof tasted very nice tore down a great piece of it and grethel\\npushed out the whole of one round windowpane sat down and enjoyed\\nherself with it suddenly the door opened and a very very old woman\\nwho supported herself on crutches came creeping out hansel and\\ngrethel were so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in\\ntheir hands the old woman however nodded her head and said oh\\nyou dear children who has brought you here do come in and stay with\\nme no harm shall happen to you she took them both by the hand and\\nled them into her little house then good food was set before them\\nmilk and pancakes with sugar apples and nuts afterwards two pretty\\nlittle beds were covered with clean white linen and hansel and grethel\\nlay down in them and thought they were in heaven\\n\\nthe old woman had only pretended to be so kind she was in reality a\\nwicked witch who lay in wait for children and had only built the\\nlittle house of bread in order to entice them there when a child fell\\ninto her power she killed it cooked and ate it and that was a feast\\nday with her witches have red eyes and cannot see far but they have\\na keen scent like the beasts and are aware when human beings draw\\nnear when hansel and grethel came into her neighborhood she laughed\\nmaliciously and said mockingly i have them they shall not escape me\\nagain early in the morning before the children were awake she was\\nalready up and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so\\npretty with their plump red cheeks she muttered to herself that\\nwill be a dainty mouthful then she seized hansel with her shrivelled\\nhand carried him into a little stable and shut him in with a grated\\ndoor he might scream as he liked that was of no use then she went to\\ngrethel shook her till she awoke and cried get up lazy thing\\nfetch some water and cook something good for thy brother he is in the\\nstable outside and is to be made fat when he is fat i will eat him\\ngrethel began to weep bitterly but it was all in vain she was forced\\nto do what the wicked witch ordered her\\n\\nand now the best food was cooked for poor hansel but grethel got\\nnothing but crabshells every morning the woman crept to the little\\nstable and cried hansel stretch out thy finger that i may feel if\\nthou wilt soon be fat hansel however stretched out a little bone to\\nher and the old woman who had dim eyes could not see it and thought\\nit was hansels finger and was astonished that there was no way of\\nfattening him when four weeks had gone by and hansel still continued\\nthin she was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer\\nhola grethel she cried to the girl be active and bring some\\nwater let hansel be fat or lean tomorrow i will kill him and cook\\nhim ah how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch\\nthe water and how her tears did flow down over her cheeks dear god\\ndo help us she cried if the wild beasts in the forest had but\\ndevoured us we should at any rate have died together just keep thy\\nnoise to thyself said the old woman all that wont help thee at\\nall\\n\\nearly in the morning grethel had to go out and hang up the cauldron\\nwith the water and light the fire we will bake first said the old\\nwoman i have already heated the oven and kneaded the dough she\\npushed poor grethel out to the oven from which flames of fire were\\nalready darting creep in said the witch and see if it is properly\\nheated so that we can shut the bread in and when once grethel was\\ninside she intended to shut the oven and let her bake in it and then\\nshe would eat her too but grethel saw what she had in her mind and\\nsaid i do not know how i am to do it how do you get in silly\\ngoose said the old woman the door is big enough just look i can\\nget in myself and she crept up and thrust her head into the oven\\nthen grethel gave her a push that drove her far into it and shut the\\niron door and fastened the bolt oh then she began to howl quite\\nhorribly but grethel ran away and the godless witch was miserably\\nburnt to death\\n\\ngrethel however ran like lightning to hansel opened his little\\nstable and cried hansel we are saved the old witch is dead then\\nhansel sprang out like a bird from its cage when the door is opened for\\nit how they did rejoice and embrace each other and dance about and\\nkiss each other and as they had no longer any need to fear her they\\nwent into the witchs house and in every corner there stood chests\\nfull of pearls and jewels these are far better than pebbles said\\nhansel and thrust into his pockets whatever could be got in and\\ngrethel said i too will take something home with me and filled\\nher pinafore full but now we will go away said hansel that we may\\nget out of the witchs forest\\n\\nwhen they had walked for two hours they came to a great piece of\\nwater we cannot get over said hansel i see no footplank and no\\nbridge and no boat crosses either answered grethel but a white\\nduck is swimming there if i ask her she will help us over then she\\ncried\\n\\nlittle duck little duck dost thou see\\nhansel and grethel are waiting for thee\\ntheres never a plank or bridge in sight\\ntake us across on thy back so white\\n\\n\\nthe duck came to them and hansel seated himself on its back and told\\nhis sister to sit by him no replied grethel that will be too\\nheavy for the little duck she shall take us across one after the\\nother the good little duck did so and when they were once safely\\nacross and had walked for a short time the forest seemed to be more\\nand more familiar to them and at length they saw from afar their\\nfathers house then they began to run rushed into the parlour and\\nthrew themselves into their fathers arms the man had not known one\\nhappy hour since he had left the children in the forest the woman\\nhowever was dead grethel emptied her pinafore until pearls and\\nprecious stones ran about the room and hansel threw one handful after\\nanother out of his pocket to add to them then all anxiety was at an\\nend and they lived together in perfect happiness my tale is done\\nthere runs a mouse whosoever catches it may make himself a big fur\\ncap out of it',\n",

and with him went out to\\nfight and when he came before the enemy there was a battle and great\\ndanger and it rained shot until his comrades fell on all sides and\\nwhen the leader also was killed those left were about to take flight\\nbut the youth stepped forth spoke boldly to them and cried we will\\nnot let our fatherland be ruined then the others followed him and he\\npressed on and conquered the enemy when the king heard that he owed\\nthe victory to him alone he raised him above all the others gave him\\ngreat treasures and made him the first in the kingdom\\n\\nthe king had a daughter who was very beautiful but she was also very\\nstrange she had made a vow to take no one as her lord and husband who\\ndid not promise to let himself be buried alive with her if she died\\nfirst if he loves me with all his heart said she of what use will\\nlife be to him afterwards on her side she would do the same and if\\nhe died first would go down to the grave with him this strange oath\\nhad up to this time frightened away all wooers but the youth became so\\ncharmed with her beauty that he cared for nothing but asked her father\\nfor her but dost thou know what thou must promise said the king i\\nmust be buried with her he replied if i outlive her but my love is\\nso great that i do not mind the danger then the king consented and\\nthe wedding was solemnized with great splendour\\n\\nthey lived now for a while happy and contented with each other and\\nthen it befell that the young queen was attacked by a severe illness\\nand no physician could save her and as she lay there dead the young\\nking remembered what he had been obliged to promise and was horrified\\nat having to lie down alive in the grave but there was no escape the\\nking had placed sentries at all the gates and it was not possible to\\navoid his fate when the day came when the corpse was to be buried he\\nwas taken down into the royal vault with it and then the door was shut\\nand bolted\\n\\nnear the coffin stood a table on which were four candles four loaves\\nof bread and four bottles of wine and when this provision came to an\\nend he would have to die of hunger and now he sat there full of pain\\nand grief ate every day only a little piece of bread drank only a\\nmouthful of wine and nevertheless saw death daily drawing nearer\\nwhilst he thus gazed before him he saw a snake creep out of a corner\\nof the vault and approach the dead body and as he thought it came to\\ngnaw at it he drew his sword and said as long as i live thou shalt\\nnot touch her and hewed the snake in three pieces after a time a\\nsecond snake crept out of the hole and when it saw the other lying\\ndead and cut in pieces it went back but soon came again with three\\ngreen leaves in its mouth then it took the three pieces of the snake\\nlaid them together as they ought to go and placed one of the leaves\\non each wound immediately the severed parts joined themselves\\ntogether the snake moved and became alive again and both of them\\nhastened away together the leaves were left lying on the ground and a\\ndesire came into the mind of the unhappy man who had been watching all\\nthis to know if the wondrous power of the leaves which had brought the\\nsnake to life again could not likewise be of service to a human being\\nso he picked up the leaves and laid one of them on the mouth of his\\ndead wife and the two others on her eyes and hardly had he done this\\nthan the blood stirred in her veins rose into her pale face and\\ncoloured it again then she drew breath opened her eyes and said\\nah god where am i thou art with me dear wife he answered and\\ntold her how everything had happened and how he had brought her back\\nagain to life then he gave her some wine and bread and when she had\\nregained her strength he raised her up and they went to the door and\\nknocked and called so loudly that the sentries heard it and told the\\nking the king came down himself and opened the door and there he\\nfound both strong and well and rejoiced with them that now all sorrow\\nwas over the young king however took the three snakeleaves with\\nhim gave them to a servant and said keep them for me carefully and\\ncarry them constantly about thee who knows in what trouble they may\\nyet be of service to us\\n\\na change had however taken place in his wife after she had been\\nrestored to life it seemed as if all love for her husband had gone out\\nof her heart after some time when he wanted to make a voyage over the\\nsea to visit his old father and they had gone on board a ship she\\nforgot the great love and fidelity which he had shown her and which\\nhad been the means of rescuing her from death and conceived a wicked\\ninclination for the skipper and once when the young king lay there\\nasleep she called in the skipper and seized the sleeper by the head\\nand the skipper took him by the feet and thus they threw him down into\\nthe sea when the shameful deed was done she said now let us return\\nhome and say that he died on the way i will extol and praise thee so\\nto my father that he will marry me to thee and make thee the heir to\\nhis crown but the faithful servant who had seen all that they did\\nunseen by them unfastened a little boat from the ship got into it\\nsailed after his master and let the traitors go on their way he\\nfished up the dead body and by the help of the three snakeleaves\\nwhich he carried about with him and laid on the eyes and mouth he\\nfortunately brought the young king back to life\\n\\nthey both rowed with all their strength day and night and their little\\nboat flew so swiftly that they reached the old king before the others\\ndid he was astonished when he saw them come alone and asked what had\\nhappened to them when he learnt the wickedness of his daughter he\\nsaid i cannot believe that she has behaved so ill but the truth will\\nsoon come to light and bade both go into a secret chamber and keep\\nthemselves hidden from every one soon afterwards the great ship came\\nsailing in and the godless woman appeared before her father with a\\ntroubled countenance he said why dost thou come back alone where is\\nthy husband ah dear father she replied i come home again in\\ngreat grief during the voyage my husband became suddenly ill and\\ndied and if the good skipper had not

       " 'a long time ago there lived a king who was famed for his wisdom through\\nall the land nothing was hidden from him and it seemed as if news of\\nthe most secret things was brought to him through the air but he had a\\nstrange custom every day after dinner when the table was cleared and\\nno one else was present a trusty servant had to bring him one more\\ndish it was covered however and even the servant did not know what\\nwas in it neither did anyone know for the king never took off the\\ncover to eat of it until he was quite alone\\n\\nthis had gone on for a long time when one day the servant who took\\naway the dish was overcome with such curiosity that he could not help\\ncarrying the dish into his room when he had carefully locked the door\\nhe lifted up the cover and saw a white snake lying on the dish but\\nwhen he saw it he could not deny himself the pleasure of tasting it so\\nhe cut off a little bit and put it into his mouth no sooner had it\\ntouched his tongue than he heard a strange whispering of little voices\\noutside his window he went and listened and then noticed that it was\\nthe sparrows who were chattering together and telling one another of\\nall kinds of things which they had seen in the fields and woods eating\\nthe snake had given him power of understanding the language of animals\\n\\nnow it so happened that on this very day the queen lost her most\\nbeautiful ring and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this trusty\\nservant who was allowed to go everywhere the king ordered the man to\\nbe brought before him and threatened with angry words that unless he\\ncould before the morrow point out the thief he himself should be\\nlooked upon as guilty and executed in vain he declared his innocence\\nhe was dismissed with no better answer\\n\\nin his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took\\nthought how to help himself out of his trouble now some ducks were\\nsitting together quietly by a brook and taking their rest and whilst\\nthey were making their feathers smooth with their bills they were\\nhaving a confidential conversation together the servant stood by and\\nlistened they were telling one another of all the places where they\\nhad been waddling about all the morning and what good food they had\\nfound and one said in a pitiful tone something lies heavy on my\\nstomach as i was eating in haste i swallowed a ring which lay under\\nthe queens window the servant at once seized her by the neck\\ncarried her to the kitchen and said to the cook here is a fine duck\\npray kill her yes said the cook and weighed her in his hand\\nshe has spared no trouble to fatten herself and has been waiting to\\nbe roasted long enough so he cut off her head and as she was being\\ndressed for the spit the queens ring was found inside her\\n\\nthe servant could now easily prove his innocence and the king to make\\namends for the wrong allowed him to ask a favor and promised him the\\nbest place in the court that he could wish for the servant refused\\neverything and only asked for a horse and some money for traveling as\\nhe had a mind to see the world and go about a little\\n\\nwhen his request was granted he set out on his way and one day came to\\na pond where he saw three fishes caught in the reeds and gasping for\\nwater now though it is said that fishes are dumb he heard them\\nlamenting that they must perish so miserably and as he had a kind\\nheart he got off his horse and put the three prisoners back into the\\nwater they quivered with delight put out their heads and cried to\\nhim we will remember you and repay you for saving us\\n\\nhe rode on and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a voice in\\nthe sand at his feet he listened and heard an antking complain why\\ncannot folks with their clumsy beasts keep off our bodies that\\nstupid horse with his heavy hoofs has been treading down my people\\nwithout mercy so he turned on to a side path and the antking cried\\nout to him we will remember you—one good turn deserves another\\n\\nthe path led him into a wood and here he saw two old ravens standing\\nby their nest and throwing out their young ones out with you you\\nidle goodfornothing creatures cried they we cannot find food for\\nyou any longer you are big enough and can provide for yourselves\\nbut the poor young ravens lay upon the ground flapping their wings\\nand crying oh what helpless chicks we are we must shift for\\nourselves and yet we cannot fly what can we do but lie here and\\nstarve so the good young fellow alighted and killed his horse with\\nhis sword and gave it to them for food then they came hopping up to\\nit satisfied their hunger and cried we will remember you—one good\\nturn deserves another\\n\\nand now he had to use his own legs and when he had walked a long way\\nhe came to a large city there was a great noise and crowd in the\\nstreets and a man rode up on horseback crying aloud the kings\\ndaughter wants a husband but whoever sues for her hand must perform a\\nhard task and if he does not succeed he will forfeit his life many\\nhad already made the attempt but in vain nevertheless when the youth\\nsaw the kings daughter he was so overcome by her great beauty that he\\nforgot all danger went before the king and declared himself a suitor\\n\\nso he was led out to the sea and a gold ring was thrown into it in\\nhis sight then the king ordered him to fetch this ring up from the\\nbottom of the sea and added if you come up again without it you will\\nbe thrown in again and again until you perish amid the waves all the\\npeople grieved for the handsome youth then they went away leaving him\\nalone by the sea\\n\\nhe stood on the shore and considered what he should do when suddenly\\nhe saw three fishes come swimming towards him and they were the very\\nfishes whose lives he had saved the one in the middle held a mussel in\\nits mouth which it laid on the shore at the youths feet and when he\\nhad taken it up and opened it there lay the gold ring in the shell\\nfull of joy he took it to the king and expected that he would grant\\nhim the promised reward\\n\\nbut when the proud princess perceived that he was not her equal in\\nbirth she scorned him and required him first to perform another task\\nshe went down into the garden and strewed with her own hands ten\\nsacksfull of milletseed on the grass then she said tomorrow\\nmorning before sunrise these must be picked up and not a single grain\\nbe wanting\\n\\nthe youth sat down in the garden and considered how it might be\\npossible to perform this task but he could think of nothing and there\\nhe sat sorrowfully awaiting the break of day when he should be led to\\ndeath but as soon as the first rays of the sun shone into the garden\\nhe saw all the ten sacks standing side by side quite full and not a\\nsingle grain was missing the antking had come in the night with\\nthousands and thousands of ants and the grateful creatures had by\\ngreat industry picked up all the milletseed and gathered them into the\\nsacks\\n\\npresently the kings daughter herself came down into the garden and\\nwas amazed to see that the young man had done the task she had given\\nhim but she could not yet conquer her proud heart and said although\\nhe has performed both the tasks he shall not be my husband until he\\nhas brought me an apple from the tree of life\\n\\nthe youth did not know where the tree of life stood but he set out\\nand would have gone on for ever as long as his legs would carry him\\nthough he had no hope of finding it after he had wandered through\\nthree kingdoms he came one evening to a wood and lay down under a\\ntree to sleep but he heard a rustling in the branches and a golden\\napple fell into his hand at the same time three ravens flew down to\\nhim perched themselves upon his knee and said we are the three\\nyoung ravens whom you saved from starving when we had grown big and\\nheard that you were seeking the golden apple we flew over the sea to\\nthe end of the world where the tree of life stands and have brought\\nyou the apple the youth full of joy set out homewards and took the\\ngolden apple to the kings beautiful daughter who had no more excuses\\nleft to make they cut the apple of life in two and ate it together\\nand then her heart became full of love for him and they lived in\\nundisturbed happiness to a great age',\n",

he\\nfound a great stone palace and his wife was just standing on the steps\\ngoing in and she took him by the hand and said come in so he went\\nin with her and in the castle was a great hall paved with marble and\\nmany servants who flung wide the doors and the walls were all bright\\nwith beautiful hangings and in the rooms were chairs and tables of\\npure gold and crystal chandeliers hung from the ceiling and all the\\nrooms and bedrooms had carpets and food and wine of the very best\\nwere standing on all the tables so that they nearly broke down beneath\\nit behind the house too there was a great courtyard with stables\\nfor horses and cows and the very best of carriages there was a\\nmagnificent large garden too with the most beautiful flowers and\\nfruittrees and a park quite half a mile long in which were stags\\ndeer and hares and everything that could be desired come said the\\nwoman isnt that beautiful yes indeed said the man now let it\\nbe and we will live in

wont be king i\\nwill go to the flounder for i will be king ah wife said the\\nman why do you want to be king i do not like to say that to him\\nwhy not said the woman go to him this instant i must be king so\\nthe man went and was quite unhappy because his wife wished to be king\\nit is not right it is not right thought he he did not wish to go\\nbut yet he went\\n\\nand when he came to the sea it was quite darkgrey and the water\\nheaved up from below and smelt putrid then he went and stood by it\\nand said\\n\\nflounder flounder in the sea\\ncome i pray thee here to me\\nfor my wife good ilsabil\\nwills not as id have her will\\n\\n\\nwell what does she want then said the flounder alas said the\\nman she wants to be king go to her she is king already\\n\\nso the man went and when he came to the palace the castle had become\\nmuch larger and had a great tower and magnificent ornaments and the\\nsentinel was standing before the door and there were numbers of\\nsoldiers with kettledrums and trumpets and when he went inside the\\nhouse everything was of real marble and gold with velvet covers and\\ngreat golden tassels then the doors of the hall were opened and there\\nwas the court in all its splendour and his wife was sitting on a high\\nthrone of gold and diamonds with a great crown of gold on her head\\nand a sceptre of pure gold and jewels in her hand and on both sides of\\nher stood her maidsinwaiting in a row each of them always one head\\nshorter than the last\\n\\nthen he went and stood before her and said ah wife and now you are\\nking yes said the woman now i am king so he stood and looked\\nat her and when he had looked at her thus for some time he said and\\nnow that you are king let all else be now we will wish for nothing\\nmore nay husband said

instantly so he was forced\\nto go as the man went however he was troubled in mind and thought\\nto himself it will not end well it will not end well emperor is too\\nshameless the flounder will at last be tired out\\n\\nwith that he reached the sea and the sea was quite black and thick\\nand began to boil up from below so that it threw up bubbles and such\\na sharp wind blew over it that it curdled and the man was afraid then\\nhe went and stood by it and said\\n\\nflounder flounder in the sea\\ncome i pray thee here to me\\nfor my wife good ilsabil\\nwills not as id have her will\\n\\n\\nwell what does she want then said the flounder alas flounder\\nsaid he my wife wants to be emperor go to her said the flounder\\nshe is emperor already\\n\\nso the man went and when he got there the whole palace was made of\\npolished marble with alabaster figures and golden ornaments and\\nsoldiers were marching before the door blowing trumpets and beating\\ncymbals and drums and in the house barons and counts and dukes were\\ngoing about as servants then they opened the doors to him which were\\nof pure gold and when he entered there sat his wife on a throne\\nwhich was made of one piece of gold and was quite two miles high and\\nshe wore a great golden crown that was three yards high and set with\\ndiamonds and carbuncles and in one hand she had the sceptre and in\\nthe other the imperial orb and on both sides of her stood the yeomen\\nof the guard in two rows each being smaller than the one before him\\nfrom the biggest giant who was two miles high to the very smallest\\ndwarf just as big as my little finger and before it stood a number of\\nprinces and dukes\\n\\nthen the man went and stood among them and said wife are you\\nemperor now yes said she now i am emperor then he stood and\\nlooked at her well and when he had looked at her thus for some time\\nhe said ah wife be content now that you are emperor husband\\nsaid she why are you standing there now i am emperor but i will be\\npope too go to the flounder alas wife said the man what will\\nyou not wish for you cannot be pope there is but one in christendom\\nhe cannot make you pope husband said she i will be pope go\\nimmediately i must be pope this very day no wife said the man\\ni do not like to say that to him that would not do it is too much\\nthe flounder cant make you pope husband said she what nonsense\\nif he can make an emperor he can make a pope go to him directly i am\\nemperor and you are nothing but my husband will you go at once\\n\\nthen he was afraid and went but he was quite faint and shivered and\\nshook and his knees and legs trembled and a high wind blew over the\\nland and the clouds flew and towards evening all grew dark and the\\nleaves fell from the trees and the water rose and roared as if it were\\nboiling and splashed upon the shore and in the distance he saw ships\\nwhich were firing guns in their sore need pitching and tossing on the\\nwaves and yet in the midst of the sky there was still a small bit of\\nblue though on every side it was as red as in a heavy storm so full\\nof despair he went and stood in much fear and said\\n\\nflounder flounder in the sea\\ncome i pray thee here to me\\nfor my wife good ilsabil\\nwills not as id have her will\\n\\n\\nwell what does she want then said the flounder alas said the\\nman she wants to be pope go to her then said the flounder she\\nis pope already\\n\\nso he went and when he got there he saw what seemed to be a large\\nchurch surrounded by palaces he pushed his way through the crowd\\ninside however everything was lighted up with thousands and thousands\\nof candles and his wife was clad in gold and she was sitting on a\\nmuch higher throne and had three great golden crowns on and round\\nabout her there was much ecclesiastical splendour and on both sides of\\nher was a row of candles the largest of which was as tall as the very\\ntallest tower down to the very smallest kitchen candle and all the\\nemperors and kings were on their knees before her kissing her shoe\\nwife said the man and looked attentively at her are you now\\npope yes said she i am pope so he stood and looked at her and\\nit was just as if he was looking at the bright sun when he had stood\\nlooking at her thus for a short time he said ah wife if you are\\npope do let well alone but she looked as stiff as a post and did\\nnot move or show any signs of life then said he wife now that you\\nare pope be satisfied you cannot become anything greater now i\\nwill consider about that said the woman thereupon they both went to\\nbed but she was not satisfied and greediness let her have no sleep\\nfor she was continually thinking what there was left for her to be\\n\\nthe man slept well and soundly for he had run about a great deal\\nduring the day but the woman could not fall asleep at all and flung\\nherself from one side to the other the whole night through thinking\\nalways what more was left for her to be but unable to call to mind\\nanything else at length the sun began to rise and when the woman saw\\nthe red of dawn she sat up in bed and looked at it and when through\\nthe window she saw the sun thus rising she said cannot i too\\norder the sun and moon to rise husband she said poking him in the\\nribs with her elbows wake up go to the flounder for i wish to be\\neven as god is the man was still half asleep but he was so horrified\\nthat he fell out of bed he thought he must have heard amiss and\\nrubbed his eyes and said alas wife what are you saying\\nhusband said she if i cant order the sun and moon to rise and\\nhave to look on and see the sun and moon rising i cant bear it i\\nshall not know what it is to have another happy hour unless i can make\\nthem rise myself then she looked at him so terribly that a shudder\\nran over him and said go at once i wish to be like unto god\\nalas wife said the man falling on his knees before her the\\nflounder cannot do that he can make an emperor and a pope i beseech\\nyou go on as you are and be pope then she fell into a rage and her\\nhair flew wildly about her head and she cried i will not endure\\nthis ill not bear it any longer wilt thou go then he put on his\\ntrousers and ran away like a madman but outside a great storm was\\nraging and blowing so hard that he could scarcely keep his feet\\nhouses and trees toppled over the mountains trembled rocks rolled\\ninto the sea the sky was pitch black and it thundered and lightened\\nand the sea came in with black waves as high as churchtowers and\\nmountains and all with crests of white foam at the top then he cried\\nbut could not hear his own words\\n\\nflounder flounder in the sea\\ncome i pray thee here to me\\nfor my wife good ilsabil\\nwills not as id have her will\\n\\n\\nwell what does she want then said the flounder alas said he\\nshe wants to be like unto god go to her and you will find her back\\nagain in the

       " 'one summers morning a little tailor was sitting on his table by the\\nwindow he was in good spirits and sewed with all his might then came\\na peasant woman down the street crying good jams cheap good jams\\ncheap this rang pleasantly in the tailors ears he stretched his\\ndelicate head out of the window and called come up here dear woman\\nhere you will get rid of your goods the woman came up the three steps\\nto the tailor with her heavy basket and he made her unpack the whole\\nof the pots for him he inspected all of them lifted them up put his\\nnose to them and at length said the jam seems to me to be good so\\nweigh me out four ounces dear woman and if it is a quarter of a pound\\nthat is of no consequence the woman who had hoped to find a good\\nsale gave him what he desired but went away quite angry and\\ngrumbling now god bless the jam to my use cried the little tailor\\nand give me health and strength so he brought the bread out of the\\ncupboard cut himself a piece right across the loaf and spread the jam\\nover it this wont taste bitter said he but i will just finish\\nthe jacket before i take a bite he laid the bread near him sewed on\\nand in his joy made bigger and bigger stitches in the meantime the\\nsmell of the sweet jam ascended so to the wall where the flies were\\nsitting in great numbers that they were attracted and descended on it\\nin hosts hola who invited you said the little tailor and drove\\nthe unbidden guests away the flies however who understood no german\\nwould not be turned away but came back again in everincreasing\\ncompanies the little tailor at last lost all patience and got a bit\\nof cloth from the hole under his worktable and saying wait and i\\nwill give it to you struck it mercilessly on them when he drew it\\naway and counted there lay before him no fewer than seven dead and\\nwith legs stretched out art thou a fellow of that sort said he and\\ncould not help admiring his own bravery the whole town shall know of\\nthis and the little tailor hastened to cut himself a girdle stitched\\nit and embroidered on it in large letters seven at one stroke\\nwhat the town he continued the whole world shall hear of it and\\nhis heart wagged with joy like a lambs tail the tailor put on the\\ngirdle and resolved to go forth into the world because he thought his\\nworkshop was too small for his valour before he went away he sought\\nabout in the house to see if there was anything which he could take\\nwith him however he found nothing but an old cheese and that he put\\nin his pocket in front of the door he observed a bird which had caught\\nitself in the thicket it had to go into his pocket with the cheese\\nnow he took to the road boldly and as he was light and nimble he felt\\nno fatigue the road led him up a mountain and when he had reached the\\nhighest point of it there sat a powerful giant looking about him quite\\ncomfortably the little tailor went bravely up spoke to him and said\\ngood day comrade so thou art sitting there overlooking the\\nwidespread world i am just on my way thither and want to try my\\nluck hast thou any inclination to go with me the giant looked\\ncontemptuously at the tailor and said thou ragamuffin thou\\nmiserable creature\\n\\noh indeed answered the little tailor and unbuttoned his coat and\\nshowed the giant the girdle there mayst thou read what kind of a man\\ni am the giant read seven at one stroke and thought that they had\\nbeen men whom the tailor had killed and began to feel a little respect\\nfor the tiny fellow nevertheless he wished to try him first and took\\na stone in his hand and squeezed it together so that water dropped out\\nof it do that likewise said the giant if thou hast strength is\\nthat all said the tailor that is childs play with us and put his\\nhand into his pocket brought out the soft cheese and pressed it until\\nthe liquid ran out of it faith said he that was a little better\\nwasnt it the giant did not know what to say and could not believe\\nit of the little man then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so\\nhigh that the eye could scarcely follow it now little mite of a man\\ndo that likewise well thrown said the tailor but after all the\\nstone came down to earth again i will throw you one which shall never\\ncome back at all and he put his hand into his pocket took out the\\nbird and threw it into the air the bird delighted with its liberty\\nrose flew away and did not come back how does that shot please you\\ncomrade asked the tailor thou canst certainly throw said the\\ngiant but now we will see if thou art able to carry anything\\nproperly he took the little tailor to a mighty oak tree which lay\\nthere felled on the ground and said if thou art strong enough help\\nme to carry the tree out of the forest readily answered the little\\nman take thou the trunk on thy shoulders and i will raise up the\\nbranches and twigs after all they are the heaviest the giant took\\nthe trunk on his shoulder but the tailor seated himself on a branch\\nand the giant who could not look round had to carry away the whole\\ntree and the little tailor into the bargain he behind was quite\\nmerry and happy and whistled the song three tailors rode forth from\\nthe gate as if carrying the tree were childs play the giant after\\nhe had dragged the heavy burden part of the way could go no further\\nand cried hark you i shall have to let the tree fall the tailor\\nsprang nimbly down seized the tree with both arms as if he had been\\ncarrying it and said to the giant thou art such a great fellow and\\nyet canst not even carry the tree\\n\\nthey went on together and as they passed a cherrytree the giant laid\\nhold of the top of the tree where the ripest fruit was hanging bent it\\ndown gave it into the tailors hand and bade him eat but the little\\ntailor was much too weak to hold the tree and when the giant let it\\ngo it sprang back again and the tailor was hurried into the air with\\nit when he had fallen down again without injury the giant said what\\nis this hast thou not strength enough to hold the weak twig there\\nis no lack of strength answered the little tailor dost thou think\\nthat could be anything to a man who has struck down seven at one blow\\ni leapt over the tree because the huntsmen are shooting down there in\\nthe thicket jump as i did if thou canst do it the giant made the\\nattempt but could not get over the tree and remained hanging in the\\nbranches so that in this also the tailor kept the upper hand\\n\\nthe giant said if thou art such a valiant fellow come with me into\\nour cavern and spend the night with us the little tailor was willing\\nand followed him when they went into the cave other giants were\\nsitting there by the fire and each of them had a roasted sheep in his\\nhand and was eating it the little tailor looked round and thought it\\nis much more spacious here than in my workshop the giant showed him a\\nbed and said he was to lie down in it and sleep the bed however was\\ntoo big for the little tailor he did not lie down in it but crept\\ninto a corner when it was midnight and the giant thought that the\\nlittle tailor was lying in a sound sleep he got up took a great iron\\nbar cut through the bed with one blow and thought he had given the\\ngrasshopper his finishing stroke with the earliest dawn the giants\\nwent into the forest and had quite forgotten the little tailor when\\nall at once he walked up to them quite merrily and boldly the giants\\nwere terrified they were afraid that he would strike them all dead\\nand ran away in a great hurry\\n\\nthe little tailor went onwards always following his own pointed nose\\nafter he had walked for a long time he came to the courtyard of a\\nroyal palace and as he felt weary he lay down on the grass and fell\\nasleep whilst he lay there the people came and inspected him on all\\nsides and read on his girdle seven at one stroke ah said they\\nwhat does the great warrior here in the midst of peace he must be a\\nmighty lord they went and announced him to the king and gave it as\\ntheir opinion that if war should break out this would be a weighty and\\nuseful man who ought on no account to be allowed to depart the counsel\\npleased the king and he sent one of his courtiers to the little tailor\\nto offer him military service when he awoke the ambassador remained\\nstanding by the sleeper waited until he stretched his limbs and opened\\nhis eyes and then conveyed to him this proposal for this very reason\\nhave i come here the tailor replied i am ready to enter the kings\\nservice he was therefore honorably received and a special dwelling\\nwas assigned him\\n\\nthe soldiers however were set against the little tailor and wished\\nhim a thousand miles away what is to be the end of this they said\\namongst themselves if we quarrel with him and he strikes about him\\nseven of us will fall at every blow not one of us can stand against\\nhim they came therefore to a decision betook themselves in a body to\\nthe king and begged for their dismissal we are not prepared said\\nthey to stay with a man who kills seven at one stroke the king was\\nsorry that for the sake of one he should lose all his faithful\\nservants wished that he had never set eyes on the tailor and would\\nwillingly have been rid of him again but he did not venture to give\\nhim his dismissal for he dreaded lest he should strike him and all his\\npeople dead and place himself on the royal throne he thought about it\\nfor a long time and at last found good counsel he sent to the little\\ntailor and caused him to be informed that as he was such a great\\nwarrior he had one request to make to him in a forest of his country\\nlived two giants who caused great mischief with their robbing\\nmurdering ravaging and burning and no one could approach them\\nwithout putting himself in danger of death if the tailor conquered and\\nkilled these two giants he would give him his only daughter to wife\\nand half of his kingdom as a dowry likewise one hundred horsemen\\nshould go with him to assist him that would indeed be a fine thing\\nfor a man like me thought the little tailor one is not offered a\\nbeautiful princess and half a kingdom every day of ones life oh\\nyes he replied i will soon subdue the giants and do not require\\nthe help of the hundred horsemen to do it he who can hit seven with\\none blow has no need to be afraid of two\\n\\nthe little tailor went forth and the hundred horsemen followed him\\nwhen he came to the outskirts of the forest he said to his followers\\njust stay waiting here i alone will soon finish off the giants then\\nhe bounded into the forest and looked about right and left after a\\nwhile he perceived both giants they lay sleeping under a tree and\\nsnored so that the branches waved up and down the little tailor not\\nidle gathered two pocketsful of stones and with these climbed up the\\ntree when he was halfway up he slipped down by a branch until he\\nsat just above the sleepers and then let one stone after another fall\\non the breast of one of the giants for a long time the giant felt\\nnothing but at last he awoke pushed his comrade and said why art\\nthou knocking me thou must be dreaming said the other i am not\\nknocking thee they laid themselves down to sleep again and then the\\ntailor threw a stone down on the second what is the meaning of this\\ncried the other why art thou pelting me i am not pelting thee\\nanswered the first growling they disputed about it for a time but as\\nthey were weary they let the matter rest and their eyes closed once\\nmore the little tailor began his game again picked out the biggest\\nstone and threw it with all his might on the breast of the first\\ngiant that is too bad cried he and sprang up like a madman and\\npushed his companion against the tree until it shook the other paid\\nhim back in the same coin and they got into such a rage that they tore\\nup trees and belabored each other so long that at last they both fell\\ndown dead on the ground at the same time then the little tailor leapt\\ndown it is a lucky thing said he that they did not tear up the\\ntree on which i was sitting or i should have had to spring on to\\nanother like a squirrel but we tailors are nimble he drew out his\\nsword and gave each of them a couple of thrusts in the breast and then\\nwent out to the horsemen and said the work is done i have given both\\nof them their finishing stroke but it was hard work they tore up\\ntrees in their sore need and defended themselves with them but all\\nthat is to no purpose when a man like myself comes who can kill seven\\nat one blow but are you not wounded asked the horsemen you need\\nnot concern yourself about that answered the tailor they have not\\nbent one hair of mine the horsemen would not believe him and rode\\ninto the forest there they found the giants swimming in their blood\\nand all round about lay the tornup trees\\n\\nthe little tailor demanded of the king the promised reward he\\nhowever repented of his promise and again bethought himself how he\\ncould get rid of the hero before thou receivest my daughter and the\\nhalf of my kingdom said he to him thou must perform one more heroic\\ndeed in the forest roams a unicorn which does great harm and thou\\nmust catch it first i fear one unicorn still less than two giants\\nseven at one blow is my kind of affair he took a rope and an axe\\nwith him went forth into the forest and again bade those who were\\nsent with him to wait outside he had to seek long the unicorn soon\\ncame towards him and rushed directly on the tailor as if it would\\nspit him on his horn without more ceremony softly softly it cant\\nbe done as quickly as that said he and stood still and waited until\\nthe animal was quite close and then sprang nimbly behind the tree the\\nunicorn ran against the tree with all its strength and struck its horn\\nso fast in the trunk that it had not strength enough to draw it out\\nagain and thus it was caught now i have got the bird said the\\ntailor and came out from behind the tree and put the rope round its\\nneck and then with his axe he hewed the horn out of the tree and when\\nall was ready he led the beast away and took it to the king\\n\\nthe king still would not give him the promised reward and made a third\\ndemand before the wedding the tailor was to catch him a wild boar that\\nmade great havoc in the forest and the huntsmen should give him their\\nhelp willingly said the tailor that is childs play he did not\\ntake the huntsmen with him into the forest and they were well pleased\\nthat he did not for the wild boar had several times received them in\\nsuch a manner that they had no inclination to lie in wait for him when\\nthe boar perceived the tailor it ran on him with foaming mouth and\\nwhetted tusks and was about to throw him to the ground but the active\\nhero sprang into a chapel which was near and up to the window at once\\nand in one bound out again the boar ran in after him but the tailor\\nran round outside and shut the door behind it and then the raging\\nbeast which was much too heavy and awkward to leap out of the window\\nwas caught the little tailor called the huntsmen thither that they\\nmight see the prisoner with their own eyes the hero however went to\\nthe king who was now whether he liked it or not obliged to keep his\\npromise and gave him his daughter and the half of his kingdom had he\\nknown that it was no warlike hero but a little tailor who was standing\\nbefore him it would have gone to his heart still more than it did the\\nwedding was held with great magnificence and small joy and out of a\\ntailor a king was made\\n\\nafter some time the young queen heard her husband say in his dreams at\\nnight boy make me the doublet and patch the pantaloons or else i\\nwill rap the yardmeasure over thine ears then she discovered in what\\nstate of life the young lord had been born and next morning complained\\nof her wrongs to her father and begged him to help her to get rid of\\nher husband who was nothing else but a tailor the king comforted her\\nand said leave thy bedroom door open this night and my servants\\nshall stand outside and when he has fallen asleep shall go in bind\\nhim and take him on board a ship which shall carry him into the wide\\nworld the woman was satisfied with this but the kings\\narmourbearer who had heard all was friendly with the young lord and\\ninformed him of the whole plot ill put a screw into that business\\nsaid the little tailor at night he went to bed with his wife at the\\nusual time and when she thought that he had fallen asleep she got up\\nopened the door and then lay down again the little tailor who was\\nonly pretending to be asleep began to cry out in a clear voice boy\\nmake me the doublet and patch me the pantaloons or i will rap the\\nyardmeasure over thine ears i smote seven at one blow i killed two\\ngiants i brought away one unicorn and caught a wild boar and am i to\\nfear those who are standing outside the room when these men heard the\\ntailor speaking thus they were overcome by a great dread and ran as\\nif the wild huntsman were behind them and none of them would venture\\nanything further against him so the little tailor was a king and\\nremained one to the end of his life',\n",

       " 'once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by every\\none who looked at her but most of all by her grandmother and there\\nwas nothing that she would not have given to the

little redcap here is a piece\\nof cake and a bottle of wine take them to your grandmother she is ill\\nand weak and they will do her good set out before it gets hot and\\nwhen you are going walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the\\npath or you may fall and break the bottle and then your grandmother\\nwill get nothing and when you go into her room dont forget to say\\ngoodmorning and dont peep into every corner before you do it\\n\\ni will take great care said little redcap to her mother and gave\\nher hand on it\\n\\nthe grandmother lived out in the wood half a league from the village\\nand just as little redcap entered the wood a wolf met her redcap\\ndid not know what a wicked creature he was and was not at all afraid\\nof him\\n\\ngoodday little redcap said he\\n\\nthank you kindly wolf\\n\\nwhither away so early little redcap\\n\\nto my grandmothers\\n\\nwhat have you got in your apron\\n\\ncake and wine yesterday was bakingday so poor sick grandmother is\\nto have something good to make her stronger\\n\\nwhere does your grandmother live little redcap\\n\\na good quarter of a league farther on in the wood her house stands\\nunder the three large oaktrees the nuttrees are just below you\\nsurely must know it replied little redcap\\n\\nthe wolf thought to himself what a tender young creature what a nice\\nplump mouthful—she will be better to eat than the old woman i must act\\ncraftily so as to catch both so he walked for a short time by the\\nside of little redcap and then he said see little redcap how\\npretty the flowers are about here—why do you not look round i believe\\ntoo that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing you\\nwalk gravely along as if you were going to school while everything\\nelse out here in the wood is merry\\n\\nlittle redcap raised her eyes and when she saw the sunbeams dancing\\nhere and there through the trees and pretty flowers growing\\neverywhere she thought suppose i take grandmother a fresh nosegay\\nthat would please her too it is so early in the day that i shall still\\nget there in good time and so she ran from the path into the wood to\\nlook for flowers and whenever she had picked one she fancied that she\\nsaw a still prettier one farther on and ran after it and so got\\ndeeper and deeper into the wood\\n\\nmeanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmothers house and knocked\\nat the door\\n\\nwho is there\\n\\nlittle redcap replied the wolf she is bringing cake and wine\\nopen the door\\n\\nlift the latch called out the grandmother i am too weak and\\ncannot get up\\n\\nthe wolf lifted the latch the door flew open and without saying a\\nword he went straight to the grandmothers bed and devoured her then\\nhe put on her clothes dressed himself in her cap laid himself in bed\\nand drew the curtains\\n\\nlittle redcap however had been running about picking flowers and\\nwhen she had gathered so many that she could carry no more she\\nremembered her grandmother and set out on the way to her\\n\\nshe was surprised to find the cottagedoor standing open and when she\\nwent into the room she had such a strange feeling that she said to\\nherself oh dear how uneasy i feel today and at other times i like\\nbeing with grandmother so much she called out good morning but\\nreceived no answer so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains\\nthere lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face and\\nlooking very strange\\n\\noh grandmother she said what big ears you have\\n\\nthe better to hear you with my child was the reply\\n\\nbut grandmother what big eyes you have she said\\n\\nthe better to see you with my dear\\n\\nbut grandmother what large hands you have\\n\\nthe better to hug you with\\n\\noh but grandmother what a terrible big mouth you have\\n\\nthe better to eat you with\\n\\nand scarcely had the wolf said this than with one bound he was out of\\nbed and swallowed up redcap\\n\\nwhen the wolf had appeased his appetite he lay down again in the bed\\nfell asleep and began to snore very loud the huntsman was just passing\\nthe house and thought to himself how the old woman is snoring i\\nmust just see if she wants anything so he went into the room and\\nwhen he came to the bed he saw that the wolf was lying in it do i\\nfind thee here thou old sinner said he i have long sought thee\\nthen just as he was going to fire at him it occurred to him that the\\nwolf might have devoured the grandmother and that she might still be\\nsaved so he did not fire but took a pair of scissors and began to\\ncut open the stomach of the sleeping wolf when he had made two snips\\nhe saw the little redcap shining and then he made two snips more and\\nthe little girl sprang out crying ah how frightened i have been\\nhow dark it was inside the wolf and after that the aged grandmother\\ncame out alive also but scarcely able to breathe redcap however\\nquickly fetched great stones with which they filled the wolfs body\\nand when he awoke he wanted to run away but the stones were so heavy\\nthat he fell down at once and fell dead\\n\\nthen all three were delighted the huntsman drew off the wolfs skin\\nand went home with it the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine\\nwhich redcap had brought and revived but redcap thought to herself\\nas long as i live i will never by myself leave the path to run into\\nthe wood when my mother has forbidden me to do so\\n\\n                                  \\n\\nit is also related that once when redcap was again taking cakes to the\\nold grandmother another wolf spoke to her and tried to entice her\\nfrom the path redcap however was on her guard and went straight\\nforward on her way and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf\\nand that he had said goodmorning to her but with such a wicked look\\nin his eyes that if they had not been on the public road she was\\ncertain he would have eaten her up well said the grandmother we\\nwill shut the door that he may not come in soon afterwards the wolf\\nknocked and cried open the door grandmother i am little redcap\\nand am fetching you some cakes but they did not speak or open the\\ndoor so the greybeard stole twice or thrice round the house and at\\nlast jumped on the roof intending to wait until redcap went home in\\nthe evening and then to steal after her and devour her in the\\ndarkness but the grandmother saw what was in his thoughts in front of\\nthe house was a great stone trough so she said to the child take the\\npail redcap i made some sausages yesterday so carry the water in\\nwhich i boiled them to the trough redcap carried until the great\\ntrough was quite full then the smell of the sausages reached the wolf\\nand he sniffed and peeped down and at last stretched out his neck so\\nfar that he could no longer keep his footing and began to slip and\\nslipped down from the roof straight into the great trough and was\\ndrowned but redcap went joyously home and never did anything to harm\\nany one',\n",

all goodness\\n\\nit happened that once in a storm the king went into the mill and he\\nasked the millfolk if the tall youth was their son no answered\\nthey hes a foundling fourteen years ago he floated down to the\\nmilldam in a box and the millboy pulled him out of the water\\n\\nthen the king knew that it was none other than the luckchild which he\\nhad thrown into the water and he said my good people could not the\\nyouth take a letter to the queen i will give him two gold pieces as a\\nreward just as the king commands answered they and they told the\\nboy to hold himself in readiness then the king wrote a letter to the\\nqueen wherein he said as soon as the boy arrives with this letter\\nlet him be killed and buried and all must be done before i come home\\n\\nthe boy set out with this letter but he lost his way and in the\\nevening came to a large forest in the darkness he saw a small light\\nhe went towards it and reached a cottage when he went in an old woman\\nwas sitting by the fire quite alone she started when she saw the boy\\nand said whence do you come and whither are you going i come from\\nthe mill he answered and wish to go to the queen to whom i am\\ntaking a letter but as i have lost my way in the forest i should like\\nto stay here over night you poor boy said the woman you have\\ncome into a den of thieves and when they come home they will kill\\nyou let them come said the boy i am not afraid but i am so\\ntired that i cannot go any farther and he stretched himself upon a\\nbench and fell asleep\\n\\nsoon afterwards the robbers came and angrily asked what strange boy\\nwas lying there ah said the old woman it is an innocent child who\\nhas lost himself in the forest and out of pity i have let him come in\\nhe has to take a letter to the queen the robbers opened the letter\\nand read it and in it was written that the boy as soon as he arrived\\nshould be put to death then the hardhearted robbers felt pity and\\ntheir leader tore up the letter and wrote another saying that as soon\\nas the boy came he should be married at once to the kings daughter\\nthen they let him lie quietly on the bench until the next morning and\\nwhen he awoke they gave him the letter and showed him the right way\\n\\nand the queen when she had received the letter and read it did as was\\nwritten in it and had a splendid weddingfeast prepared and the\\nkings daughter was married to the luckchild and as the youth was\\nhandsome and agreeable she lived with him in joy and contentment\\n\\nafter some time the king returned to his palace and saw that the\\nprophecy was fulfilled and the luckchild married to his daughter\\nhow has that come to pass said he i gave quite another order in my\\nletter\\n\\nso the queen gave him the letter and said that he might see for\\nhimself what was written in it the king read the letter and saw quite\\nwell that it had been exchanged for the other he asked the youth what\\nhad become of the letter entrusted to him and why he had brought\\nanother instead of it i know nothing about it answered he it must\\nhave been changed in the night when i slept in the forest the king\\nsaid in a passion you shall not have everything quite so much your\\nown way whosoever marries my daughter must fetch me from hell three\\ngolden hairs from the head of the devil bring me what i want and you\\nshall keep my daughter in this way the king hoped to be rid of him\\nfor ever but the luckchild answered i will fetch the golden hairs\\ni am not afraid of the devil thereupon he took leave of them and\\nbegan his journey\\n\\nthe road led him to a large town where the watchman by the gates asked\\nhim what his trade was and what he knew i know everything answered\\nthe luckchild then you can do us a favour said the watchman if\\nyou will tell us why our marketfountain which once flowed with wine\\nhas become dry and no longer gives even water that you shall know\\nanswered he only wait until i come back\\n\\nthen he went farther and came to another town and there also the\\ngatekeeper asked him what was his trade and what he knew i know\\neverything answered he then you can do us a favour and tell us why\\na tree in our town which once bore golden apples now does not even put\\nforth leaves you shall know that answered he only wait until i\\ncome back\\n\\nthen he went on and came to a wide river over which he must go the\\nferryman asked him what his trade was and what he knew i know\\neverything answered he then you can do me a favour said the\\nferryman and tell me why i must always be rowing backwards and\\nforwards and am never set free you shall know that answered he\\nonly wait until i come back\\n\\nwhen he had crossed the water he found the entrance to hell it was\\nblack and sooty within and the devil was not at home but his\\ngrandmother was sitting in a large armchair what do you want said\\nshe to him but she did not look so very wicked i should like to have\\nthree golden hairs from the devils head answered he else i cannot\\nkeep my wife that is a good deal to ask for said she if the\\ndevil comes home and finds you it will cost you your life but as i\\npity you i will see if i cannot help you\\n\\nshe changed him into an ant and said creep into the folds of my\\ndress you will be safe there yes answered he so far so good\\nbut there are three things besides that i want to know why a fountain\\nwhich once flowed with wine has become dry and no longer gives even\\nwater why a tree which once bore golden apples does not even put forth\\nleaves and why a ferryman must always be going backwards and\\nforwards and is never set free\\n\\nthose are difficult questions answered she but only be silent and\\nquiet and pay attention to what the devil says when i pull out the\\nthree golden hairs\\n\\nas the evening came on the devil returned home no sooner had he\\nentered than he noticed that the air was not pure i smell mans\\nflesh said he all is not right here then he pried into every\\ncorner and searched but could not find anything his grandmother\\nscolded him it has just been swept said she and everything put in\\norder and now you are upsetting it again you have always got mans\\nflesh in your nose sit down and eat your supper\\n\\nwhen he had eaten and drunk he was tired and laid his head in his\\ngrandmothers lap and before long he was fast asleep snoring and\\nbreathing heavily then the old woman took hold of a golden hair\\npulled it out and laid it down near her oh cried the devil what\\nare you doing i have had a bad dream answered the grandmother so\\ni seized hold of your hair what did you dream then said the devil\\ni dreamed that a fountain in a marketplace from which wine once\\nflowed was dried up and not even water would flow out of it what is\\nthe cause of it oh ho if they did but know it answered the\\ndevil there is a toad sitting under a stone in the well if they\\nkilled it the wine would flow again\\n\\nhe went to sleep again and snored until the windows shook then she\\npulled the second hair out ha what are you doing cried the devil\\nangrily do not take it ill said she i did it in a dream what\\nhave you dreamt this time asked he i dreamt that in a certain\\nkingdom there stood an appletree which had once borne golden apples\\nbut now would not even bear leaves what think you was the reason\\noh if they did but know answered the devil a mouse is gnawing at\\nthe root if they killed this they would have golden apples again but\\nif it gnaws much longer the tree will wither altogether but leave me\\nalone with your dreams if you disturb me in my sleep again you will\\nget a box on the ear\\n\\nthe grandmother spoke gently to him until he fell asleep again and\\nsnored then she took hold of the third golden hair and pulled it out\\nthe devil jumped up roared out and would have treated her ill if she\\nhad not quieted him once more and said who can help bad dreams\\nwhat was the dream then asked he and was quite curious i dreamt\\nof a ferryman who complained that he must always ferry from one side\\nto the other and was never released what is the cause of it ah\\nthe fool answered the devil when any one comes and wants to go\\nacross he must put the oar in his hand and the other man will have to\\nferry and he will be free as the grandmother had plucked out the\\nthree golden hairs and the three questions were answered she let the\\nold serpent alone and he slept until daybreak\\n\\nwhen the devil had gone out again the old woman took the ant out of the\\nfolds of her dress and gave the luckchild his human shape again\\nthere are the three golden hairs for you said she what the devil\\nsaid to your three questions i suppose you heard yes answered he\\ni heard and will take care to remember you have what you want\\nsaid she and now you can go your way he thanked the old woman for\\nhelping him in his need and left hell well content that everything had\\nturned out so fortunately\\n\\nwhen he came to the ferryman he was expected to give the promised\\nanswer ferry me across first said the luckchild and then i will\\ntell you how you can be set free and when he reached the opposite\\nshore he gave him the devils advice next time any one comes who\\nwants to be ferried over just put the oar in his hand\\n\\nhe went on and came to the town wherein stood the unfruitful tree and\\nthere too the watchman wanted an answer so he told him what he had\\nheard from the devil kill the mouse which is gnawing at its root and\\nit will again bear golden apples then the watchman thanked him and\\ngave him as a reward two asses laden with gold which followed him\\n\\nat last he came to the town whose well was dry he told the watchman\\nwhat the devil had said a toad is in the well beneath a stone you\\nmust find it and kill it and the well will again give wine in plenty\\nthe watchman thanked him and also gave him two asses laden with gold\\n\\nat last the luckchild got home to his wife who was heartily glad to\\nsee him again and to hear how well he had prospered in everything to\\nthe king he took what he had asked for the devils three golden hairs\\nand when the king saw the four asses laden with gold he was quite\\ncontent and said now all the conditions are fulfilled and you can\\nkeep my daughter but tell me dear soninlaw where did all that gold\\ncome from this is tremendous wealth i was rowed across a river\\nanswered he and got it there it lies on the shore instead of sand\\ncan i too fetch some of it said the king and he was quite eager\\nabout it as much as you like answered he there is a ferryman on\\nthe river let him ferry you over and you can fill your sacks on the\\nother side the greedy king set out in all haste and when he came to\\nthe river he beckoned to the ferryman to put him across the ferryman\\ncame and bade him get in and when they got to the other shore he put\\nthe oar in his hand and sprang out but from this time forth the king\\nhad to ferry as a punishment for his sins perhaps he is ferrying\\nstill if he is it is because no one has taken the oar from him',\n",

stepped up to him\\nwhom he had never seen before and said why dost thou plague thyself\\nwith cutting wood i will make thee rich if thou wilt promise me what\\nis standing behind thy mill what can that be but my appletree\\nthought the miller and said yes and gave a written promise to the\\nstranger he however laughed mockingly and said when three years\\nhave passed i will come and carry away what belongs to me and then\\nhe went when the miller got home his wife came to meet him and said\\ntell me miller from whence comes this sudden wealth into our house\\nall at once every box and chest was filled no one brought it in and i\\nknow not how it happened he answered it comes from a stranger who\\nmet me in the forest and promised me great treasure i in return\\nhave promised him what stands behind the mill we can very well give\\nhim the big appletree for it ah husband said the terrified wife\\nthat must have been the devil he did not mean the appletree but our\\ndaughter who was standing behind the mill sweeping the yard\\n\\nthe millers daughter was a beautiful pious girl and lived through\\nthe three years in the fear of god and without sin when therefore the\\ntime was over and the day came when the evilone was to fetch her she\\nwashed herself clean and made a circle round herself with chalk the\\ndevil appeared quite early but he could not come near to her angrily\\nhe said to the miller take all water away from her that she may no\\nlonger be able to wash herself for otherwise i have no power over\\nher the miller was afraid and did so the next morning the devil\\ncame again but she had wept on her hands and they were quite clean\\nagain he could not get near her and furiously said to the miller cut\\nher hands off or else i cannot get the better of her the miller was\\nshocked and answered how could i cut off my own childs hands then\\nthe evilone threatened him and said if thou dost not do it thou art\\nmine and i will take thee thyself the father became alarmed and\\npromised to obey him so he went to the girl and said my child if i\\ndo not cut off both thine hands the devil will carry me away and in\\nmy terror i have promised to do it help me in my need and forgive me\\nthe harm i do thee she replied dear father do with me what you\\nwill i am your child thereupon she laid down both her hands and let\\nthem be cut off the devil came for the third time but she had wept so\\nlong and so much on the stumps that after all they were quite clean\\nthen he had to give in and had lost all right over her\\n\\nthe miller said to her i have by means of thee received such great\\nwealth that i will keep thee most delicately as long as thou livest\\nbut she replied here i cannot stay i will go forth compassionate\\npeople will give me as much as i require thereupon she caused her\\nmaimed arms to be bound to her back and by sunrise she set out on her\\nway and walked the whole day until night fell then she came to a\\nroyal garden and by the shimmering of the moon she saw that trees\\ncovered with beautiful fruits grew in it but she could not enter for\\nthere was much water round about it and as she had walked the whole\\nday and not eaten one mouthful and hunger tormented her she thought\\nah if i were but inside that i might eat of the fruit else must i\\ndie of hunger then she knelt down called on god the lord and\\nprayed and suddenly an angel came towards her who made a dam in the\\nwater so that the moat became dry and she could walk through it and\\nnow she went into the garden and the angel went with her she saw a\\ntree covered with beautiful pears but they were all counted then she\\nwent to them and to still her hunger ate one with her mouth from the\\ntree but no more the gardener was watching but as the angel was\\nstanding by he was afraid and thought the maiden was a spirit and was\\nsilent neither did he dare to cry out or to speak to the spirit when\\nshe had eaten the pear she was satisfied and went and concealed\\nherself among the bushes the king to whom the garden belonged came\\ndown to it next morning and counted and saw that one of the pears was\\nmissing and asked the gardener what had become of it as it was not\\nlying beneath the tree but was gone then answered the gardener last\\nnight a spirit came in who had no hands and ate off one of the pears\\nwith its mouth the king said how did the spirit get over the water\\nand where did it go after it had eaten the pear the gardener\\nanswered some one came in a snowwhite garment from heaven who made a\\ndam and kept back the water that the spirit might walk through the\\nmoat and as it must have been an angel i was afraid and asked no\\nquestions and did not cry out when the spirit had eaten the pear it\\nwent back again the king said if it be as thou sayest i will watch\\nwith thee tonight\\n\\nwhen it grew dark the king came into the garden and brought a priest\\nwith him who was to speak to the spirit all three seated themselves\\nbeneath the tree and watched at midnight the maiden came creeping out\\nof the thicket went to the tree and again ate one pear off it with\\nher mouth and beside her stood the angel in white garments then the\\npriest went out to them and said comest thou from heaven or from\\nearth art thou a spirit or a human being she replied i am no\\nspirit but an unhappy mortal deserted by all but god the king said\\nif thou art forsaken by all the world yet will i not forsake thee\\nhe took her with him into his royal palace and as she was so beautiful\\nand good he loved her with all his heart had silver hands made for\\nher and took her to wife\\n\\nafter a year the king had to take the field so he commended his young\\nqueen to the care of his mother and said if she is brought to bed\\ntake care of her nurse her well and tell me of it at once in a\\nletter then she gave birth to a fine boy so the old mother made\\nhaste to write and announce the joyful news to him but the messenger\\nrested by a brook on the way and as he was fatigued by the great\\ndistance he fell asleep then came the devil who was always seeking\\nto injure the good queen and exchanged the letter for another in\\nwhich was written that the queen had brought a monster into the world\\nwhen the king read the letter he was shocked and much troubled but he\\nwrote in answer that they were to take great care of the queen and\\nnurse her well until his arrival the messenger went back with the\\nletter but rested at the same place and again fell asleep then came\\nthe devil once more and put a different letter in his pocket in which\\nit was written that they were to put the queen and her child to death\\nthe old mother was terribly shocked when she received the letter and\\ncould not believe it she wrote back again to the king but received no\\nother answer because each time the devil substituted a false letter\\nand in the last letter it was also written that she was to preserve the\\nqueens tongue and eyes as a token that she had obeyed\\n\\nbut the old mother wept to think such innocent blood was to be shed\\nand had a hind brought by night and cut out her tongue and eyes and\\nkept them then said she to the queen i cannot have thee killed as\\nthe king commands but here thou mayst stay no longer go forth into\\nthe wide world with thy child and never come here again the poor\\nwoman tied her child on her back and went away with eyes full of\\ntears she came into a great wild forest and then she fell on her\\nknees and prayed to god and the angel of the lord appeared to her and\\nled her to a little house on which was a sign with the words here all\\ndwell free a snowwhite maiden came out of the little house and said\\nwelcome lady queen and conducted her inside then they unbound the\\nlittle boy from her back and held him to her breast that he might\\nfeed and laid him in a beautifullymade little bed then said the poor\\nwoman from whence knowest thou that i was a queen the white maiden\\nanswered i am an angel sent by god to watch over thee and thy\\nchild the queen stayed seven years in the little house and was well\\ncared for and by gods grace because of her piety her hands which\\nhad been cut off grew once more\\n\\nat last the king came home again from the war and his first wish was\\nto see his wife and the child then his aged mother began to weep and\\nsaid thou wicked man why didst thou write to me that i was to take\\nthose two innocent lives and she showed him the two letters which the\\nevilone had forged and then continued i did as thou badest me and\\nshe showed the tokens the tongue and eyes then the king began to weep\\nfor his poor wife and his little son so much more bitterly than she was\\ndoing that the aged mother had compassion on him and said be at\\npeace she still lives i secretly caused a hind to be killed and took\\nthese tokens from it but i bound the child to thy wifes back and bade\\nher go forth into the wide world and made her promise never to come\\nback here again because thou wert so angry with her then spoke the\\nking i will go as far as the sky is blue and will neither eat nor\\ndrink until i have found again my dear wife and my child if in the\\nmeantime they have not been killed or died of hunger\\n\\nthereupon the king travelled about for seven long years and sought her\\nin every cleft of the rocks and in every cave but he found her not\\nand thought she had died of want during the whole of this time he\\nneither ate nor drank but god supported him at length he came into a\\ngreat forest and found therein the little house whose sign was here\\nall dwell free then forth came the white maiden took him by the\\nhand led him in and said welcome lord king and asked him from\\nwhence he came he answered soon shall i have travelled about for the\\nspace of seven years and i seek my wife and her child but cannot find\\nthem the angel offered him meat and drink but he did not take\\nanything and only wished to rest a little then he lay down to sleep\\nand put a handkerchief over his face\\n\\nthereupon the angel went into the chamber where the queen sat with her\\nson whom she usually called sorrowful and said to her go out with\\nthy child thy husband hath come so she went to the place where he\\nlay and the handkerchief fell from his face then said she\\nsorrowful pick up thy fathers handkerchief and cover his face\\nagain the child picked it up and put it over his face again the\\nking in his sleep heard what passed and had pleasure in letting the\\nhandkerchief fall once more but the child grew impatient and said\\ndear mother how can i cover my fathers face when i have no father in\\nthis world i have learnt to say the prayer our father which art in\\nheaven thou hast told me that my father was in heaven and was the\\ngood god and how can i know a wild man like this he is not my\\nfather when the king heard that he got up and asked who they were\\nthen said she i am thy wife and that is thy son sorrowful and he\\nsaw her living hands and said my wife had silver hands she\\nanswered the good god has caused my natural hands to grow again and\\nthe angel went into the inner room and brought the silver hands and\\nshowed them to him hereupon he knew for a certainty that it was his\\ndear wife and his dear child and he kissed them and was glad and\\nsaid a heavy stone has fallen from off mine heart then the angel of\\ngod gave them one meal with her and after that they went home to the\\nkings aged mother there

had apprenticed himself to a\\njoiner and learnt industriously and indefatigably and when the time\\ncame for him to go travelling his master presented him with a little\\ntable which had no particular appearance and was made of common wood\\nbut it had one good property if anyone set it out and said little\\ntable spread thyself the good little table was at once covered with\\na clean little cloth and a plate was there and a knife and fork\\nbeside it and dishes with boiled meats and roasted meats as many as\\nthere was room for and a great glass of red wine shone so that it made\\nthe heart glad the young journeyman thought with this thou hast\\nenough for thy whole life and went joyously about the world and never\\ntroubled himself at all whether an inn was good or bad or if anything\\nwas to be found in it or not when it suited him he did not enter an\\ninn at all but either on the plain in a wood a meadow or wherever\\nhe fancied he took his little table off his back set it down before\\nhim and said cover thyself and then everything appeared that his\\nheart desired at length he took it into his head to go back to his\\nfather whose anger would now be appeased and who would now willingly\\nreceive him with his wishingtable it came to pass that on his way\\nhome he came one evening to an inn which was filled with guests they\\nbade him welcome and invited him to sit and eat with them for\\notherwise he would have difficulty in getting anything no answered\\nthe joiner i will not take the few bites out of your mouths rather\\nthan that you shall be my guests they laughed and thought he was\\njesting with them he however placed his wooden table in the middle\\nof the room and said little table cover thyself instantly it was\\ncovered with food so good that the host could never have procured it\\nand the smell of it ascended pleasantly to the nostrils of the guests\\nfall to dear friends said the joiner and the guests when they saw\\nthat he meant it did not need to be asked twice but drew near pulled\\nout their knives and attacked it valiantly and what surprised them the\\nmost was that when a dish became empty a full one instantly took its\\nplace of its own accord the innkeeper stood in one corner and watched\\nthe affair he did not at all know what to say but thought thou\\ncouldst easily find a use for such a cook as that in thy kitchen the\\njoiner and his comrades made merry until late into the night at length\\nthey lay down to sleep and the young apprentice also went to bed and\\nset his magic table against the wall the hosts thoughts however let\\nhim have no rest it occurred to him that there was a little old table\\nin his lumberroom which looked just like the apprentices and he\\nbrought it out quite softly and exchanged it for the wishingtable\\nnext morning the joiner paid for his bed took up his table never\\nthinking that he had got a false one and went his way at midday he\\nreached his father who received him with great joy well my dear\\nson what hast thou learnt said he to him father i have become a\\njoiner\\n\\na good trade replied the old man but what hast thou brought back\\nwith thee from thy apprenticeship father the best thing which i\\nhave brought back with me is this little table the tailor inspected\\nit on all sides and said thou didst not make a masterpiece when thou\\nmadst that it is a bad old table but it is a table which furnishes\\nitself replied the son when i set it out and tell it to cover\\nitself the most beautiful dishes stand on it and a wine also which\\ngladdens the heart just invite all our relations and friends they\\nshall refresh and enjoy themselves for once for the table will give\\nthem all they require when the company was assembled he put his\\ntable in the middle of the room and said little table cover\\nthyself but the little table did not bestir itself and remained just\\nas bare as any other table which did not understand language then the\\npoor apprentice became aware that his table had been changed and was\\nashamed at having to stand there like a liar the relations however\\nmocked him and were forced to go home without having eaten or drunk\\nthe father brought out his patches again and went on tailoring but\\nthe son went to a master in the craft\\n\\nthe second son had gone to a miller and had apprenticed himself to him\\nwhen his years were over the master said as thou hast conducted\\nthyself so well i give thee an ass of a peculiar kind which neither\\ndraws a cart nor carries a sack to what use is he put then asked\\nthe young apprentice he lets gold drop from his mouth answered the\\nmiller if thou settest him on a cloth and sayest bricklebrit the\\ngood animal will drop gold pieces for thee that is a fine thing\\nsaid the apprentice and thanked the master and went out into the\\nworld when he had need of gold he had only to say bricklebrit to\\nhis ass and it rained gold pieces and he had nothing to do but pick\\nthem off the ground wheresoever he went the best of everything was\\ngood enough for him and the dearer the better for he had always a\\nfull purse when he had looked about the world for some time he\\nthought thou must seek out thy father if thou goest to him with the\\ngoldass he will forget his anger and receive thee well it came to\\npass that he came to the same publichouse in which his brothers table\\nhad been exchanged he led his ass by the bridle and the host was\\nabout to take the animal from him and tie him up but the young\\napprentice said dont trouble yourself i will take my grey horse\\ninto the stable and tie him up myself too for i must know where he\\nstands this struck the host as odd and he thought that a man who was\\nforced to look after his ass himself could not have much to spend but\\nwhen the stranger put his hand in his pocket and brought out two gold\\npieces and said he was to provide something good for him the host\\nopened his eyes wide and ran and sought out the best he could muster\\nafter dinner the guest asked what he owed the host did not see why he\\nshould not double the reckoning and said the apprentice must give two\\nmore gold pieces he felt in his pocket but his gold was just at an\\nend wait an instant sir host said he i will go and fetch some\\nmoney but he took the tablecloth with him the host could not\\nimagine what this could mean and being curious stole after him and\\nas the guest bolted the stabledoor he peeped through a hole left by a\\nknot in the wood the stranger spread out the cloth under the animal\\nand cried bricklebrit and immediately the beast began to let gold\\npieces fall so that it fairly rained down money on the ground eh my\\nword said the host ducats are quickly coined there a purse like\\nthat is not amiss the guest paid his score and went to bed but in\\nthe night the host stole down into the stable led away the master of\\nthe mint and tied up another ass in his place early next morning the\\napprentice travelled away with his ass and thought that he had his\\ngoldass at midday he reached his father who rejoiced to see him\\nagain and gladly took him in what hast thou made of thyself my\\nson asked the old man a miller dear father he answered what\\nhast thou brought back with thee from thy travels nothing else but\\nan ass there are asses enough here said the father i would\\nrather have had a good goat yes replied the son but it is no\\ncommon ass but a goldass when i say bricklebrit the good beast\\nopens its mouth and drops a whole sheetful of gold pieces just summon\\nall our relations hither and i will make them rich folks that suits\\nme well said the tailor for then i shall have no need to torment\\nmyself any longer with the needle and ran out himself and called the\\nrelations together as soon as they were assembled the miller bade\\nthem make way spread out his cloth and brought the ass into the room\\nnow watch said he and cried bricklebrit but no gold pieces\\nfell and it was clear that the animal knew nothing of the art for\\nevery ass does not attain such perfection then the poor miller pulled\\na long face saw that he was betrayed and begged pardon of the\\nrelatives who went home as poor as they came there was no help for\\nit the old man had to betake him to his needle once more and the\\nyouth hired himself to a miller\\n\\nthe third brother had apprenticed himself to a turner and as that is\\nskilled labour he was the longest in learning his brothers however\\ntold him in a letter how badly things had gone with them and how the\\ninnkeeper had cheated them of their beautiful wishinggifts on the last\\nevening before they reached home when the turner had served his time\\nand had to set out on his travels as he had conducted himself so well\\nhis master presented him with a sack and said there is a cudgel in\\nit i can put on the sack said he and it may be of good service\\nto me but why should the cudgel be in it it only makes it heavy i\\nwill tell thee why replied the master if any one has done anything\\nto injure thee do but say out of the sack cudgel and the cudgel\\nwill leap forth among the people and play such a dance on their backs\\nthat they will not be able to stir or move for a week and it will not\\nleave off until thou sayest into the sack cudgel the apprentice\\nthanked him and put the sack on his back and when any one came too\\nnear him and wished to attack him he said out of the sack cudgel\\nand instantly the cudgel sprang out and dusted the coat or jacket of\\none after the other on their backs and never stopped until it had\\nstripped it off them and it was done so quickly that before anyone\\nwas aware it was already his own turn in the evening the young turner\\nreached the inn where his brothers had been cheated he laid his sack\\non the table before him and began to talk of all the wonderful things\\nwhich he had seen in the world yes said he people may easily find\\na table which will cover itself a goldass and things of that\\nkind—extremely good things which i by no means despise—but these are\\nnothing in comparison with the treasure which i have won for myself\\nand am carrying about with me in my sack there the innkeeper pricked\\nup his ears what in the world can that be thought he the sack\\nmust be filled with nothing but jewels i ought to get them cheap too\\nfor all good things go in threes when it was time for sleep the\\nguest stretched himself on the bench and laid his sack beneath him for\\na pillow when the innkeeper thought his guest was lying in a sound\\nsleep he went to him and pushed and pulled quite gently and carefully\\nat the sack to see if he could possibly draw it away and lay another in\\nits place the turner had however been waiting for this for a long\\ntime and now just as the innkeeper was about to give a hearty tug he\\ncried out of the sack cudgel instantly the little cudgel came\\nforth and fell on the innkeeper and gave him a sound thrashing\\n\\nthe host cried for mercy but the louder he cried so much more heavily\\nthe cudgel beat the time on his back until at length he fell to the\\nground exhausted then the turner said if thou dost not give back the\\ntable which covers itself and the goldass the dance shall begin\\nafresh oh no cried the host quite humbly i will gladly produce\\neverything only make the accursed kobold creep back into the sack\\nthen said the apprentice i will let mercy take the place of justice\\nbut beware of getting into mischief again so he cried into the\\nsack cudgel and let him have rest\\n\\nnext morning the turner went home to his father with the wishingtable\\nand the goldass the tailor rejoiced when he saw him once more and\\nasked him likewise what he had learned in foreign parts dear father\\nsaid he i have become a turner a skilled trade said the father\\nwhat hast thou brought back with thee from thy travels\\n\\na precious thing dear father replied the son a cudgel in the\\nsack\\n\\nwhat cried the father a cudgel thats worth thy trouble indeed\\nfrom every tree thou can cut thyself one but not one like this dear\\nfather if i say out of the sack cudgel the cudgel springs out and\\nleads any one who means ill with me a weary dance and never stops\\nuntil he lies on the ground and prays for fair weather look you with\\nthis cudgel have i got back the wishingtable and the goldass which\\nthe thievish innkeeper took away from my brothers now let them both\\nbe sent for and invite all our kinsmen i will give them to eat and to\\ndrink and will fill their pockets with gold into the bargain the old\\ntailor would not quite believe but nevertheless got the relatives\\ntogether then the turner spread a cloth in the room and led in the\\ngoldass and said to his brother now dear brother speak to him\\nthe miller said bricklebrit and instantly the gold pieces fell down\\non the cloth like a thundershower and the ass did not stop until\\nevery one of them had so much that he could carry no more i can see\\nin thy face that thou also wouldst like to be there\\n\\nthen the turner brought the little table and said now dear brother\\nspeak to it and scarcely had the carpenter said table cover\\nthyself than it was spread and amply covered with the most exquisite\\ndishes then such a meal took place as the good tailor had never yet\\nknown in his house and the whole party of kinsmen stayed together till\\nfar in the night and were all merry and glad the tailor locked away\\nneedle and thread yardmeasure and goose in a press and lived with\\nhis three sons in joy and splendour what however has become of the\\ngoat who was to blame for the tailor driving out his three sons that i\\nwill tell thee she was ashamed that she had a bald head and ran to a\\nfoxs hole and crept into it when the fox came home he was met by two\\ngreat eyes shining out of the darkness and was terrified and ran away\\na bear met him and as the fox looked quite disturbed he said what\\nis the matter with thee brother fox why dost thou look like that\\nah answered redskin a fierce beast is in my cave and stared at me\\nwith its fiery eyes we will soon drive him out said the bear and\\nwent with him to the cave and looked in but when he saw the fiery\\neyes fear seized on him likewise he would have nothing to do with the\\nfurious beast and took to his heels the bee met him and as she saw\\nthat he was ill at ease she said bear thou art really pulling a\\nvery pitiful face what has become of all thy gaiety it is all very\\nwell for thee to talk replied the bear a furious beast with staring\\neyes is in redskins house and we cant drive him out the bee said\\nbear i pity thee i am a poor weak creature whom thou wouldst not turn\\naside to look at but still i believe i can help thee she flew into\\nthe foxs cave lighted on the goats smoothlyshorn head and stung\\nher so violently that she sprang up crying meh meh and ran forth\\ninto the world as if mad and to this hour no one knows where she has\\ngone',\n",
       " 'there was once a poor peasant who sat in the evening by the hearth and\\npoked the fire and his wife sat and span then said he how sad it is\\nthat we have no children with us all is so quiet and in other houses\\nit is noisy and lively\\n\\nyes replied the wife and sighed even if we had only one and it\\nwere quite small and only as big as a thumb i should be quite\\nsatisfied and we would still love it with all our hearts now it so\\nhappened that the woman fell ill and after seven months gave birth to\\na child that was perfect in all its limbs but no longer than a thumb\\nthen said they it is as we wished it to be and it shall be our dear\\nchild and because of its size they called it thumbling they did not\\nlet it want for food but the child did not grow taller but remained\\nas it had been at the first nevertheless it looked sensibly out of its\\neyes and soon showed itself to be a wise and nimble creature for\\neverything it did turned out well\\n\\none day the peasant was getting ready to go into the forest to cut\\nwood when he said as if to himself how i wish that there was any one\\nwho would bring the cart to me oh father cried thumbling i will\\nsoon bring the cart rely on that it shall be in the forest at the\\nappointed time the man smiled and said how can that be done thou\\nart far too small to lead the horse by the reins thats of no\\nconsequence father if my mother will only harness it i shall sit in\\nthe horses ear and call out to him how he is to go well answered\\nthe man for once we will try it\\n\\nwhen the time came the mother harnessed the horse and placed\\nthumbling in its ear and then the little creature cried gee up gee\\nup\\n\\nthen it went quite properly as if with its master and the cart went\\nthe right way into the forest it so happened that just as he was\\nturning a corner and the little one was crying gee up two strange\\nmen came towards him my word said one of them what is this there\\nis a cart coming and a driver is calling to the horse and still he is\\nnot to be seen that cant be right said the other we will follow\\nthe cart and see where it stops the cart however drove right into\\nthe forest and exactly to the place where the wood had been cut when\\nthumbling saw his father he cried to him seest thou father here i\\nam with the cart now take me down the father got hold of the horse\\nwith his left hand and with the right took his little son out of the\\near thumbling sat down quite merrily on a straw but when the two\\nstrange men saw him they did not know what to say for astonishment\\nthen one of them took the other aside and said hark the little\\nfellow would make our fortune if we exhibited him in a large town for\\nmoney we will buy him they went to the peasant and said sell us\\nthe little man he shall be well treated with us no replied the\\nfather he is the apple of my eye and all the money in the world\\ncannot buy him from me thumbling however when he heard of the\\nbargain had crept up the folds of his fathers coat placed himself on\\nhis shoulder and whispered in his ear father do give me away i will\\nsoon come back again then the father parted with him to the two men\\nfor a handsome bit of money where wilt thou sit they said to him\\noh just set me on the rim of your hat and then i can walk backwards\\nand forwards and look at the country and still not fall down they\\ndid as he wished and when thumbling had taken leave of his father\\nthey went away with him they walked until it was dusk and then the\\nlittle fellow said do take me down i want to come down the man\\ntook his hat off and put the little fellow on the ground by the\\nwayside and he leapt and crept about a little between the sods and\\nthen he suddenly slipped into a mousehole which he had sought out\\ngood evening gentlemen just go home without me he cried to them\\nand mocked them they ran thither and stuck their sticks into the\\nmousehole but it was all lost labour thumbling crept still farther\\nin and as it soon became quite dark they were forced to go home with\\ntheir vexation and their empty purses\\n\\nwhen thumbling saw that they were gone he crept back out of the\\nsubterranean passage it is so dangerous to walk on the ground in the\\ndark said he how easily a neck or a leg is broken fortunately he\\nknocked against an empty snailshell thank god said he in that i\\ncan pass the night in safety and got into it not long afterwards\\nwhen he was just going to sleep he heard two men go by and one of\\nthem was saying how shall we contrive to get hold of the rich\\npastors silver and gold i could tell thee that cried thumbling\\ninterrupting them what was that said one of the thieves in fright\\ni heard some one speaking they stood still listening and thumbling\\nspoke again and said take me with you and ill help you\\n\\nbut where art thou just look on the ground and observe from whence\\nmy voice comes he replied there the thieves at length found him and\\nlifted him up thou little imp how wilt thou help us they said a\\ngreat deal said he i will creep into the pastors room through the\\niron bars and will reach out to you whatever you want to have come\\nthen they said and we will see what thou canst do when they got\\nto the pastors house thumbling crept into the room but instantly\\ncried out with all his might do you want to have everything that is\\nhere the thieves were alarmed and said but do speak softly so as\\nnot to waken any one thumbling however behaved as if he had not\\nunderstood this and cried again what do you want do you want to\\nhave everything that is here the cook who slept in the next room\\nheard this and sat up in bed and listened the thieves however had\\nin their fright run some distance away but at last they took courage\\nand thought the little rascal wants to mock us they came back and\\nwhispered to him come be serious and reach something out to us\\nthen thumbling again cried as loudly as he could i really will give\\nyou everything just put your hands in the maid who was listening\\nheard this quite distinctly and jumped out of bed and rushed to the\\ndoor the thieves took flight and ran as if the wild huntsman were\\nbehind them but as the maid could not see anything she went to strike\\na light when she came to the place with it thumbling unperceived\\nbetook himself to the granary and the maid after she had examined\\nevery corner and found nothing lay down in her bed again and believed\\nthat after all she had only been dreaming with open eyes and ears\\n\\nthumbling had climbed up among the hay and found a beautiful place to\\nsleep in there he intended to rest until day and then go home again\\nto his parents but he had other things to go through truly there is\\nmuch affliction and misery in this world when day dawned the maid\\narose from her bed to feed the cows her first walk was into the barn\\nwhere she laid hold of an armful of hay and precisely that very one in\\nwhich poor thumbling was lying asleep he however was sleeping so\\nsoundly that he was aware of nothing and did not awake until he was in\\nthe mouth of the cow who had picked him up with the hay ah\\nheavens cried he how have i got into the fulling mill but he soon\\ndiscovered where he was then it was necessary to be careful not to let\\nhimself go between the teeth and be dismembered but he was\\nnevertheless forced to slip down into the stomach with the hay in\\nthis little room the windows are forgotten said he and no sun\\nshines in neither will a candle be brought his quarters were\\nespecially unpleasing to him and the worst was more and more hay was\\nalways coming in by the door and the space grew less and less then at\\nlength in his anguish he cried as loud as he could bring me no more\\nfodder bring me no more fodder the maid was just milking the cow\\nand when she heard some one speaking and saw no one and perceived\\nthat it was the same voice that she had heard in the night she was so\\nterrified that she slipped off her stool and spilt the milk she ran\\nin great haste to her master and said oh heavens pastor the cow\\nhas been speaking thou art mad replied the pastor but he went\\nhimself to the byre to see what was there hardly however had he set\\nhis foot inside when thumbling again cried bring me no more fodder\\nbring me no more fodder then the pastor himself was alarmed and\\nthought that an evil spirit had gone into the cow and ordered her to\\nbe killed she was killed but the stomach in which thumbling was was\\nthrown on the midden thumbling had great difficulty in working his\\nway however he succeeded so far as to get some room but just as he\\nwas going to thrust his head out a new misfortune occurred a hungry\\nwolf ran thither and swallowed the whole stomach at one gulp\\nthumbling did not lose courage perhaps thought he the wolf will\\nlisten to what i have got to say and he called to him from out of his\\nstomach dear wolf i know of a magnificent feast for you\\n\\nwhere is it to be had said the wolf\\n\\nin such and such a house thou must creep into it through the\\nkitchensink and wilt find cakes and bacon and sausages and as much\\nof them as thou canst eat and he described to him exactly his\\nfathers house the wolf did not require to be told this twice\\nsqueezed himself in at night through the sink and ate to his hearts\\ncontent in the larder when he had eaten his fill he wanted to go out\\nagain but he had become so big that he could not go out by the same\\nway thumbling had reckoned on this and now began to make a violent\\nnoise in the wolfs body and raged and screamed as loudly as he could\\nwilt thou be quiet said the wolf thou wilt waken up the people\\neh what replied the little fellow thou hast eaten thy fill and i\\nwill make merry likewise and began once more to scream with all his\\nstrength at last his father and mother were aroused by it and ran to\\nthe room and looked in through the opening in the door when they saw\\nthat a wolf was inside they ran away and the husband fetched his axe\\nand the wife the scythe stay behind said the man when they entered\\nthe room when i have given him a blow if he is not killed by it\\nthou must cut him down and hew his body to pieces then thumbling\\nheard his parents voices and cried dear father i am here i am in\\nthe wolfs body said the father full of joy thank god our dear\\nchild has found us again and bade the woman take away her scythe\\nthat thumbling might not be hurt with it after that he raised his arm\\nand struck the wolf such a blow on his head that he fell down dead and\\nthen they got knives and scissors and cut his body open and drew the\\nlittle fellow forth ah said the father what sorrow we have gone\\nthrough for thy sake yes father i have gone about the world a great\\ndeal thank heaven i breathe fresh air again where hast thou been\\nthen ah father i have been in a mouses hole in a cows stomach\\nand then in a wolfs now i will stay with you and we will not sell\\nthee again no not for all the riches in the world said his parents\\nand they embraced and kissed their dear thumbling they gave him to eat\\nand to drink and had some new clothes made for him for his own had\\nbeen

however just dished up and the dish\\nstood on the hearth then he said mother what is there to eat\\ntoday see for thyself said his mother so thumbling jumped on to\\nthe hearth and peeped into the

down to the ground again now the little tailor was\\noutside in the wide world and he travelled about and went to a master\\nin his craft but the food was not good enough for him mistress if\\nyou give us no better food said thumbling i will go away and early\\ntomorrow morning i will write with chalk on the door of your house\\ntoo many potatoes too little meat farewell mr potatoking

when they saw the little tailor they thought a little\\nfellow like that can creep through a keyhole and serve as picklock to\\nus hollo cried one of them thou giant goliath wilt thou go to\\nthe treasurechamber with us thou canst slip thyself in and throw out\\nthe money thumbling reflected a while and at length he said yes\\nand went with them to the treasurechamber then he looked at the doors\\nabove and below to see if there was any crack in them it was not long\\nbefore he espied one which was broad enough to let him in he was\\ntherefore about to get in at once but one of the two sentries who\\nstood before the door observed him and said to the other what an\\nugly spider is creeping there i will kill it let the poor creature\\nalone said the other it has done thee no harm then thumbling got\\nsafely through the crevice into the treasurechamber opened the window\\nbeneath which the robbers were standing and threw out to them one\\nthaler after another when the little tailor was in the full swing of\\nhis work he heard the king coming to inspect his treasurechamber and\\ncrept hastily into a hidingplace the king noticed that several solid\\nthalers were missing but could not conceive who could have stolen\\nthem for locks and bolts were in good condition and all seemed well\\nguarded then he went away again and said to the sentries be on the\\nwatch some one is after the money when therefore thumbling\\nrecommenced his labours they heard the money moving and a sound of\\nklink klink klink they ran swiftly in to seize the thief but the\\nlittle tailor who heard them coming was still swifter and leapt into\\na corner and covered himself with a thaler so that nothing could be\\nseen of him and at the same time he mocked the sentries and cried\\nhere am i the sentries ran thither but as they got there he had\\nalready hopped into another corner under a thaler and was crying ho\\nho here am i the watchmen sprang there in haste but thumbling had\\nlong

of the maids was mowing in the garden and saw thumbling\\njumping about and creeping up and down the plants she mowed him up\\nquickly with the grass tied all in a great cloth and secretly threw\\nit to the cows now amongst them there was a great black one who\\nswallowed him down without hurting him down below however it pleased\\nhim ill for it was quite dark neither was any candle burning

came into the cowbyre and said that cow\\nshall be killed tomorrow then thumbling was so alarmed that he cried\\nout in a clear voice let me out first for i am shut up inside her\\nthe master heard that quite well but did not know from whence the\\nvoice came where art thou asked he in the black one answered\\nthumbling but the master did not understand what that meant and went\\nout\\n\\nnext

with all\\nhis might dont chop too deep dont chop too deep i am amongst it\\nno one heard this because of the noise of the choppingknife now poor\\nthumbling was in trouble but trouble sharpens the

thrust into a blackpudding with\\nthe bits of bacon his quarters there were rather confined and besides\\nthat he was hung up in the chimney to be smoked and there time did\\nhang terribly heavy on

when he comes out of school and\\nwhen she saw from the window that he was coming it was just as if the\\ndevil entered into her and she snatched at the apple and took it away\\nagain from her daughter and said thou shalt not have one before thy\\nbrother then she threw the apple into the chest and shut it then\\nthe little boy came in at the door and the devil made her say to him\\nkindly my son wilt thou have an apple and she looked wickedly at\\nhim mother said the little boy how dreadful you look yes give\\nme an apple then it seemed to her as if she were forced to say to\\nhim come with me and she opened the lid of the chest and said\\ntake out an apple for thyself and while the little boy was stooping\\ninside the devil prompted her and crash she shut the lid down and\\nhis head flew off and fell among the red apples then she was\\noverwhelmed with terror and thought if i could but make them think\\nthat it was not done by me so she went upstairs to her room to her\\nchest of drawers and took a white handkerchief out of the top drawer\\nand set the head on the neck again and folded the handkerchief so that\\nnothing could be seen and she set him on a chair in front of the door\\nand put the apple in his hand\\n\\nafter this marlinchen came into the kitchen to her mother who was\\nstanding by the fire with a pan of hot water before her which she was\\nconstantly stirring round mother said marlinchen brother is\\nsitting at the door and he looks quite white and has an apple in his\\nhand i asked him to give me the apple but he did not answer me and i\\nwas quite frightened go back to him said her mother and if he\\nwill not answer thee give him a box on the ear so marlinchen went to\\nhim and said brother give me the apple but he was silent and she\\ngave him a box on the ear on which his head fell down marlinchen was\\nterrified and began crying and screaming and ran to her mother and\\nsaid alas mother i have knocked my brothers head off and she\\nwept and wept and could not be comforted marlinchen said the\\nmother what hast thou done but be quiet and let no one know it it\\ncannot be helped now we will make him into blackpuddings then the\\nmother took the little boy and chopped him in pieces put him into the\\npan and made him into black puddings but marlinchen stood by weeping\\nand weeping and all her tears fell into the pan and there was no need\\nof any salt\\n\\nthen the father came home and sat down to dinner and said but where\\nis my son and the mother served up a great dish of blackpuddings\\nand marlinchen wept and could not leave off then the father again\\nsaid but where is my son ah said the mother he has gone across\\nthe country to his mothers great uncle he will stay there awhile\\nand

lest\\nall should not be right he ought to have said goodbye to me with\\nthat he began to eat and said marlinchen why art thou crying thy\\nbrother will certainly come back then he said ah wife how\\ndelicious this food is give me some more and the more he ate the\\nmore he wanted to have and he said give me some more you shall have\\nnone of it it seems to me as if it were all mine and he ate and ate\\nand threw all the bones under the table until he had finished the\\nwhole but marlinchen went away to her chest of drawers and took her\\nbest silk handkerchief out of the bottom drawer and got all the bones\\nfrom beneath the table and tied them up in her silk handkerchief and\\ncarried them outside the door weeping tears of blood then the\\njunipertree began to stir itself and the branches parted asunder and\\nmoved together again just as if some one was rejoicing and clapping\\nhis hands at the same time a mist seemed to arise from the tree and\\nin the centre of this mist it burned like a fire and a beautiful bird\\nflew out of the fire singing magnificently and he flew high up in the\\nair and when he was gone the junipertree was just as it had been\\nbefore and the

       " 'once upon a time a certain king was hunting in a great forest and he\\nchased a wild beast so eagerly that none of his attendants could follow\\nhim when evening drew near he stopped and looked around him and then\\nhe saw that he had lost his way he sought a way out but could find\\nnone then he perceived an aged woman with a head which nodded\\nperpetually who came towards him but she was a witch good woman\\nsaid he to her can you not show me the way through the forest oh\\nyes lord king she answered that i certainly can but on one\\ncondition and if you do not fulfil that you will never get out of the\\nforest and will die of hunger in it\\n\\nwhat kind of condition is it asked the king\\n\\ni have a daughter said the old woman who is as beautiful as any\\none in the world and well deserves to be your consort and if you will\\nmake her your queen i will show you the way out of the forest in the\\nanguish of his heart the king consented and the old woman led him to\\nher little hut where her daughter was sitting by the fire she\\nreceived the king as if she had been expecting him and he saw that she\\nwas very beautiful but still she did not please him and he could not\\nlook at her without secret horror after he had taken the maiden up on\\nhis horse the old woman showed him the way and the king reached his\\nroyal palace again where the wedding was celebrated\\n\\nthe king had already been married once and had by his first wife\\nseven children six boys and a girl whom he loved better than anything\\nelse in the world as he now feared that the stepmother might not\\ntreat them well and even do them some injury he took them to a lonely\\ncastle which stood in the midst of a forest it lay so concealed and\\nthe way was so difficult to find that he himself would not have found\\nit if a wise woman had not given him a ball of yarn with wonderful\\nproperties when he threw it down before him it unrolled itself and\\nshowed him his path the king however went so frequently away to his\\ndear children that the queen observed his absence she was curious and\\nwanted to know what he did when he was quite alone in the forest she\\ngave a great deal of money to his servants and they betrayed the\\nsecret to her and told her likewise of the ball which alone could\\npoint out the way and now she knew no rest until she had learnt where\\nthe king kept the ball of yarn and then she made little shirts of\\nwhite silk and as she had learnt the art of witchcraft from her\\nmother she sewed a charm inside them and once when the king had\\nridden forth to hunt she took the little shirts and went into the\\nforest and the ball showed her the way the children who saw from a\\ndistance that some one was approaching thought that their dear father\\nwas coming to them and full of joy ran to meet him then she threw\\none of the little shirts over each of them and no sooner had the\\nshirts touched their bodies than they were changed into swans and flew\\naway over the forest the queen went home quite delighted and thought\\nshe had got rid of her stepchildren but the girl had not run out with\\nher brothers and the queen knew nothing about her next day the king\\nwent to visit his children but he found no one but the little girl\\nwhere are thy brothers asked the king alas dear father she\\nanswered they have gone away and left me alone and she told him\\nthat she had seen from her little window how her brothers had flown\\naway over the forest in the shape of swans and she showed him the\\nfeathers which they had let fall in the courtyard and which she had\\npicked up the king mourned but he did not think that the queen had\\ndone this wicked deed and as he feared that the girl would also be\\nstolen away from him he wanted to take her away with him but she was\\nafraid of her stepmother and entreated the king to let her stay just\\nthis one night more in the forest castle\\n\\nthe poor girl thought i can no longer stay here i will go and seek\\nmy brothers and when night came she ran away and went straight into\\nthe forest she walked the whole night long and next day also without\\nstopping until she could go no farther for weariness then she saw a\\nforesthut and went into it and found a room with six little beds\\nbut she did not venture to get into one of them but crept under one\\nand lay down on the hard ground intending to pass the night there\\njust before sunset however she heard a rustling and saw six swans\\ncome flying in at the window they alighted on the ground and blew at\\neach other and blew all the feathers off and their swans skins\\nstripped off like a shirt then the maiden looked at them and\\nrecognized her brothers was glad and crept forth from beneath the bed\\nthe brothers were not less delighted to see their little sister but\\ntheir joy was of short duration here canst thou not abide they said\\nto her this is a shelter for robbers if they come home and find\\nthee they will kill thee but can you not protect me asked the\\nlittle sister no they replied only for one quarter of an hour\\neach evening can we lay aside our swans skins and have during that\\ntime our human form after that we are once more turned into swans\\nthe little sister wept and said can you not be set free alas no\\nthey answered the conditions are too hard for six years thou mayst\\nneither speak nor laugh and in that time thou must sew together six\\nlittle shirts of starwort for us and if one single word falls from thy\\nlips all thy work will be lost and when the brothers had said this\\nthe quarter of an hour was over and they flew out of the window again\\nas swans\\n\\nthe maiden however firmly resolved to deliver her brothers even if\\nit should cost her her life she left the hut went into the midst of\\nthe forest seated herself on a tree and there passed the night next\\nmorning she went out and gathered starwort and began to sew she could\\nnot speak to any one and she had no inclination to laugh she sat\\nthere and looked at nothing but her work when she had already spent a\\nlong time there it came to pass that the king of the country was\\nhunting in the forest and his huntsmen came to the tree on which the\\nmaiden was sitting they called to her and said who art thou but\\nshe made no answer come down to us said they we will not do thee\\nany harm she only shook her head as they pressed her further with\\nquestions she threw her golden necklace down to them and thought to\\ncontent them thus they however did not cease and then she threw her\\ngirdle down to them and as this also was to no purpose her garters\\nand by degrees everything that she had on that she could do without\\nuntil she had nothing left but her shift the huntsmen however did\\nnot let themselves be turned aside by that but climbed the tree and\\nfetched the maiden down and led her before the king the king asked\\nwho art thou what art thou doing on the tree but she did not\\nanswer he put the question in every language that he knew but she\\nremained as mute as a fish as she was so beautiful the kings heart\\nwas touched and he was smitten with a great love for her he put his\\nmantle on her took her before him on his horse and carried her to his\\ncastle then he caused her to be dressed in rich garments and she\\nshone in her beauty like bright daylight but no word could be drawn\\nfrom her he placed her by his side at table and her modest bearing\\nand courtesy pleased him so much that he said she is the one whom i\\nwish to marry and no other woman in the world and after some days he\\nunited himself to her\\n\\nthe king however had a wicked mother who was dissatisfied with this\\nmarriage and spoke ill of the young queen who knows said she from\\nwhence the creature who cant speak comes she is not worthy of a\\nking after a year had passed when the queen brought her first child\\ninto the world the old woman took it away from her and smeared her\\nmouth with blood as she slept then she went to the king and accused\\nthe queen of being a maneater the king would not believe it and\\nwould not suffer any one to do her any injury she however sat\\ncontinually sewing at the shirts and cared for nothing else the next\\ntime when she again bore a beautiful boy the false stepmother used\\nthe same treachery but the king could not bring himself to give credit\\nto her words he said she is too pious and good to do anything of\\nthat kind if she were not dumb and could defend herself her\\ninnocence would come to light but when the old woman stole away the\\nnewlyborn child for the third time and accused the queen who did not\\nutter one word of defence the king could do no otherwise than deliver\\nher over to justice and she was sentenced to suffer death by fire\\n\\nwhen the day came for the sentence to be executed it was the last day\\nof the six years during which she was not to speak or laugh and she\\nhad delivered her dear brothers from the power of the enchantment the\\nsix shirts were ready only the left sleeve of the sixth was wanting\\nwhen therefore she was led to the stake she laid the shirts on her\\narm and when she stood on high and the fire was just going to be\\nlighted she looked around and six swans came flying through the air\\ntowards her then she saw that her deliverance was near and her heart\\nleapt with joy the swans swept towards her and sank down so that she\\ncould throw the shirts over them and as they were touched by them\\ntheir swans skins fell off and her brothers stood in their own bodily\\nform before her and were vigorous and handsome the youngest only\\nlacked his left arm and had in the place of it a swans wing on his\\nshoulder they embraced and kissed each other and the queen went to\\nthe king who was greatly moved and she began to speak and said\\ndearest husband now i may speak and declare to thee that i am\\ninnocent and falsely accused and she told him of the treachery of\\nthe old woman who had taken away her three children and hidden them\\nthen to the great joy of the king they were brought thither and as a\\npunishment the wicked stepmother was bound to the stake and burnt to\\nashes but the king and the queen with their six brothers lived many\\nyears in happiness and peace',\n",
       " 'a long time ago there were a king and queen who said every day ah if\\nonly we had a child but they never had one but it happened that once\\nwhen the queen was bathing a frog crept out of the water on to the\\nland and said to her your wish shall be fulfilled before a year has\\ngone by you shall have a daughter\\n\\nwhat the frog had said came true and the queen had a little girl who\\nwas so pretty that the king could not contain himself for joy and\\nordered a great feast he invited not only his kindred friends and\\nacquaintance but also the wise women in order that they might be kind\\nand welldisposed towards the child there were thirteen of them in his\\nkingdom but as he had only twelve golden plates for them to eat out\\nof one of them had to be left at home\\n\\nthe feast was held with all manner of splendour and when it came to an\\nend the wise women bestowed their magic gifts upon the baby one gave\\nvirtue another beauty a third riches and so on with everything in\\nthe world that one can wish for\\n\\nwhen eleven of them had made their promises suddenly the thirteenth\\ncame in she wished to avenge herself for not having been invited and\\nwithout greeting or even looking at any one she cried with a loud\\nvoice the kings daughter shall in her fifteenth year prick herself\\nwith a spindle and fall down dead and without saying a word more\\nshe turned round and left the room\\n\\nthey were all shocked but the twelfth whose good wish still remained\\nunspoken came forward and as she could not undo the evil sentence\\nbut only soften it she said it shall not be death but a deep sleep\\nof a hundred years into which the princess shall fall\\n\\nthe king who would fain keep his dear child from the misfortune gave\\norders that every spindle in the whole kingdom should be burnt\\nmeanwhile the gifts of the wise women were plenteously fulfilled on the\\nyoung girl for she was so beautiful modest goodnatured and wise\\nthat everyone who saw her was bound to love her\\n\\nit happened that on the very day when she was fifteen years old the\\nking and queen were not at home and the maiden was left in the palace\\nquite alone so she went round into all sorts of places looked into\\nrooms and bedchambers just as she liked and at last came to an old\\ntower she climbed up the narrow windingstaircase and reached a\\nlittle door a rusty key was in the lock and when she turned it the\\ndoor sprang open and there in a little room sat an old woman with a\\nspindle busily spinning her flax\\n\\ngood day old dame said the kings daughter what are you doing\\nthere i am spinning said the old woman and nodded her head what\\nsort of thing is that that rattles round so merrily said the girl\\nand she took the spindle and wanted to spin too but scarcely had she\\ntouched the spindle when the magic decree was fulfilled and she\\npricked her finger with it\\n\\nand in the very moment when she felt the prick she fell down upon the\\nbed that stood there and lay in a deep sleep and this sleep extended\\nover the whole palace the king and queen who had just come home and\\nhad entered the great hall began to go to sleep and the whole of the\\ncourt with them the horses too went to sleep in the stable the dogs\\nin the yard the pigeons upon the roof the flies on the wall even the\\nfire that was flaming on the hearth became quiet and slept the roast\\nmeat left off frizzling and the cook who was just going to pull the\\nhair of the scullery boy because he had forgotten something let him\\ngo and went to sleep and the wind fell and on the trees before the\\ncastle not a leaf moved again\\n\\nbut round about the castle there began to grow a hedge of thorns which\\nevery year became higher and at last grew close up round the castle\\nand all over it so that there was nothing of it to be seen not even\\nthe flag upon the roof but the story of the beautiful sleeping\\nbriarrose for so the princess was named went about the country so\\nthat from time to time kings sons came and tried to get through the\\nthorny hedge into the castle\\n\\nbut they found it impossible for the thorns held fast together as if\\nthey had hands and the youths were caught in them could not get loose\\nagain and died a miserable death\\n\\nafter long long years a kings son came again to that country and\\nheard an old man talking about the thornhedge and that a castle was\\nsaid to stand behind it in which a wonderfully beautiful princess\\nnamed briarrose had been asleep for a hundred years and that the\\nking and queen and the whole court were asleep likewise he had heard\\ntoo from his grandfather that many kings sons had already come and\\nhad tried to get through the thorny hedge but they had remained\\nsticking fast in it and had died a pitiful death then the youth said\\ni am not afraid i will go and see the beautiful briarrose the good\\nold man might dissuade him as he would he did not listen to his words\\n\\nbut by this time the hundred years had just passed and the day had\\ncome when briarrose was to awake again when the kings son came near\\nto the thornhedge it was nothing but large and beautiful flowers\\nwhich parted from each other of their own accord and let him pass\\nunhurt then they closed again behind him like a hedge in the\\ncastleyard he saw the

door into\\nthe little room where briarrose was sleeping there she lay so\\nbeautiful that he could not turn his eyes away and he stooped down and\\ngave her a kiss but as soon as he kissed her

looked round and flew into the\\nopen country the flies on the wall crept again the fire in the\\nkitchen burned up and flickered and cooked the meat the joint began to\\nturn and frizzle again and

       " 'there was once a forester who went into the forest to hunt and as he\\nentered it he heard a sound of screaming as if a little child were\\nthere he followed the sound and at last came to a high tree and at\\nthe top of this a little child was sitting for the mother had fallen\\nasleep under the tree with the child and a bird of prey had seen it in\\nher arms had flown down snatched it away and set it on the high\\ntree\\n\\nthe forester climbed up brought the child down and thought to\\nhimself thou wilt take him home with thee and bring him up with thy\\nlina he took it home therefore and the two children grew up\\ntogether the one however which he had found on a tree was called\\nfundevogel because a bird had carried it away fundevogel and lina\\nloved each other so dearly that when they did not see each other they\\nwere sad\\n\\nthe forester however had an old cook who one evening took two pails\\nand began to fetch water and did not go once only but many times out\\nto the spring lina saw this and said hark you old sanna why are\\nyou fetching so much water if thou wilt never repeat it to anyone i\\nwill tell thee why so lina said no she would never repeat it to\\nanyone and then the cook said early tomorrow morning when the\\nforester is out hunting i will heat the water and when it is boiling\\nin the kettle i will throw in fundevogel and will boil him in it\\n\\nbetimes next morning the forester got up and went out hunting and when\\nhe was gone the children were still in bed then lina said to\\nfundevogel if thou wilt never leave me i too will never leave thee\\nfundevogel said neither now nor ever will i leave thee then said\\nlina then i will tell thee last night old sanna carried so many\\nbuckets of water into the house that i asked her why she was doing\\nthat and she said that if i would promise not to tell any one she\\nwould tell me and i said i would be sure not to tell any one and she\\nsaid that early tomorrow morning when father was out hunting she\\nwould set the kettle full of water throw thee into it and boil thee\\nbut we will get up quickly dress ourselves and go away together\\n\\nthe two children therefore got up dressed themselves quickly and went\\naway when the water in the kettle was boiling the cook went into the\\nbedroom to fetch fundevogel and throw him into it but when she came\\nin and went to the beds both the children were gone then she was\\nterribly alarmed and she said to herself what shall i say now when\\nthe forester comes home and sees that the children are gone they must\\nbe followed instantly to get them back again\\n\\nthen the cook sent three servants after them who were to run and\\novertake the children the children however were sitting outside the\\nforest and when they saw from afar the three servants running lina\\nsaid to fundevogel never leave me and i will never leave thee\\nfundevogel said neither now nor ever then said lina do thou\\nbecome a rosetree and i the rose upon it when the three servants\\ncame to the forest nothing was there but a rosetree and one rose on\\nit but the children were nowhere then said they there is nothing to\\nbe done here and they went home and told the cook that they had seen\\nnothing in the forest but a little rosebush with one rose on it then\\nthe old cook scolded and said you simpletons you should have cut the\\nrosebush in two and have broken off the rose and brought it home with\\nyou go and do it once they had therefore to go out and look for the\\nsecond time the children however saw them coming from a distance\\nthen lina said fundevogel never leave me and i will never leave\\nthee fundevogel said neither now nor ever said lina then do\\nthou become a church and ill be the chandelier in it so when the\\nthree servants came nothing was there but a church with a chandelier\\nin it they said therefore to each other what can we do here let us\\ngo home when they got home the cook asked if they had not found\\nthem so they said no they had found nothing but a church and that\\nthere was a chandelier in it and the cook scolded them and said you\\nfools why did you not pull the church to pieces and bring the\\nchandelier home with you and now the old cook herself got on her\\nlegs and went with the three servants in pursuit of the children the\\nchildren however saw from afar that the three servants were coming\\nand the cook waddling after them then said lina fundevogel never\\nleave me and i will never leave thee then said fundevogel neither\\nnow nor ever said lina be a fishpond and i will be the duck upon\\nit the cook however came up to them and when she saw the pond she\\nlay down by it and was about to drink it up but the duck swam quickly\\nto her seized her head in its beak and drew her into the water and\\nthere the old witch had to drown then the children went home together\\nand were heartily delighted and if they are not dead they are living\\nstill',\n",

       " 'once upon a time in the middle of winter when the flakes of snow were\\nfalling like feathers from the sky a queen sat at a window sewing and\\nthe frame of the window was made of black ebony and whilst she was\\nsewing and looking out of the window at the snow she pricked her\\nfinger with the needle and three drops of blood fell upon the snow\\nand the red looked pretty upon the white snow and she thought to\\nherself would that i had a child as white as snow as red as blood\\nand as black as the wood of the windowframe\\n\\nsoon after that she had a little daughter who was as white as snow\\nand as red as blood and her hair was as black as ebony and she was\\ntherefore called little snowwhite and when the child was born the\\nqueen died\\n\\nafter a year had passed the king took to himself another wife she was\\na beautiful woman but proud and haughty and she could not bear that\\nanyone else should surpass her in beauty she had a wonderful\\nlookingglass and when she stood in front of it and looked at herself\\nin it and said—\\n\\nlookingglass lookingglass on the wall\\nwho in this land is the fairest of all\\n\\n\\nthe lookingglass answered—\\n\\nthou o queen art the fairest of all\\n\\n\\nthen she was satisfied for she knew that the lookingglass spoke the\\ntruth\\n\\nbut snowwhite was growing up and grew more and more beautiful and\\nwhen she was seven years old she was as beautiful as the day and more\\nbeautiful than the queen herself and once when the queen asked her\\nlookingglass—\\n\\nlookingglass lookingglass on the wall\\nwho in this land is the fairest of all\\n\\n\\nit answered—\\n\\nthou art fairer than all who are here lady queen\\nbut more beautiful still is snowwhite as i ween\\n\\n\\nthen the queen was shocked and turned yellow and green with envy from\\nthat hour whenever she looked at snowwhite her heart heaved in her\\nbreast she hated the girl so much\\n\\nand envy and pride grew higher and higher in her heart like a weed so\\nthat she had no peace day or night she called a huntsman and said\\ntake the child away into the forest i will no longer have her in my\\nsight kill her and bring me back her heart as a token the huntsman\\nobeyed and took her away but when he had drawn his knife and was\\nabout to pierce snowwhites innocent heart she began to weep and\\nsaid ah dear huntsman leave me my life i will run away into the\\nwild forest and never come home again\\n\\nand as she was so beautiful the huntsman had pity on her and said run\\naway then you poor child the wild beasts will soon have devoured\\nyou thought he and yet it seemed as if a stone had been rolled from\\nhis heart since it was no longer needful for him to kill her and as a\\nyoung boar just then came running by he stabbed it and cut out its\\nheart and took it to the queen as proof that the child was dead the\\ncook had to salt this and the wicked queen ate it and thought she had\\neaten the heart of snowwhite\\n\\nbut now the poor child was all alone in the great forest and so\\nterrified that she looked at every leaf of every tree and did not know\\nwhat to do then she began to run and ran over sharp stones and\\nthrough thorns and the wild beasts ran past her but did her no harm\\n\\nshe ran as long as her feet would go until it was almost evening then\\nshe saw a little cottage and went into it to rest herself everything\\nin the cottage was small but neater and cleaner than can be told\\nthere was a table on which was a white cover and seven little plates\\nand on each plate a little spoon moreover there were seven little\\nknives and forks and seven little mugs against the wall stood seven\\nlittle beds side by side and covered with snowwhite counterpanes\\n\\nlittle snowwhite was so hungry and thirsty that she ate some\\nvegetables and bread from each plate and drank a drop of wine out of\\neach mug for she did not wish to take all from one only then as she\\nwas so tired she laid herself down on one of the little beds but none\\nof them suited her one was too long another too short but at last\\nshe found that the seventh one was right and so she remained in it\\nsaid a prayer and went to sleep\\n\\nwhen it was quite dark the owners of the cottage came back they were\\nseven dwarfs who dug and delved in the mountains for ore they lit\\ntheir seven candles and as it was now light within the cottage they\\nsaw that someone had been there for everything was not in the same\\norder in which they had left it\\n\\nthe first said who has been sitting on my chair\\n\\nthe second who has been eating off my plate\\n\\nthe third who has been taking some of my bread\\n\\nthe fourth who has been eating my vegetables\\n\\nthe fifth who has been using my fork\\n\\nthe sixth who has been cutting with my knife\\n\\nthe seventh who has been drinking out of my mug\\n\\nthen the first looked round and saw that there was a little hole on his\\nbed and he said who has been getting into my bed the others came\\nup and each called out somebody has been lying in my bed too but\\nthe seventh when he looked at his bed saw little snowwhite who was\\nlying asleep therein and he called the others who came running up\\nand they cried out with astonishment and brought their seven little\\ncandles and let the light fall on little snowwhite oh heavens oh\\nheavens cried they what a lovely child and they were so glad that\\nthey did not wake her up but let her sleep on in the bed and the\\nseventh dwarf slept with his companions one hour with each and so got\\nthrough the night\\n\\nwhen it was morning little snowwhite awoke and was frightened when\\nshe saw the seven dwarfs but they were friendly and asked her what her\\nname was my name is snowwhite she answered how have you come to\\nour house said the dwarfs then she told them that her stepmother\\nhad wished to have her killed but that the huntsman had spared her\\nlife and that she had run for the whole day until at last she had\\nfound their dwelling the dwarfs said if you will take care of our\\nhouse cook make the beds wash sew and knit and if you will keep\\neverything neat and clean you can stay with us and you shall want for\\nnothing yes said snowwhite with all my heart and she stayed\\nwith them she kept the house in order for them in the mornings they\\nwent to the mountains and looked for copper and gold in the evenings\\nthey came back and then their supper had to be ready the girl was\\nalone the whole day so the good dwarfs warned her and said beware of\\nyour stepmother she will soon know that you are here be sure to let\\nno one come in\\n\\nbut the queen believing that she had eaten snowwhites heart could\\nnot but think that she was again the first and most beautiful of all\\nand she went to her lookingglass and said—\\n\\nlookingglass lookingglass on the wall\\nwho in this land is the fairest of all\\n\\n\\nand the glass answered—\\n\\noh queen thou art fairest of all i see\\nbut over the hills where the seven dwarfs dwell\\nsnowwhite is still alive and well\\nand none is so fair as she\\n\\n\\nthen she was astounded for she knew that the lookingglass never spoke\\nfalsely and she knew that the huntsman had betrayed her and that\\nlittle snowwhite was still alive\\n\\nand so she thought and thought again how she might kill her for so\\nlong as she was not the fairest in the whole land envy let her have no\\nrest and when she had at last thought of something to do she painted\\nher face and dressed herself like an old peddlerwoman and no one\\ncould have known her in this disguise she went over the seven\\nmountains to the seven dwarfs and knocked at the door and cried\\npretty things to sell very cheap very cheap little snowwhite\\nlooked out of the window and called out goodday my good woman what\\nhave you to sell good things pretty things she answered\\nstaylaces of all colours and she pulled out one which was woven of\\nbrightcoloured silk i may let the worthy old woman in thought\\nsnowwhite and she unbolted the door and bought the pretty laces\\nchild said the old woman what a fright you look come i will lace\\nyou properly for once snowwhite had no suspicion but stood before\\nher and let herself be laced with the new laces but the old woman\\nlaced so quickly and so tightly that snowwhite lost her breath and\\nfell down as if dead now i am the most beautiful said the queen to\\nherself and ran away\\n\\nnot long afterwards in the evening the seven dwarfs came home but\\nhow shocked they were when they saw their dear little snowwhite lying\\non the ground and that she neither stirred nor moved and seemed to be\\ndead they lifted her up and as they saw that she was laced too\\ntightly they cut the laces then she began to breathe a little and\\nafter a while came to life again when the dwarfs heard what had\\nhappened they said the old peddlerwoman was no one else than the\\nwicked queen take care and let no one come in when we are not with\\nyou\\n\\nbut the wicked woman when she had reached home went in front of the\\nglass and asked—\\n\\nlookingglass lookingglass on the wall\\nwho in this land is the fairest of all\\n\\n\\nand it answered as before—\\n\\noh queen thou art fairest of all i see\\nbut over the hills where the seven dwarfs dwell\\nsnowwhite is still alive and well\\nand none is so fair as she\\n\\n\\nwhen she heard that all her blood rushed to her heart with fear for\\nshe saw plainly that little snowwhite was again alive but now she\\nsaid i will think of something that shall put an end to you and by\\nthe help of witchcraft which she understood she made a poisonous\\ncomb then she disguised herself and took the shape of another old\\nwoman so she went over the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs\\nknocked at the door and cried good things to sell cheap cheap\\nlittle snowwhite looked out and said go away i cannot let any one\\ncome in i suppose you can look said the old woman and pulled the\\npoisonous comb out and held it up it pleased the girl so well that she\\nlet herself be beguiled and opened the door when they had made a\\nbargain the old woman said now i will comb you properly for once\\npoor little snowwhite had no suspicion and let the old woman do as\\nshe pleased but hardly had she put the comb in her hair than the\\npoison in it took effect and the girl fell down senseless you\\nparagon of beauty said the wicked woman you are done for now and\\nshe went away\\n\\nbut fortunately it was almost evening when the seven dwarfs came home\\nwhen they saw snowwhite lying as if dead upon the ground they at once\\nsuspected the stepmother and they looked and found the poisoned comb\\nscarcely had they taken it out when snowwhite came to herself and\\ntold them what had happened then they warned her once more to be upon\\nher guard and to open the door to no one\\n\\nthe queen at home went in front of the glass and said—\\n\\nlookingglass lookingglass on the wall\\nwho in this land is the fairest of all\\n\\n\\nthen it answered as before—\\n\\noh queen thou art fairest of all i see\\nbut over the hills where the seven dwarfs dwell\\nsnowwhite is still alive and well\\nand none is so fair as she\\n\\n\\nwhen she heard the glass speak thus she trembled and shook with rage\\nsnowwhite shall die she cried even if it costs me my life\\n\\nthereupon she went into a quite secret lonely room where no one ever\\ncame and there she made a very poisonous apple outside it looked\\npretty white with a red cheek so that everyone who saw it longed for\\nit but whoever ate a piece of it must surely die\\n\\nwhen the apple was ready she painted her face and dressed herself up\\nas a countrywoman and so she went over the seven mountains to the\\nseven dwarfs she knocked at the door snowwhite put her head out of\\nthe window and said i cannot let any one in the seven dwarfs have\\nforbidden me it is all the same to me answered the woman i shall\\nsoon get rid of my apples there i will give you one\\n\\nno said snowwhite i dare not take anything are you afraid of\\npoison said the old woman look i will cut the apple in two pieces\\nyou eat the red cheek and i will eat the white the apple was so\\ncunningly made that only the red cheek was poisoned snowwhite longed\\nfor the fine apple and when she saw that the woman ate part of it she\\ncould resist no longer and stretched out her hand and took the\\npoisonous half but hardly had she a bit of it in her mouth than she\\nfell down dead then the queen looked at her with a dreadful look and\\nlaughed aloud and said white as snow red as blood black as\\nebonywood this time the dwarfs cannot wake you up again\\n\\nand when she asked of the lookingglass at home—\\n\\nlookingglass lookingglass on the wall\\nwho in this land is the fairest of all\\n\\n\\nit answered at last—\\n\\noh queen in this land thou art fairest of all\\n\\n\\nthen her envious heart had rest so far as an envious heart can have\\nrest\\n\\nthe dwarfs when they came home in the evening found snowwhite lying\\nupon the ground she breathed no longer and was dead they lifted her\\nup looked to see whether they could find anything poisonous unlaced\\nher combed her hair washed her with water and wine but it was all of\\nno use the poor child was dead and remained dead they laid her upon\\na bier and all seven of them sat round it and wept for her and wept\\nthree days long\\n\\nthen they were going to bury her but she still looked as if she were\\nliving and still had her pretty red cheeks they said we could not\\nbury her in the dark ground and they had a transparent coffin of\\nglass made so that she could be seen from all sides and they laid her\\nin it and wrote her name upon it in golden letters and that she was a\\nkings daughter then they put the coffin out upon the mountain and\\none of them always stayed by it and watched it and birds came too and\\nwept for snowwhite first an owl then a raven and last a dove\\n\\nand now snowwhite lay a long long time in the coffin and she did not\\nchange but looked as if she were asleep for she was as white as snow\\nas red as blood and her hair was as black as ebony\\n\\nit happened however that a kings son came into the forest and went\\nto the dwarfs house to spend the night he saw the coffin on the\\nmountain and the beautiful snowwhite within it and read what was\\nwritten upon it in golden letters then he said to the dwarfs let me\\nhave the coffin i will give you whatever you want for it but the\\ndwarfs answered we will not part with it for all the gold in the\\nworld then he said let me have it as a gift for i cannot live\\nwithout seeing snowwhite i will honour and prize her as my dearest\\npossession as he spoke in this way the good dwarfs took pity upon\\nhim and gave him the coffin\\n\\nand now the kings son had it carried away by his servants on their\\nshoulders and it happened that they stumbled over a treestump and\\nwith the shock the poisonous piece of apple which snowwhite had bitten\\noff came out of her throat and before long she opened her eyes lifted\\nup the lid of the coffin sat up and was once more alive oh\\nheavens where am i she cried the kings son full of joy said\\nyou are with me and told her what had happened and said i love\\nyou more than everything in the world come with me to my fathers\\npalace you shall be my wife\\n\\nand snowwhite was willing and went with him and their wedding was\\nheld with great show and splendour but snowwhites wicked stepmother\\nwas also bidden to the feast when she had arrayed herself in beautiful\\nclothes she went before the lookingglass and said—\\n\\nlookingglass lookingglass on the wall\\nwho in this land is the fairest of all\\n\\n\\nthe glass answered—\\n\\noh queen of all here the fairest art thou\\nbut the young queen is fairer by far as i trow\\n\\n\\nthen the wicked woman uttered a curse and was so wretched so utterly\\nwretched that she knew not what to do at first she would not go to\\nthe wedding at all but she had no peace and must go to see the young\\nqueen and when she went in she knew snowwhite and she stood still\\nwith rage and fear and could not stir but iron slippers had already\\nbeen put upon the fire and they were brought in with tongs and set\\nbefore her then she was forced to put on the redhot shoes and dance\\nuntil she dropped down dead',\n",
       " 'there were once three brothers who had fallen deeper and deeper into\\npoverty and at last their need was so great that they had to endure\\nhunger and had nothing to eat or drink then said they we cannot go\\non thus we had better go into the world and seek our fortune they\\ntherefore set out and had already walked over many a long road and\\nmany a blade of grass but had not yet met with good luck one day they\\narrived in a great forest and in the midst of it was a hill and when\\nthey came nearer they saw that the hill was all silver then spoke the\\neldest now i have found the good luck i wished for and i desire\\nnothing more he took as much of the silver as he could possibly\\ncarry and then turned back and went home again but the two others\\nsaid we want something more from good luck than mere silver and did\\nnot touch it but went onwards after they had walked for two days\\nlonger without stopping they came to a hill which was all gold the\\nsecond brother stopped took thought with himself and was undecided\\nwhat shall i do said he shall i take for myself so much of this\\ngold that i have sufficient for all the rest of my life or shall i go\\nfarther at length he made a decision and putting as much into his\\npockets as would go in said farewell to his brother and went home\\nbut the third said silver and gold do not move me i will not\\nrenounce my chance of fortune perhaps something better still will be\\ngiven me he journeyed onwards and when he had walked for three days\\nhe got into a forest which was still larger than the one before and\\nnever would come to an end and as he found nothing to eat or to drink\\nhe was all but exhausted then he climbed up a high tree to find out if\\nup there he could see the end of the forest but so far as his eye\\ncould pierce he saw nothing but the tops of trees then he began to\\ndescend the tree again but hunger tormented him and he thought to\\nhimself if i could but eat my fill once more when he got down he\\nsaw with astonishment a table beneath the tree richly spread with food\\nthe steam of which rose up to meet him this time said he my wish\\nhas been fulfilled at the right moment and without inquiring who had\\nbrought the food or who had cooked it he approached the table and\\nate with enjoyment until he had appeased his hunger when he was done\\nhe thought it would after all be a pity if the pretty little\\ntablecloth were to be spoilt in the forest here and folded it up\\ntidily and put it in his pocket then he went onwards and in the\\nevening when hunger once more made itself felt he wanted to make a\\ntrial of his little cloth and spread it out and said i wish thee to\\nbe covered with good cheer again and scarcely had the wish crossed\\nhis lips than as many dishes with the most exquisite food on them stood\\non the table as there was room for now i perceive said he in what\\nkitchen my cooking is done thou shalt be dearer to me than the\\nmountains of silver and gold for he saw plainly that it was a\\nwishingcloth the cloth however was still not enough to enable him\\nto sit down quietly at home he preferred to wander about the world and\\npursue his fortune farther\\n\\none night he met in a lonely wood a dusty black charcoalburner who\\nwas burning charcoal there and had some potatoes by the fire on which\\nhe was going to make a meal good evening blackbird said the youth\\nhow dost thou get on in thy solitude\\n\\none day is like another replied the charcoalburner and every\\nnight potatoes hast thou a mind to have some and wilt thou be my\\nguest many thanks replied the traveler i wont rob thee of thy\\nsupper thou didst not reckon on a visitor but if thou wilt put up\\nwith what i have thou shalt have an invitation\\n\\nwho is to prepare it for thee said the charcoalburner i see that\\nthou hast nothing with thee and there is no one within a two hours\\nwalk who could give thee anything and yet there shall be a meal\\nanswered the youth and better than any thou hast ever tasted\\nthereupon he brought his cloth out of his knapsack spread it on the\\nground and said little cloth cover thyself and instantly boiled\\nmeat and baked meat stood there and as hot as if it had just come out\\nof the kitchen the charcoalburner stared but did not require much\\npressing he fell to and thrust larger and larger mouthfuls into his\\nblack mouth when they had eaten everything the charcoalburner smiled\\ncontentedly and said hark thee thy tablecloth has my approval it\\nwould be a fine thing for me in this forest where no one ever cooks me\\nanything good i will propose an exchange to thee there in the corner\\nhangs a soldiers knapsack which is certainly old and shabby but in\\nit lie concealed wonderful powers but as i no longer use it i will\\ngive it to thee for the tablecloth\\n\\ni must first know what these wonderful powers are answered the\\nyouth\\n\\nthat will i tell thee replied the charcoalburner every time thou\\ntappest it with thy hand a corporal comes with six men armed from head\\nto foot and they do whatsoever thou commandest them so far as i am\\nconcerned said the youth if nothing else can be done we will\\nexchange and he gave the charcoalburner the cloth took the knapsack\\nfrom the hook put it on and bade farewell when he had walked a\\nwhile he wished to make a trial of the magical powers of his knapsack\\nand tapped it immediately the seven warriors stepped up to him and\\nthe corporal said what does my lord and ruler wish for\\n\\nmarch with all speed to the charcoalburner and demand my\\nwishingcloth back they faced to the left and it was not long before\\nthey brought what he required and had taken it from the\\ncharcoalburner without asking many questions the young man bade them\\nretire went onwards and hoped fortune would shine yet more brightly\\non him by sunset he came to another charcoalburner who was making\\nhis supper ready by the fire if thou wilt eat some potatoes with\\nsalt but with no dripping come and sit down with me said the sooty\\nfellow\\n\\nno he replied this time thou shalt be my guest and he spread out\\nhis cloth which was instantly covered with the most beautiful dishes\\nthey ate and drank together and enjoyed themselves heartily after the\\nmeal was over the charcoalburner said up there on that shelf lies a\\nlittle old wornout hat which has strange properties when any one puts\\nit on and turns it round on his head the cannons go off as if twelve\\nwere fired all together and they shoot down everything so that no one\\ncan withstand them the hat is of no use to me and i will willingly\\ngive it for thy tablecloth\\n\\nthat suits me very well he answered took the hat put it on and\\nleft his tablecloth behind him hardly however had he walked away\\nthan he tapped on his knapsack and his soldiers had to fetch the cloth\\nback again one thing comes on the top of another thought he and i\\nfeel as if my luck had not yet come to an end neither had his\\nthoughts deceived him after he had walked on for the whole of one day\\nhe came to a third charcoalburner who like the previous ones invited\\nhim to potatoes without dripping but he let him also dine with him\\nfrom his wishingcloth and the charcoalburner liked it so well that\\nat last he offered him a horn for it which had very different\\nproperties from those of the hat when any one blew it all the walls\\nand fortifications fell down and all towns and villages became ruins\\nhe certainly gave the charcoalburner the cloth for it but he\\nafterwards sent his soldiers to demand it back again so that at length\\nhe had the knapsack hat and horn all three now said he i am a\\nmade man and it is time for me to go home and see how my brothers are\\ngetting on\\n\\nwhen he reached home his brothers had built themselves a handsome\\nhouse with their silver and gold and were living in clover he went to\\nsee them but as he came in a ragged coat with his shabby hat on his\\nhead and his old knapsack on his back they would not acknowledge him\\nas their brother they mocked and said thou givest out that thou art\\nour brother who despised silver and gold and craved for something\\nstill better for himself he will come in his carriage in full\\nsplendour like a mighty king not like a beggar and they drove him\\nout of doors then he fell into a rage and tapped his knapsack until a\\nhundred and fifty men stood before him armed from head to foot he\\ncommanded them to surround his brothers house and two of them were to\\ntake hazelsticks with them and beat the two insolent men until they\\nknew who he was a violent disturbance arose people ran together and\\nwanted to lend the two some help in their need but against the\\nsoldiers they could do nothing news of this at length came to the\\nking who was very angry and ordered a captain to march out with his\\ntroop and drive this disturber of the peace out of the town but the\\nman with the knapsack soon got a greater body of men together who\\nrepulsed the captain and his men so that they were forced to retire\\nwith bloody noses the king said this vagabond is not brought to\\norder yet and next day sent a still larger troop against him but\\nthey could do even less the youth set still more men against them and\\nin order to be done the sooner he turned his hat twice round on his\\nhead and heavy guns began to play and the kings men were beaten and\\nput to flight and now said he i will not make peace until the\\nking gives me his daughter to wife and i govern the whole kingdom in\\nhis name he caused this to be announced to the king and the latter\\nsaid to his daughter necessity is a hard nut to crack what remains\\nto me but to do what he desires if i want peace and to keep the crown\\non my head i must give thee away\\n\\nso the wedding was celebrated but the kings daughter was vexed that\\nher husband should be a common man who wore a shabby hat and put on\\nan old knapsack she wished much to get rid of him and night and day\\nstudied how she could accomplished this then she thought to herself\\nis it possible that his wonderful powers lie in the knapsack and she\\ndissembled and caressed him and when his heart was softened she said\\nif thou wouldst but lay aside that ugly knapsack it makes disfigures\\nthee so that i cant help being ashamed of thee dear child said\\nhe this knapsack is my greatest treasure as long as i have it there\\nis no power on earth that i am afraid of and he revealed to her the\\nwonderful virtue with which it was endowed then she threw herself in\\nhis arms as if she were going to kiss him but dexterously took the\\nknapsack off his shoulders and ran away with it as soon as she was\\nalone she tapped it and commanded the warriors to seize their former\\nmaster and take him out of the royal palace they obeyed and the\\nfalse wife sent still more men after him who were to drive him quite\\nout of the country then he would have been ruined if he had not had\\nthe little hat but his hands were scarcely at liberty before he turned\\nit twice immediately the cannon began to thunder and struck down\\neverything and the kings daughter herself was forced to come and beg\\nfor mercy as she entreated in such moving terms and promised\\namendment he allowed himself to be persuaded and granted her peace\\nshe behaved in a friendly manner to him and acted as if she loved him\\nvery much and after some time managed so to befool him that he\\nconfided to her that even if someone got the knapsack into his power\\nhe could do nothing against him so long as the old hat was still his\\nwhen she knew the secret she waited until he was asleep and then she\\ntook the hat away from him and had it thrown out into the street but\\nthe horn still remained to him and in great anger he blew it with all\\nhis strength instantly all walls fortifications towns and villages\\ntoppled down and crushed the king and his daughter to death and had\\nhe not put down the horn and had blown just a little longer everything\\nwould have been in ruins and not one stone would have been left\\nstanding on another then no one opposed him any longer and he made\\nhimself king of the whole country',\n",

       " 'in the olden time there was a king who had behind his palace a\\nbeautiful pleasuregarden in which there was a tree that bore golden\\napples when the apples were getting ripe they were counted but on the\\nvery next morning one was missing this was told to the king and he\\nordered that a watch should be kept every night beneath the tree\\n\\nthe king had three sons the eldest of whom he sent as soon as night\\ncame on into the garden but when midnight came he could not keep\\nhimself from sleeping and next morning again an apple was gone\\n\\nthe following night the second son had to keep watch it fared no\\nbetter with him as soon as twelve oclock had struck he fell asleep\\nand in the morning an apple was gone\\n\\nnow it came to the turn of the third son to watch and he was quite\\nready but the king had not much trust in him and thought that he\\nwould be of less use even than his brothers but at last he let him go\\nthe youth lay down beneath the tree but kept awake and did not let\\nsleep master him when it struck twelve something rustled through the\\nair and in the moonlight he saw a bird coming whose feathers were all\\nshining with gold the bird alighted on the tree and had just plucked\\noff an apple when the youth shot an arrow at him the bird flew off\\nbut the arrow had struck his plumage and one of his golden feathers\\nfell down the youth picked it up and the next morning took it to the\\nking and told him what he had seen in the night the king called his\\ncouncil together and everyone declared that a feather like this was\\nworth more than the whole kingdom if the feather is so precious\\ndeclared the king one alone will not do for me i must and will have\\nthe whole bird\\n\\nthe eldest son set out he trusted to his cleverness and thought that\\nhe would easily find the golden bird when he had gone some distance he\\nsaw a fox sitting at the edge of a wood so he cocked his gun and took\\naim at him the fox cried do not shoot me and in return i will give\\nyou some good counsel you are on the way to the golden bird and this\\nevening you will come to a village in which stand two inns opposite to\\none another one of them is lighted up brightly and all goes on\\nmerrily within but do not go into it go rather into the other even\\nthough it seems a bad one how can such a silly beast give wise\\nadvice thought the kings son and he pulled the trigger but he\\nmissed the fox who stretched out his tail and ran quickly into the\\nwood\\n\\nso he pursued his way and by evening came to the village where the two\\ninns were in one they were singing and dancing the other had a poor\\nmiserable look i should be a fool indeed he thought if i were to\\ngo into the shabby tavern and pass by the good one so he went into\\nthe cheerful one lived there in riot and revel and forgot the bird\\nand his father and all good counsels\\n\\nwhen some time had passed and the eldest son for month after month did\\nnot come back home the second set out wishing to find the golden\\nbird the fox met him as he had met the eldest and gave him the good\\nadvice of which he took no heed he came to the two inns and his\\nbrother was standing at the window of the one from which came the\\nmusic and called out to him he could not resist but went inside and\\nlived only for pleasure\\n\\nagain some time passed and then the kings youngest son wanted to set\\noff and try his luck but his father would not allow it it is of no\\nuse said he he will find the golden bird still less than his\\nbrothers and if a mishap were to befall him he knows not how to help\\nhimself he is a little wanting at the best but at last as he had no\\npeace he let him go\\n\\nagain the fox was sitting outside the wood and begged for his life\\nand offered his good advice the youth was goodnatured and said be\\neasy little fox i will do you no harm you shall not repent it\\nanswered the fox and that you may get on more quickly get up behind\\non my tail and scarcely had he seated himself when the fox began to\\nrun and away he went over stock and stone till his hair whistled in\\nthe wind when they came to the village the youth got off he followed\\nthe good advice and without looking round turned into the little inn\\nwhere he spent the night quietly\\n\\nthe next morning as soon as he got into the open country there sat\\nthe fox already and said i will tell you further what you have to\\ndo go on quite straight and at last you will come to a castle in\\nfront of which a whole regiment of soldiers is lying but do not\\ntrouble yourself about them for they will all be asleep and snoring\\ngo through the midst of them straight into the castle and go through\\nall the rooms till at last you will come to a chamber where a golden\\nbird is hanging in a wooden cage close by there stands an empty gold\\ncage for show but beware of taking the bird out of the common cage and\\nputting it into the fine one or it may go badly with you with these\\nwords the fox again stretched out his tail and the kings son seated\\nhimself upon it and away he went over stock and stone till his hair\\nwhistled in the wind\\n\\nwhen he came to the castle he found everything as the fox had said the\\nkings son went into the chamber where the golden bird was shut up in a\\nwooden cage whilst a golden one stood hard by and the three golden\\napples lay about the room but thought he it would be absurd if i\\nwere to leave the beautiful bird in the common and ugly cage so he\\nopened the door laid hold of it and put it into the golden cage but\\nat the same moment the bird uttered a shrill cry the soldiers awoke\\nrushed in and took him off to prison the next morning he was taken\\nbefore a court of justice and as he confessed everything was\\nsentenced to death\\n\\nthe king however said that he would grant him his life on one\\ncondition namely if he brought him the golden horse which ran faster\\nthan the wind and in that case he should receive over and above as a\\nreward the golden bird\\n\\nthe kings son set off but he sighed and was sorrowful for how was he\\nto find the golden horse but all at once he saw his old friend the fox\\nsitting on the road look you said the fox this has happened\\nbecause you did not give heed to me however be of good courage i\\nwill give you my help and tell you how to get to the golden horse you\\nmust go straight on and you will come to a castle where in the stable\\nstands the horse the grooms will be lying in front of the stable but\\nthey will be asleep and snoring and you can quietly lead out the\\ngolden horse but of one thing you must take heed put on him the\\ncommon saddle of wood and leather and not the golden one which hangs\\nclose by else it will go ill with you then the fox stretched out his\\ntail the kings son seated himself upon it and away he went over\\nstock and stone until his hair whistled in the wind\\n\\neverything happened just as the fox had said the prince came to the\\nstable in which the golden horse was standing but just as he was going\\nto put the common saddle upon him he thought it will be a shame to\\nsuch a beautiful beast if i do not give him the good saddle which\\nbelongs to him by right but scarcely had the golden saddle touched\\nthe horse than he began to neigh loudly the grooms awoke seized the\\nyouth and threw him into prison the next morning he was sentenced by\\nthe court to death but the king promised to grant him his life and\\nthe golden horse as well if he could bring back the beautiful princess\\nfrom the golden castle\\n\\nwith a heavy heart the youth set out yet luckily for him he soon found\\nthe trusty fox i ought only to leave you to your illluck said the\\nfox but i pity you and will help you once more out of your trouble\\nthis road takes you straight to the golden castle you will reach it by\\neventide and at night when everything is quiet the beautiful princess\\ngoes to the bathinghouse to bathe when she enters it run up to her\\nand give her a kiss then she will follow you and you can take her\\naway with you only do not allow her to take leave of her parents\\nfirst or it will go ill with you\\n\\nthen the fox stretched out his tail the kings son seated himself upon\\nit and away the fox went over stock and stone till his hair whistled\\nin the wind\\n\\nwhen he reached the golden castle it was just as the fox had said he\\nwaited until midnight when everything lay in deep sleep and the\\nbeautiful princess was going to the bathinghouse then he sprang out\\nand gave her a kiss she said that she would like to go with him but\\nshe asked him pitifully and with tears to allow her first to take\\nleave of her parents at first he withstood her prayer but when she\\nwept more and more and fell at his feet he at last gave in but no\\nsooner had the maiden reached the bedside of her father than he and all\\nthe rest in the castle awoke and the youth was laid hold of and put\\ninto prison\\n\\nthe next morning the king said to him your life is forfeited and you\\ncan only find mercy if you take away the hill which stands in front of\\nmy windows and prevents my seeing beyond it and you must finish it\\nall within eight days if you do that you shall have my daughter as\\nyour reward\\n\\nthe kings son began and dug and shovelled without leaving off but\\nwhen after seven days he saw how little he had done and how all his\\nwork was as good as nothing he fell into great sorrow and gave up all\\nhope but on the evening of the seventh day the fox appeared and said\\nyou do not deserve that i should take any trouble about you but just\\ngo away and lie down to sleep and i will do the work for you\\n\\nthe next morning when he awoke and looked out of the window the hill\\nhad gone the youth ran full of joy to the king and told him that\\nthe task was fulfilled and whether he liked it or not the king had to\\nhold to his word and give him his daughter\\n\\nso the two set forth together and it was not long before the trusty\\nfox came up with them you have certainly got what is best said he\\nbut the golden horse also belongs to the maiden of the golden castle\\nhow shall i get it asked the youth that i will tell you answered\\nthe fox first take the beautiful maiden to the king who sent you to\\nthe golden castle there will be unheardof rejoicing they will gladly\\ngive you the golden horse and will bring it out to you mount it as\\nsoon as possible and offer your hand to all in farewell last of all\\nto the beautiful maiden and as soon as you have taken her hand swing\\nher up on to the horse and gallop away and no one will be able to\\nbring you back for the horse runs faster than the wind\\n\\nall was carried out successfully and the kings son carried off the\\nbeautiful princess on the golden horse\\n\\nthe fox did not remain behind and he said to the youth now i will\\nhelp you to get the golden bird when you come near to the castle where\\nthe golden bird is to be found let the maiden get down and i will\\ntake her into my care then ride with the golden horse into the\\ncastleyard there will be great rejoicing at the sight and they will\\nbring out the golden bird for you as soon as you have the cage in your\\nhand gallop back to us and take the maiden away again\\n\\nwhen the plan had succeeded and the kings son was about to ride home\\nwith his treasures the fox said now you shall reward me for my\\nhelp what do you require for it asked the youth when you get\\ninto the wood yonder shoot me dead and chop off my head and feet\\n\\nthat would be fine gratitude said the kings son i cannot possibly\\ndo that for you\\n\\nthe fox said if you will not do it i must leave you but before i go\\naway i will give you a piece of good advice be careful about two\\nthings buy no gallowsflesh and do not sit at the edge of any well\\nand then he ran into the wood\\n\\nthe youth thought that is a wonderful beast he has strange whims\\nwho is going to buy gallowsflesh and the desire to sit at the edge\\nof a well it has never yet seized me\\n\\nhe rode on with the beautiful maiden and his road took him again\\nthrough the village in which his two brothers had remained there was a\\ngreat stir and noise and when he asked what was going on he was told\\nthat two men were going to be hanged as he came nearer to the place he\\nsaw that they were his brothers who had been playing all kinds of\\nwicked pranks and had squandered all their wealth he inquired whether\\nthey could not be set free if you will pay for them answered the\\npeople but why should you waste your money on wicked men and buy\\nthem free he did not think twice about it but paid for them and\\nwhen they were set free they all went on their way together\\n\\nthey came to the wood where the fox had first met them as it was cool\\nand pleasant within it the two brothers said let us rest a little by\\nthe well and eat and drink he agreed and whilst they were talking\\nhe forgot himself and sat down upon the edge of the well without\\nthinking of any evil but the two brothers threw him backwards into the\\nwell took the maiden the horse and the bird and went home to their\\nfather here we bring you not only the golden bird said they we\\nhave won the golden horse also and the maiden from the golden castle\\nthen was there great joy but the horse would not eat the bird would\\nnot sing and the maiden sat and wept\\n\\nbut the youngest brother was not dead by good fortune the well was\\ndry and he fell upon soft moss without being hurt but he could not\\nget out again even in this strait the faithful fox did not leave him\\nit came and leapt down to him and upbraided him for having forgotten\\nits advice but yet i cannot give it up so he said i will help you\\nup again into daylight he bade him grasp his tail and keep tight hold\\nof it and then he pulled him up\\n\\nyou are not out of all danger yet said the fox your brothers were\\nnot sure of your death and have surrounded the wood with watchers who\\nare to kill you if you let yourself be seen but a poor man was\\nsitting upon the road with whom the youth changed clothes and in this\\nway he got to the kings palace\\n\\nno one knew him but the bird began to sing the horse began to eat\\nand the beautiful maiden left off weeping the king astonished asked\\nwhat does this mean then the maiden said i do not know but i have\\nbeen so sorrowful and now i am so happy i feel as if my true\\nbridegroom had come she told him all that had happened although the\\nother brothers had threatened her with death if she were to betray\\nanything\\n\\nthe king commanded that all people who were in his castle should be\\nbrought before him and amongst them came the youth in his ragged\\nclothes but the maiden knew him at once and fell upon his neck the\\nwicked brothers were seized and put to death but he was married to the\\nbeautiful maiden and declared heir to the king\\n\\nbut how did it fare with the poor fox long afterwards the kings son\\nwas once again walking in the wood when the fox met him and said you\\nhave everything now that you can wish for but there is never an end to\\nmy misery and yet it is in your power to free me and again he asked\\nhim with tears to shoot him dead and chop off his head and feet so he\\ndid it and scarcely was it done when the fox was changed into a man\\nand was no other than the brother of the beautiful princess who at\\nlast was freed from the magic charm which had been laid upon him and\\nnow nothing more was wanting to their happiness as long as they lived',\n",
       " 'a sheepdog had not a good master but on the contrary one who let\\nhim suffer hunger as he could stay no longer with him he went quite\\nsadly away on the road he met a sparrow who said brother dog why\\nart thou so sad the dog replied i am hungry and have nothing to\\neat then said the sparrow dear brother come into the town with me\\nand i will satisfy thy hunger so they went into the town together\\nand when they came in front of a butchers shop the sparrow said to the\\ndog stay there and i will pick a bit of meat down for thee and he\\nalighted on the stall looked about him to see that no one was\\nobserving him and pecked and pulled and tore so long at a piece which\\nlay on the edge that it slipped down then the dog seized it ran into\\na corner and devoured it the sparrow said now come with me to\\nanother shop and then i will get thee one more piece that thou mayst\\nbe satisfied when the dog had devoured the second piece as well the\\nsparrow asked brother dog hast thou now had enough yes i have\\nhad meat enough he answered but i have had no bread yet said the\\nsparrow thou shalt have that also come with me then he took him to\\na bakers shop and pecked at a couple of little buns till they rolled\\ndown and as the dog wanted still more he led him to another stall\\nand again got bread for him when that was consumed the sparrow said\\nbrother dog hast thou now had enough yes he replied now we\\nwill walk awhile outside the town then they both went out on to the\\nhighway it was however warm weather and when they had walked a\\nlittle way the dog said i am tired and would like to sleep well\\ndo sleep answered the sparrow and in the meantime i will seat\\nmyself on a branch so the dog lay down on the road and fell fast\\nasleep whilst he lay sleeping there a waggoner came driving by who\\nhad a cart with three horses laden with two barrels of wine the\\nsparrow however saw that he was not going to turn aside but was\\nstaying in the wheel track in which the dog was lying so it cried\\nwaggoner dont do it or i will make thee poor the waggoner\\nhowever growled to himself thou wilt not make me poor and cracked\\nhis whip and drove the cart over the dog and the wheels killed him\\nthen the sparrow cried thou hast run over my brother dog and killed\\nhim it shall cost thee thy cart and horses cart and horses indeed\\nsaid the waggoner what harm canst thou do me and drove onwards\\nthen the sparrow crept under the cover of the cart and pecked so long\\nat the same bunghole that he got the bung out and then all the wine\\nran out without the driver noticing it but once when he was looking\\nbehind him he saw that the cart was dripping and looked at the barrels\\nand saw that one of them was empty unfortunate fellow that i am\\ncried he not unfortunate enough yet said the sparrow and flew on\\nto the head of one of the horses and pecked his eyes out when the\\ndriver saw that he drew out his axe and wanted to hit the sparrow but\\nthe sparrow flew into the air and he hit his horse on the head and it\\nfell down dead oh what an unfortunate man i am cried he not\\nunfortunate enough yet said the sparrow and when the driver drove on\\nwith the two horses the sparrow again crept under the cover and\\npecked the bung out of the second cask so all the wine was spilt when\\nthe driver became aware of it he again cried oh what an unfortunate\\nman i am but the sparrow replied not unfortunate enough yet and\\nseated himself on the head of the second horse and pecked his eyes\\nout the driver ran up to it and raised his axe to strike but the\\nsparrow flew into the air and the blow struck the horse which fell\\noh what an unfortunate man i am not unfortunate enough yet said\\nthe sparrow and lighted on the third horses head and pecked out his\\neyes the driver in his rage struck at the sparrow without looking\\nround and did not hit him but killed his third horse likewise oh\\nwhat an unfortunate man i am cried he not unfortunate enough yet\\nanswered the sparrow now will i make thee unfortunate in thy home\\nand flew away\\n\\nthe driver had to leave the waggon standing and full of anger and\\nvexation went home ah said he to his wife what misfortunes i have\\nhad my wine has run out and the horses are all three dead alas\\nhusband she answered what a malicious bird has come into the house\\nit has gathered together every bird there is in the world and they\\nhave fallen on our corn up there and are devouring it then he went\\nupstairs and thousands and thousands of birds were sitting in the loft\\nand had eaten up all the corn and the sparrow was sitting in the midst\\nof them then the driver cried oh what an unfortunate man i am\\n\\nnot unfortunate enough yet answered the sparrow waggoner it shall\\ncost thee thy life as well and flew out\\n\\nthen the waggoner had lost all his property and he went downstairs\\ninto the room sat down behind the stove and was quite furious and\\nbitter but the sparrow sat outside in front of the window and cried\\nwaggoner it shall cost thee thy life then the waggoner snatched the\\naxe and threw it at the sparrow but it only broke the window and did\\nnot hit the bird the sparrow now hopped in placed itself on the stove\\nand cried waggoner it shall cost thee thy life the latter quite\\nmad and blind with rage smote the stove in twain and as the sparrow\\nflew from one place to another so it fared with all his household\\nfurniture lookingglass benches table and at last the walls of his\\nhouse and yet he could not hit the bird at length however he caught\\nit with his hand then his wife said shall i kill it no cried\\nhe that would be too merciful it shall die much more cruelly and\\nhe took it and swallowed it whole the sparrow however began to\\nflutter about in his body and fluttered up again into the mans mouth\\nthen it stretched out its head and cried waggoner it shall still\\ncost thee thy life the

       " 'there was once on a time a man who was called frederick and a woman\\ncalled catherine who had married each other and lived together as\\nyoung married folks one day frederick said i will now go and plough\\ncatherine when i come back there must be some roast meat on the table\\nfor hunger and a fresh draught for thirst just go frederick\\nanswered kate just go i will have all ready for you therefore when\\ndinnertime drew near she got a sausage out of the chimney put it in\\nthe fryingpan put some butter to it and set it on the fire the\\nsausage began to fry and to hiss catherine stood beside it and held\\nthe handle of the pan and had her own thoughts as she was doing it\\nthen it occurred to her while the sausage is getting done thou\\ncouldst go into the cellar and draw beer so she set the fryingpan\\nsafely on the fire took a can and went down into the cellar to draw\\nbeer the beer ran into the can and kate watched it and then she\\nthought oh dear the dog upstairs is not fastened up it might get\\nthe sausage out of the pan well thought of and in a trice she was up\\nthe cellarsteps again but the spitz had the sausage in its mouth\\nalready and trailed it away on the ground but catherine who was not\\nidle set out after it and chased it a long way into the field the\\ndog however was swifter than catherine and did not let the sausage\\njourney easily but skipped over the furrows with it whats gone is\\ngone said kate and turned round and as she had run till she was\\nweary she walked quietly and comfortably and cooled herself during\\nthis time the beer was still running out of the cask for kate had not\\nturned the tap and when the can was full and there was no other place\\nfor it it ran into the cellar and did not stop until the whole cask\\nwas empty as soon as kate was on the steps she saw the mischance\\ngood gracious she cried what shall i do now to stop frederick\\nknowing it she thought for a while and at last she remembered that\\nup in the garret was still standing a sack of the finest wheat flour\\nfrom the last fair and she would fetch that down and strew it over the\\nbeer yes said she he who saves a thing when he ought has it\\nafterwards when he needs it and she climbed up to the garret and\\ncarried the sack below and threw it straight down on the can of beer\\nwhich she knocked over and fredericks draught swam also in the\\ncellar it is all right said kate where the one is the other ought\\nto be also and she strewed the meal over the whole cellar when it\\nwas done she was heartily delighted with her work and said how clean\\nand wholesome it does look here at midday home came frederick now\\nwife what have you ready for me ah freddy she answered i was\\nfrying a sausage for you but whilst i was drawing the beer to drink\\nwith it the dog took it away out of the pan and whilst i was running\\nafter the dog all the beer ran out and whilst i was drying up the\\nbeer with the flour i knocked over the can as well but be easy the\\ncellar is quite dry again said frederick kate kate you should not\\nhave done that to let the sausage be carried off and the beer run out\\nof the cask and throw out all our flour into the bargain indeed\\nfrederick i did not know that you should have told me the man\\nthought if my wife is like this i must look after things more now\\nhe had got together a good number of thalers which he changed into\\ngold and said to catherine look these are counters for playing\\ngames i will put them in a pot and bury them in the stable under the\\ncows manger but mind you keep away from them or it will be the worse\\nfor you said she oh no frederick i certainly will not go and\\nwhen frederick was gone some pedlars came into the village who had\\ncheap earthenbowls and pots and asked the young woman if there was\\nnothing she wanted to bargain with them for oh dear people said\\ncatherine i have no money and can buy nothing but if you have any\\nuse for yellow counters i will buy of you yellow counters why not\\nbut just let us see them then go into the stable and dig under the\\ncows manger and you will find the yellow counters i am not allowed\\nto go there the rogues went thither dug and found pure gold then\\nthey laid hold of it ran away and left their pots and bowls behind in\\nthe house catherine thought she must use her new things and as she\\nhad no lack in the kitchen already without these she knocked the\\nbottom out of every pot and set them all as ornaments on the paling\\nwhich went round about the house when frederick came and saw the new\\ndecorations he said catherine what have you been about i have\\nbought them frederick for the counters which were under the cows\\nmanger i did not go there myself the pedlars had to dig them out for\\nthemselves ah wife said frederick what have you done those\\nwere not counters but pure gold and all our wealth you should not\\nhave done that indeed frederick said she i did not know that\\nyou should have forewarned me\\n\\ncatherine stood for a while and bethought to herself then she said\\nlisten frederick we will soon get the gold back again we will run\\nafter the thieves come then said frederick we will try it but\\ntake with you some butter and cheese that we may have something to eat\\non the way yes frederick i will take them they set out and as\\nfrederick was the better walker catherine followed him it is to my\\nadvantage thought she when we turn back i shall be a little way in\\nadvance then she came to a hill where there were deep ruts on both\\nsides of the road there one can see said catherine how they have\\ntorn and skinned and galled the poor earth it will never be whole\\nagain as long as it lives and in her hearts compassion she took her\\nbutter and smeared the ruts right and left that they might not be so\\nhurt by the wheels and as she was thus bending down in her charity\\none of the cheeses rolled out of her pocket down the hill said\\ncatherine i have made my way once up here i will not go down again\\nanother may run and fetch it back so she took another cheese and\\nrolled it down but the cheeses did not come back so she let a third\\nrun down thinking perhaps they are waiting for company and do not\\nlike to walk alone as all three stayed away she said i do not know\\nwhat that can mean but it may perhaps be that the third has not found\\nthe way and has gone wrong i will just send the fourth to call it\\nbut the fourth did no better than the third then catherine was angry\\nand threw down the fifth and sixth as well and these were her last\\nshe remained standing for some time watching for their coming but when\\nthey still did not come she said oh you are good folks to send in\\nsearch of death you stay a fine long time away do you think i will\\nwait any longer for you i shall go my way you may run after me you\\nhave younger legs than i catherine went on and found frederick who\\nwas standing waiting for her because he wanted something to eat now\\njust let us have what you have brought with you said he she gave him\\nthe dry bread where have you the butter and the cheeses asked the\\nman ah freddy said catherine i smeared the cartruts with the\\nbutter and the cheeses will come soon one ran away from me so i sent\\nthe others after to call it said frederick you should not have done\\nthat catherine to smear the butter on the road and let the cheeses\\nrun down the hill really frederick you should have told me then\\nthey ate the dry bread together and frederick said catherine did\\nyou make the house safe when you came away no frederick you should\\nhave told me to do it before then go home again and make the house\\nsafe before we go any farther and bring with you something else to\\neat i will wait here for you catherine went back and thought\\nfrederick wants something more to eat he does not like butter and\\ncheese so i will take with me a handkerchief full of dried pears and a\\npitcher of vinegar for him to drink then she bolted the upper half of\\nthe door fast but unhinged the lower door and took it on her back\\nbelieving that when she had placed the door in security the house must\\nbe well taken care of catherine took her time on the way and thought\\nfrederick will rest himself so much the longer when she had once\\nreached him she said here is the housedoor for you frederick and\\nnow you can take care of the house yourself oh heavens said he\\nwhat a wise wife i have she takes the underdoor off the hinges that\\neverything may run in and bolts the upper one it is now too late to\\ngo back home again but since you have brought the door here you shall\\njust carry it farther i will carry the door frederick but the\\ndried pears and the vinegarjug will be too heavy for me i will hang\\nthem on the door it may carry them\\n\\nand now they went into the forest and sought the rogues but did not\\nfind them at length as it grew dark they climbed into a tree and\\nresolved to spend the night there scarcely however had they sat down\\nat the top of it than the rascals came thither who carry away with them\\nwhat does not want to go and find things before they are lost they\\nsat down under the very tree in which frederick and catherine were\\nsitting lighted a fire and were about to share their booty frederick\\ngot down on the other side and collected some stones together then he\\nclimbed up again with them and wished to throw them at the thieves and\\nkill them the stones however did not hit them and the knaves cried\\nit will soon be morning the wind is shaking down the firapples\\ncatherine still had the door on her back and as it pressed so heavily\\non her she thought it was the fault of the dried pears and said\\nfrederick i must throw the pears down no catherine not now he\\nreplied they might betray us oh but frederick i must they\\nweigh me down far too much do it then and be hanged then the\\ndried pears rolled down between the branches and the rascals below\\nsaid the leaves are falling\\n\\na short time afterwards as the door was still heavy catherine said\\nah frederick i must pour out the vinegar no catherine you must\\nnot it might betray us ah but frederick i must it weighs me\\ndown far too much then do it and be hanged so she emptied out the\\nvinegar and it besprinkled the robbers they said amongst themselves\\nthe dew is already falling at length catherine thought can it\\nreally be the door which weighs me down so and said frederick i\\nmust throw the door down no not now catherine it might discover\\nus oh but frederick i must it weighs me down far too much oh\\nno catherine do hold it fast ah frederick i am letting it fall\\nlet it go then in the devils name then it fell down with a\\nviolent clatter and the rascals below cried the devil is coming down\\nthe tree and they ran away and left everything behind them early\\nnext morning when the two came down they found all their gold again\\nand carried it home\\n\\nwhen they were once more at home frederick said and now catherine\\nyou too must be industrious and work yes frederick i will soon\\ndo that i will go into the field and cut corn when catherine got\\ninto the field she said to herself shall i eat before i cut or\\nshall i sleep before i cut oh i will eat first then catherine ate\\nand eating made her sleepy and she began to cut and half in a dream\\ncut all her clothes to pieces her apron her gown and her shift when\\ncatherine awoke again after a long sleep she was standing there\\nhalfnaked and said to herself is it i or is it not i alas it is\\nnot i in the meantime night came and catherine ran into the village\\nknocked at her husbands window and cried frederick\\n\\nwhat is the matter i should very much like to know if catherine is\\nin yes yes replied frederick she must be in and asleep\\n\\nsaid she tis well then i am certainly at home already and ran\\naway\\n\\noutside catherine found some vagabonds who were going to steal then\\nshe went to them and said i will help you to steal the rascals\\nthought that she knew the situation of the place and were willing\\ncatherine went in front of the houses and cried good folks have you\\nanything we want to steal the thieves thought to themselves thats\\na fine way of doing things and wished themselves once more rid of\\ncatherine then they said to her outside the village the pastor has\\nsome turnips in the field go there and pull up some turnips for us\\ncatherine went to the ground and began to pull them up but was so\\nidle that she did not gather them together then a man came by saw\\nher and stood still and thought that it was the devil who was thus\\nrooting amongst the turnips he ran away into the village to the\\npastor and said mr pastor the devil is in your turnipground\\nrooting up turnips ah heavens answered the pastor i have a lame\\nfoot i cannot go out and drive him away said the man then i will\\ncarry you on my back and he carried him out on his back and when\\nthey came to the ground catherine arose and stood up her full height\\nah the devil cried the pastor and both hurried away and in his\\ngreat fright the pastor could run better with his lame foot than the\\nman who had carried him on his back could do with his sound one',\n",
       " 'there were once upon a time two brothers one rich and the other poor\\nthe rich one was a goldsmith and evilhearted the poor one supported\\nhimself by making brooms and was good and honourable the poor one had\\ntwo children who were twin brothers and as like each other as two\\ndrops of water the two boys went backwards and forwards to the rich\\nhouse and often got some of the scraps to eat it happened once when\\nthe poor man was going into the forest to fetch brushwood that he saw\\na bird which was quite golden and more beautiful than any he had ever\\nchanced to meet with he picked up a small stone threw it at him and\\nwas lucky enough to hit him but one golden feather only fell down and\\nthe bird flew away the man took the feather and carried it to his\\nbrother who looked at it and said it is pure gold and gave him a\\ngreat deal of money for it next day the man climbed into a birchtree\\nand was about to cut off a couple of branches when the same bird flew\\nout and when the man searched he found a nest and an egg lay inside\\nit which was of gold he took the egg home with him and carried it to\\nhis brother who again said it is pure gold and gave him what it\\nwas worth at last the goldsmith said i should indeed like to have\\nthe bird itself the poor man went into the forest for the third time\\nand again saw the golden bird sitting on the tree so he took a stone\\nand brought it down and carried it to his brother who gave him a great\\nheap of gold for it now i can get on thought he and went\\ncontentedly home\\n\\nthe goldsmith was crafty and cunning and knew very well what kind of a\\nbird it was he called his wife and said roast me the gold bird and\\ntake care that none of it is lost i have a fancy to eat it all\\nmyself the bird however was no common one but of so wondrous a\\nkind that whosoever ate its heart and liver found every morning a piece\\nof gold beneath his pillow the woman made the bird ready put it on\\nthe spit and let it roast now it happened that while it was at the\\nfire and the woman was forced to go out of the kitchen on account of\\nsome other work the two children of the poor broommaker ran in stood\\nby the spit and turned it round once or twice and as at that very\\nmoment two little bits of the bird fell down into the drippingtin one\\nof the boys said we will eat these two little bits i am so hungry\\nand no one will ever miss them then the two ate the pieces but the\\nwoman came into the kitchen and saw that they were eating something and\\nsaid what have ye been eating two little morsels which fell out of\\nthe bird answered they that must have been the heart and the\\nliver said the woman quite frightened and in order that her husband\\nmight not miss them and be angry she quickly killed a young cock took\\nout his heart and liver and put them beside the golden bird when it\\nwas ready she carried it to the goldsmith who consumed it all alone\\nand left none of it next morning however when he felt beneath his\\npillow and expected to bring out the piece of gold no more gold\\npieces were there than there had always been\\n\\nthe two children did not know what a piece of goodfortune had fallen\\nto their lot next morning when they arose something fell rattling to\\nthe ground and when they picked it up there were two gold pieces they\\ntook them to their father who was astonished and said how can that\\nhave happened when next morning they again found two and so on\\ndaily he went to his brother and told him the strange story the\\ngoldsmith at once knew how it had come to pass and that the children\\nhad eaten the heart and liver of the golden bird and in order to\\nrevenge himself and because he was envious and hardhearted he said\\nto the father thy children are in league with the evil one do not\\ntake the gold and do not suffer them to stay any longer in thy house\\nfor he has them in his power and may ruin thee likewise the father\\nfeared the evil one and painful as it was to him he nevertheless led\\nthe twins forth into the forest and with a sad heart left them there\\n\\nand now the two children ran about the forest and sought the way home\\nagain but could not find it and only lost themselves more and more\\nat length they met with a huntsman who asked to whom do you children\\nbelong we are the poor broommakers boys they replied and they\\ntold him that their father would not keep them any longer in the house\\nbecause a piece of gold lay every morning under their pillows come\\nsaid the huntsman that is nothing so very bad if at the same time\\nyou keep honest and are not idle as the good man liked the children\\nand had none of his own he took them home with him and said i will\\nbe your father and bring you up till you are big they learnt\\nhuntsmanship from him and the piece of gold which each of them found\\nwhen he awoke was kept for them by him in case they should need it in\\nthe future\\n\\nwhen they were grown up their fosterfather one day took them into the\\nforest with him and said today shall you make your trial shot so\\nthat i may release you from your apprenticeship and make you\\nhuntsmen they went with him to lie in wait and stayed there a long\\ntime but no game appeared the huntsman however looked above him and\\nsaw a covey of wild geese flying in the form of a triangle and said to\\none of them shoot me down one from each corner he did it and thus\\naccomplished his trial shot soon after another covey came flying by in\\nthe form of the figure two and the huntsman bade the other also bring\\ndown one from each corner and his trial shot was likewise successful\\nnow said the fosterfather i pronounce you out of your\\napprenticeship you are skilled huntsmen thereupon the two brothers\\nwent forth together into the forest and took counsel with each other\\nand planned something and in the evening when they had sat down to\\nsupper they said to their fosterfather we will not touch food or\\ntake one mouthful until you have granted us a request said he\\nwhat then is your request they replied we have now finished\\nlearning and we must prove ourselves in the world so allow us to go\\naway and travel then spake the old man joyfully you talk like brave\\nhuntsmen that which you desire has been my wish go forth all will go\\nwell with you thereupon they ate and drank joyously together\\n\\nwhen the appointed day came their fosterfather presented each of them\\nwith a good gun and a dog and let each of them take as many of his\\nsavedup gold pieces as he chose then he accompanied them a part of\\nthe way and when taking leave he gave them a bright knife and said\\nif ever you separate stick this knife into a tree at the place where\\nyou part and when one of you goes back he will will be able to see\\nhow his absent brother is faring for the side of the knife which is\\nturned in the direction by which he went will rust if he dies but\\nwill remain bright as long as he is alive the two brothers went still\\nfarther onwards and came to a forest which was so large that it was\\nimpossible for them to get out of it in one day so they passed the\\nnight in it and ate what they had put in their huntingpouches but\\nthey walked all the second day likewise and still did not get out as\\nthey had nothing to eat one of them said we must shoot something for\\nourselves or we shall suffer from hunger and loaded his gun and\\nlooked about him and when an old hare came running up towards them he\\nlaid his gun on his shoulder but the hare cried\\n\\ndear huntsman do but let me live\\ntwo little ones to thee ill give\\n\\n\\nand sprang instantly into the thicket and brought two young ones but\\nthe little creatures played so merrily and were so pretty that the\\nhuntsmen could not find it in their hearts to kill them they therefore\\nkept them with them and the little hares followed on foot soon after\\nthis a fox crept past they were just going to shoot it but the fox\\ncried\\n\\ndear hunstman do but let me live\\ntwo little ones ill also give\\n\\n\\nhe too brought two little foxes and the huntsmen did not like to\\nkill them either but gave them to the hares for company and they\\nfollowed behind it was not long before a wolf strode out of the\\nthicket the huntsmen made ready to shoot him but the wolf cried\\n\\ndear huntsman do but let me live\\ntwo little ones ill likewise give\\n\\n\\nthe huntsmen put the two wolves beside the other animals and they\\nfollowed behind them then a bear came who wanted to trot about a\\nlittle longer and cried\\n\\ndear huntsman do but let me live\\ntwo little ones i too will give\\n\\n\\nthe two young bears were added to the others and there were already\\neight of them at length who came a lion came and tossed his mane\\nbut the huntsmen did not let themselves be frightened and aimed at him\\nlikewise but the lion also said\\n\\ndear huntsman do but let me live\\ntwo little ones i too will give\\n\\n\\nand he brought his little ones to them and now the huntsmen had two\\nlions two bears two wolves two foxes and two hares who followed\\nthem and served them in thu meantime their hunger was not appeased by\\nthis and they said to the foxes hark ye cunning fellows provide us\\nwith something to eat you are crafty and deep they replied not far\\nfrom here lies a village from which we have already brought many a\\nfowl we will show you the way there so they went into the village\\nbought themselves something to eat had some food given to their\\nbeasts and then travelled onwards the foxes however knew their way\\nvery well about the district and where the poultryyards were and were\\nable to guide the huntsmen\\n\\nnow they travelled about for a while but could find no situations\\nwhere they could remain together so they said there is nothing else\\nfor it we must part they divided the animals so that each of them\\nhad a lion a bear a wolf a fox and a hare then they took leave of\\neach other promised to love each other like brothers till their death\\nand stuck the knife which their fosterfather had given them into a\\ntree after which one went east and the other went west\\n\\nthe younger however arrived with his beasts in a town which was all\\nhung with black crape he went into an inn and asked the host if he\\ncould accommodate his animals the innkeeper gave him a stable where\\nthere was a hole in the wall and the hare crept out and fetched\\nhimself the head of a cabbage and the fox fetched himself a hen and\\nwhen he had devoured that got the cock as well but the wolf the bear\\nand the lion could not get out because they were too big then the\\ninnkeeper let them be taken to a place where a cow was just then lying\\non the grass that they might eat till they were satisfied and when\\nthe huntsman had taken care of his animals he asked the innkeeper why\\nthe town was thus hung with black crape said the host because our\\nkings only daughter is to die tomorrow the huntsman inquired if she\\nwas sick unto death no answered the host she is vigorous and\\nhealthy nevertheless she must die how is that asked the huntsman\\nthere is a high hill without the town whereon dwells a dragon who\\nevery year must have a pure virgin or he lays the whole country waste\\nand now all the maidens have already been given to him and there is no\\nlonger anyone left but the kings daughter yet there is no mercy for\\nher she must be given up to him and that is to be done tomorrow\\nsaid the huntsman why is the dragon not killed ah replied the\\nhost so many knights have tried it but it has cost all of them their\\nlives the king has promised that he who conquers the dragon shall have\\nhis daughter to wife and shall likewise govern the kingdom after his\\nown death\\n\\nthe huntsman said nothing more to this but next morning took his\\nanimals and with them ascended the dragons hill a little church\\nstood at the top of it and on the altar three full cups were standing\\nwith the inscription whosoever empties the cups will become the\\nstrongest man on earth and will be able to wield the sword which is\\nburied before the threshold of the door the huntsman did not drink\\nbut went out and sought for the sword in the ground but was unable to\\nmove it from its place then he went in and emptied the cups and now\\nhe was strong enough to take up the sword and his hand could quite\\neasily wield it when the hour came when the maiden was to be delivered\\nover to the dragon the king the marshal and courtiers accompanied\\nher from afar she saw the huntsman on the dragons hill and thought\\nit was the dragon standing there waiting for her and did not want to\\ngo up to him but at last because otherwise the whole town would have\\nbeen destroyed she was forced to go the miserable journey the king\\nand courtiers returned home full of grief the kings marshal however\\nwas to stand still and see all from a distance\\n\\nwhen the kings daughter got to the top of the hill it was not the\\ndragon which stood there but the young huntsman who comforted her\\nand said he would save her led her into the church and locked her in\\nit was not long before the sevenheaded dragon came thither with loud\\nroaring when he perceived the huntsman he was astonished and said\\nwhat business hast thou here on the hill the huntsman answered i\\nwant to fight with thee said the dragon many knights have left\\ntheir lives here i shall soon have made an end of thee too and he\\nbreathed fire out of seven jaws the fire was to have lighted the dry\\ngrass and the huntsman was to have been suffocated in the heat and\\nsmoke but the animals came running up and trampled out the fire then\\nthe dragon rushed upon the huntsman but he swung his sword until it\\nsang through the air and struck off three of his heads then the\\ndragon grew right furious and rose up in the air and spat out flames\\nof fire over the huntsman and was about to plunge down on him but the\\nhuntsman once more drew out his sword and again cut off three of his\\nheads the monster became faint and sank down nevertheless it was just\\nable to rush upon the huntsman but he with his last strength smote its\\ntail off and as he could fight no longer called up his animals who\\ntore it in pieces when the struggle was ended the huntsman unlocked\\nthe church and found the kings daughter lying on the floor as she\\nhad lost her senses with anguish and terror during the contest he\\ncarried her out and when she came to herself once more and opened her\\neyes he showed her the dragon all cut to pieces and told her that she\\nwas now delivered she rejoiced and said now thou wilt be my dearest\\nhusband for my father has promised me to him who kills the dragon\\nthereupon she took off her necklace of coral and divided it amongst\\nthe animals in order to reward them and the lion received the golden\\nclasp her pockethandkerchief however on which was her name she\\ngave to the huntsman who went and cut the tongues out of the dragons\\nseven heads wrapped them in the handkerchief and preserved them\\ncarefully\\n\\nthat done as he was so faint and weary with the fire and the battle\\nhe said to the maiden we are both faint and weary we will sleep\\nawhile then she said yes and they lay down on the ground and the\\nhuntsman said to the lion thou shalt keep watch that no one\\nsurprises us in our sleep and both fell asleep the lion lay down\\nbeside them to watch but he also was so weary with the fight that he\\ncalled to the bear and said lie down near me i must sleep a little\\nif anything comes waken me then the bear lay down beside him but he\\nalso was tired and called the wolf and said lie down by me i must\\nsleep a little but if anything comes waken me then the wolf lay\\ndown by him but he was tired likewise and called the fox and said\\nlie down by me i must sleep a little if anything comes waken me\\nthen the fox lay down beside him but he too was weary and called the\\nhare and said lie down near me i must sleep a little and if\\nanything should come waken me then the hare sat down by him but the\\npoor hare was tired too and had no one whom he could call there to\\nkeep watch and fell asleep and now the kings daughter the huntsman\\nthe lion the bear the wolf the fox and the hare were all sleeping\\na sound sleep the marshal however who was to look on from a\\ndistance took courage when he did not see the dragon flying away with\\nthe maiden and finding that all the hill had become quiet ascended\\nit there lay the dragon hacked and hewn to pieces on the ground and\\nnot far from it were the kings daughter and a huntsman with his\\nanimals and all of them were sunk in a sound sleep and as he was\\nwicked and godless he took his sword cut off the huntsmans head and\\nseized the maiden in his arms and carried her down the hill then she\\nawoke and was terrified but the marshal said thou art in my hands\\nthou shalt say that it was i who killed the dragon i cannot do\\nthat she replied for it was a huntsman with his animals who did\\nit then he drew his sword and threatened to kill her if she did not\\nobey him and so compelled her that she promised it then he took her\\nto the king who did not know how to contain himself for joy when he\\nonce more looked on his dear child in life whom he had believed to\\nhave been torn to pieces by the monster the marshal said to him i\\nhave killed the dragon and delivered the maiden and the whole kingdom\\nas well therefore i demand her as my wife as was promised the king\\nsaid to the maiden is what he says true ah yes she answered\\nit must indeed be true but i will not consent to have the wedding\\ncelebrated until after a year and a day for she thought in that time\\nshe should hear something of her dear huntsman\\n\\nthe animals however were still lying sleeping beside their dead\\nmaster on the dragons hill and there came a great humblebee and\\nlighted on the hares nose but the hare wiped it off with his paw and\\nwent on sleeping the humblebee came a second time but the hare again\\nrubbed it off and slept on then it came for the third time and stung\\nhis nose so that he awoke as soon as the hare was awake he roused the\\nfox and the fox the wolf and the wolf the bear and the bear the\\nlion and when the lion awoke and saw that the maiden was gone and his\\nmaster was dead he began to roar frightfully and cried who has done\\nthat bear why didst thou not waken me the bear asked the wolf why\\ndidst thou not waken me and the wolf the fox why didst thou not\\nwaken me and the fox the hare why didst thou not waken me the\\npoor hare alone did not know what answer to make and the blame rested\\nwith him then they were just going to fall upon him but he entreated\\nthem and said kill me not i will bring our master to life again i\\nknow a mountain on which a root grows which when placed in the mouth\\nof any one cures him of all illness and every wound but the mountain\\nlies two hundred hours journey from here the lion said in\\nfourandtwenty hours must thou have run thither and have come back\\nand have brought the root with thee then the hare sprang away and in\\nfourandtwenty hours he was back and brought the root with him the\\nlion put the huntsmans head on again and the hare placed the root in\\nhis mouth and immediately everything united together again and his\\nheart beat and life came back then the huntsman awoke and was\\nalarmed when he did not see the maiden and thought she must have\\ngone away whilst i was sleeping in order to get rid of me the lion\\nin his great haste had put his masters head on the wrong way round\\nbut the huntsman did not observe it because of his melancholy thoughts\\nabout the kings daughter but at noon when he was going to eat\\nsomething he saw that his head was turned backwards and could not\\nunderstand it and asked the animals what had happened to him in his\\nsleep then the lion told him that they too had all fallen asleep\\nfrom weariness and on awaking had found him dead with his head cut\\noff that the hare had brought the lifegiving root and that he in\\nhis haste had laid hold of the head the wrong way but that he would\\nrepair his mistake then he tore the huntsmans head off again turned\\nit round and the hare healed it with the root\\n\\nthe huntsman however was sad at heart and travelled about the world\\nand made his animals dance before people it came to pass that\\nprecisely at the end of one year he came back to the same town where he\\nhad delivered the kings daughter from the dragon and this time the\\ntown was gaily hung with red cloth then he said to the host what\\ndoes this mean last year the town was all hung with black crape what\\nmeans the red cloth today the host answered last year our kings\\ndaughter was to have been delivered over to the dragon but the marshal\\nfought with it and killed it and so tomorrow their wedding is to be\\nsolemnized and that is why the town was then hung with black crape for\\nmourning and is today covered with red cloth for joy\\n\\nnext day when the wedding was to take place the huntsman said at\\nmidday to the innkeeper do you believe sir host that i while with\\nyou here today shall eat bread from the kings own table nay said\\nthe host i would bet a hundred pieces of gold that that will not come\\ntrue the huntsman accepted the wager and set against it a purse with\\njust the same number of gold pieces then he called the hare and said\\ngo my dear runner and fetch me some of the bread which the king is\\neating now the little hare was the lowest of the animals and could\\nnot transfer this order to any the others but had to get on his legs\\nhimself alas thought he if i bound through the streets thus\\nalone the butchers dogs will all be after me it happened as he\\nexpected and the dogs came after him and wanted to make holes in his\\ngood skin but he sprang away have you have never seen one running\\nand sheltered himself in a sentrybox without the soldier being aware\\nof it then the dogs came and wanted to have him out but the soldier\\ndid not understand a jest and struck them with the buttend of his\\ngun till they ran away yelling and howling as soon as the hare saw\\nthat the way was clear he ran into the palace and straight to the\\nkings daughter sat down under her chair and scratched at her foot\\nthen she said wilt thou get away and thought it was her dog the\\nhare scratched her foot for the second time and she again said wilt\\nthou get away and thought it was her dog but the hare did not let\\nitself be turned from its purpose and scratched her for the third\\ntime then she peeped down and knew the hare by its collar she took\\nhim on her lap carried him into her chamber and said dear hare\\nwhat dost thou want he answered my master who killed the dragon\\nis here and has sent me to ask for a loaf of bread like that which the\\nking eats then she was full of joy and had the baker summoned and\\nordered him to bring a loaf such as was eaten by the king the little\\nhare said but the baker must likewise carry it thither for me that\\nthe butchers dogs may do no harm to me the baker carried if for him\\nas far as the door of the inn and then the hare got on his hind legs\\ntook the loaf in his front paws and carried it to his master then\\nsaid the huntsman behold sir host the hundred pieces of gold are\\nmine the host was astonished but the huntsman went on to say yes\\nsir host i have the bread but now i will likewise have some of the\\nkings roast meat\\n\\nthe host said i should indeed like to see that but he would make no\\nmore wagers the huntsman called the fox and said my little fox go\\nand fetch me some roast meat such as the king eats the red fox knew\\nthe byeways better and went by holes and corners without any dog\\nseeing him seated himself under the chair of the kings daughter and\\nscratched her foot then she looked down and recognized the fox by its\\ncollar took him into her chamber with her and said dear fox what\\ndost thou want he answered my master who killed the dragon is\\nhere and has sent me i am to ask for some roast meat such as the king\\nis eating then she made the cook come who was obliged to prepare a\\nroast joint the same as was eaten by the king and to carry it for the\\nfox as far as the door then the fox took the dish waved away with his\\ntail the flies which had settled on the meat and then carried it to\\nhis master behold sir host said the huntsman bread and meat are\\nhere but now i will also have proper vegetables with it such as are\\neaten by the king then he called the wolf and said dear wolf go\\nthither and fetch me vegetables such as the king eats then the wolf\\nwent straight to the palace as he feared no one and when he got to\\nthe kings daughters chamber he twitched at the back of her dress so\\nthat she was forced to look round she recognized him by his collar\\nand took him into her chamber with her and said dear wolf what dost\\nthou want he answered my master who killed the dragon is here i\\nam to ask for some vegetables such as the king eats then she made\\nthe cook come and he had to make ready a dish of vegetables such as\\nthe king ate and had to carry it for the wolf as far as the door and\\nthen the wolf took the dish from him and carried it to his master\\nbehold sir host said the huntsman now i have bread and meat and\\nvegetables but i will also have some pastry to eat like that which the\\nking eats he called the bear and said dear bear thou art fond of\\nlicking anything sweet go and bring me some confectionery such as the\\nking eats then the bear trotted to the palace and every one got out\\nof his way but when he went to the guard they presented their\\nmuskets and would not let him go into the royal palace but he got up\\non his hind legs and gave them a few boxes on the ears right and\\nleft with his paws so that the whole watch broke up and then he went\\nstraight to the kings daughter placed himself behind her and growled\\na little then she looked behind her knew the bear and bade him go\\ninto her room with her and said dear bear what dost thou want he\\nanswered my master who killed the dragon is here and i am to ask\\nfor some confectionery such as the king eats then she summoned her\\nconfectioner who had to bake confectionery such as the king ate and\\ncarry it to the door for the bear then the bear first licked up the\\ncomfits which had rolled down and then he stood upright took the\\ndish and carried it to his master behold sir host said the\\nhuntsman now i have bread meat vegetables and confectionery but i\\nwill drink wine also and such as the king drinks he called his lion\\nto him and said dear lion thou thyself likest to drink till thou art\\nintoxicated go and fetch me some wine such as is drunk by the king\\nthen the lion strode through the streets and the people fled from him\\nand when he came to the watch they wanted to bar the way against him\\nbut he did but roar once and they all ran away then the lion went to\\nthe royal apartment and knocked at the door with his tail then the\\nkings daughter came forth and was almost afraid of the lion but she\\nknew him by the golden clasp of her necklace and bade him go with her\\ninto her chamber and said dear lion what wilt thou have he\\nanswered my master who killed the dragon is here and i am to ask\\nfor some wine such as is drunk by the king then she bade the\\ncupbearer be called who was to give the lion some wine like that\\nwhich was drunk by the king the lion said i will go with him and\\nsee that i get the right wine then he went down with the cupbearer\\nand when they were below the cupbearer wanted to draw him some of the\\ncommon wine that was drunk by the kings servants but the lion said\\nstop i will taste the wine first and he drew half a measure and\\nswallowed it down at one draught no said he that is not right\\nthe cupbearer looked at him askance but went on and was about to\\ngive him some out of another barrel which was for the kings marshal\\nthe lion said stop let me taste the wine first and drew half a\\nmeasure and drank it that is better but still not right said he\\nthen the cupbearer grew angry and said how can a stupid animal like\\nyou understand wine but the lion gave him a blow behind the ears\\nwhich made him fall down by no means gently and when he had got up\\nagain he conducted the lion quite silently into a little cellar apart\\nwhere the kings wine lay from which no one ever drank the lion first\\ndrew half a measure and tried the wine and then he said that may\\npossibly be the right sort and bade the cupbearer fill six bottles of\\nit and now they went upstairs again but when the lion came out of the\\ncellar into the open air he reeled here and there and was rather\\ndrunk and the cupbearer was forced to carry the wine as far as the\\ndoor for him and then the lion took the handle of the basket in his\\nmouth and took it to his master the huntsman said behold sir host\\nhere have i bread meat vegetables confectionery and wine such as the\\nking has and now i will dine with my animals and he sat down and ate\\nand drank and gave the hare the fox the wolf the bear and the lion\\nalso to eat and to drink and was joyful for he saw that the kings\\ndaughter still loved him and when he had finished his dinner he said\\nsir host now have i eaten and drunk as the king eats and drinks and\\nnow i will go to the kings court and marry the kings daughter said\\nthe host how can that be when she already has a betrothed husband\\nand when the wedding is to be solemnized today then the huntsman\\ndrew forth the handkerchief which the kings daughter had given him on\\nthe dragons hill and in which were folded the monsters seven\\ntongues and said that which i hold in my hand shall help me to do\\nit then the innkeeper looked at the handkerchief and said whatever\\ni believe i do not believe that and i am willing to stake my house\\nand courtyard on it the huntsman however took a bag with a thousand\\ngold pieces put it on the table and said i stake that on it\\n\\nnow the king said to his daughter at the royal table what did all\\nthe wild animals want which have been coming to thee and going in and\\nout of my palace she replied i may not tell you but send and have\\nthe master of these animals brought and you will do well the king\\nsent a servant to the inn and invited the stranger and the servant\\ncame just as the huntsman had laid his wager with the innkeeper then\\nsaid he behold sir host now the king sends his servant and invites\\nme but i do not go in this way and he said to the servant i\\nrequest the lord king to send me royal clothing and a carriage with\\nsix horses and servants to attend me when the king heard the answer\\nhe said to his daughter what shall i do she said cause him to be\\nfetched as he desires to be and you will do well then the king sent\\nroyal apparel a carriage with six horses and servants to wait on him\\nwhen the huntsman saw them coming he said behold sir host now i am\\nfetched as i desired to be and he put on the royal garments took the\\nhandkerchief with the dragons tongues with him and drove off to the\\nking when the king saw him coming he said to his daughter how shall\\ni receive him she answered go to meet him and you will do well\\nthen the king went to meet him and led him in and his animals\\nfollowed the king gave him a seat near himself and his daughter and\\nthe marshal as bridegroom sat on the other side but no longer knew\\nthe huntsman and now at this very moment the seven heads of the\\ndragon were brought in as a spectacle and the king said the seven\\nheads were cut off the dragon by the marshal wherefore today i give\\nhim my daughter to wife the the huntsman stood up opened the seven\\nmouths and said where are the seven tongues of the dragon then was\\nthe marshal terrified and grew pale and knew not what answer he should\\nmake and at length in his anguish he said dragons have no tongues\\nthe huntsman said liars ought to have none but the dragons tongues\\nare the tokens of the victor and he unfolded the handkerchief and\\nthere lay all seven inside it and he put each tongue in the mouth to\\nwhich it belonged and it fitted exactly then he took the handkerchief\\non which the name of the princess was embroidered and showed it to the\\nmaiden and asked to whom she had given it and she replied to him\\nwho killed the dragon and then he called his animals and took the\\ncollar off each of them and the golden clasp from the lion and showed\\nthem to the maiden and asked to whom they belonged she answered the\\nnecklace and golden clasp were mine but i divided them among the\\nanimals who helped to conquer the dragon then spake the huntsman\\nwhen i tired with the fight was resting and sleeping the marshal\\ncame and cut off my head then he carried away the kings daughter and\\ngave out that it was he who had killed the dragon but that he lied i\\nprove with the tongues the handkerchief and the necklace and then\\nhe related how his animals had healed him by means of a wonderful root\\nand how he had travelled about with them for one year and had at\\nlength again come there and had learnt the treachery of the marshal by\\nthe innkeepers story then the king asked his daughter is it true\\nthat this man killed the dragon and she answered yes it is true\\nnow can i reveal the wicked deed of the marshal as it has come to\\nlight without my connivance for he wrung from me a promise to be\\nsilent for this reason however did i make the condition that the\\nmarriage should not be solemnized for a year and a day then the king\\nbade twelve councillors be summoned who were to pronounce judgment on\\nthe marshal and they sentenced him to be torn to pieces by four bulls\\nthe marshal was therefore executed but the king gave his daughter to\\nthe huntsman and named him his viceroy over the whole kingdom the\\nwedding was celebrated with great joy and the young king caused his\\nfather and his fosterfather to be brought and loaded them with\\ntreasures neither did he forget the innkeeper but sent for him and\\nsaid behold sir host i have married the kings daughter and your\\nhouse and yard are mine the host said yes according to justice it\\nis so but the young king said it shall be done according to mercy\\nand told him that he should keep his house and yard and gave him the\\nthousand pieces of gold as well\\n\\nand now the young king and queen were thoroughly happy and lived in\\ngladness together he often went out hunting because it was a delight\\nto him and the faithful animals had to accompany him in the\\nneighborhood however there was a forest of which it was reported that\\nit was haunted and that whosoever did but enter it did not easily get\\nout again the young king however had a great inclination to hunt in\\nit and let the old king have no peace until he allowed him to do so\\nso he rode forth with a great following and when he came to the\\nforest he saw a snowwhite hart and said to his people wait here\\nuntil i return i want to chase that beautiful creature and he rode\\ninto the forest after it followed only by his animals the attendants\\nhalted and waited until evening but he did not return so they rode\\nhome and told the young queen that the young king had followed a white\\nhart into the enchanted forest and had not come back again then she\\nwas in the greatest concern about him he however had still continued\\nto ride on and on after the beautiful wild animal and had never been\\nable to overtake it when he thought he was near enough to aim he\\ninstantly saw it bound away into the far distance and at length it\\nvanished altogether and now he perceived that he had penetrated deep\\ninto the forest and blew his horn but he received no answer for his\\nattendants could not hear it and as night too was falling he saw\\nthat he could not get home that day so he dismounted from his horse\\nlighted himself a fire near a tree and resolved to spend the night by\\nit while he was sitting by the fire and his animals also were lying\\ndown beside him it seemed to him that he heard a human voice he\\nlooked round but could perceived nothing soon afterwards he again\\nheard a groan as if from above and then he looked up and saw an old\\nwoman sitting in the tree who wailed unceasingly oh oh oh how\\ncold i am said he come down and warm thyself if thou art cold\\nbut she said no thy animals will bite me he answered they will\\ndo thee no harm old mother do come down she however was a witch\\nand said i will throw down a wand from the tree and if thou strikest\\nthem on the back with it they will do me no harm then she threw him\\na small wand and he struck them with it and instantly they lay still\\nand were turned into stone and when the witch was safe from the\\nanimals she leapt down and touched him also with a wand and changed\\nhim to stone thereupon she laughed and dragged him and the animals\\ninto a vault where many more such stones already lay\\n\\nas however the young king did not come back at all the queens\\nanguish and care grew constantly greater and it so happened that at\\nthis very time the other brother who had turned to the east when they\\nseparated came into the kingdom he had sought a situation and had\\nfound none and had then travelled about here and there and had made\\nhis animals dance then it came into his mind that he would just go and\\nlook at the knife that they had thrust in the trunk of a tree at their\\nparting that he might learn how his brother was when he got there his\\nbrothers side of the knife was half rusted and half bright then he\\nwas alarmed and thought a great misfortune must have befallen my\\nbrother but perhaps i can still save him for half the knife is still\\nbright he and his animals travelled towards the west and when he\\nentered the gate of the town the guard came to meet him and asked if\\nhe was to announce him to his consort the young queen who had for a\\ncouple of days been in the greatest sorrow about his staying away and\\nwas afraid he had been killed in the enchanted forest the sentries\\nindeed thought no otherwise than that he was the young king himself\\nfor he looked so like him and had wild animals running behind him\\nthen he saw that they were speaking of his brother and thought it\\nwill be better if i pass myself off for him and then i can rescue him\\nmore easily so he allowed himself to be escorted into the castle by\\nthe guard and was received with the greatest joy the young queen\\nindeed thought that he was her husband and asked him why he had stayed\\naway so long he answered i had lost myself in a forest and could\\nnot find my way out again any sooner at night he was taken to the\\nroyal bed but he laid a twoedged sword between him and the young\\nqueen she did not know what that could mean but did not venture to\\nask\\n\\nhe remained in the palace a couple of days and in the meantime\\ninquired into everything which related to the enchanted forest and at\\nlast he said i must hunt there once more the king and the young\\nqueen wanted to persuade him not to do it but he stood out against\\nthem and went forth with a larger following when he had got into the\\nforest it fared with him as with his brother he saw a white hart and\\nsaid to his people stay here and wait until i return i want to\\nchase the lovely wild beast and then he rode into the forest and his\\nanimals ran after him but he could not overtake the hart and got so\\ndeep into the forest that he was forced to pass the night there and\\nwhen he had lighted a fire he heard some one wailing above him oh\\noh oh how cold i am then he looked up and the selfsame witch was\\nsitting in the tree said he if thou art cold come down little old\\nmother and warm thyself she answered no thy animals will bite\\nme but he said they will not hurt thee then she cried i will\\nthrow down a wand to thee and if thou smitest them with it they will\\ndo me no harm when the huntsman heard that he had no confidence in\\nthe old woman and said i will not strike my animals come down or i\\nwill fetch thee then she cried what dost thou want thou shalt not\\ntouch me but he replied if thou dost not come i will shoot thee\\nsaid she shoot away i do not fear thy bullets then he aimed and\\nfired at her but the witch was proof against all leaden bullets and\\nlaughed and yelled and cried thou shalt not hit me the huntsman\\nknew what to do tore three silver buttons off his coat and loaded his\\ngun with them for against them her arts were useless and when he\\nfired she fell down at once with a scream then he set his foot on her\\nand said old witch if thou dost not instantly confess where my\\nbrother is i will seize thee with both my hands and throw thee into\\nthe fire she was in a great fright begged for mercy and said he and\\nhis animals lie in a vault turned to stone then he compelled her to\\ngo thither with him threatened her and said old seacat now shalt\\nthou make my brother and all the human beings lying here alive again\\nor thou shalt go into the fire she took a wand and touched the stones\\nand then his brother with his animals came to life again and many\\nothers merchants artizans and shepherds arose thanked him for\\ntheir deliverance and went to their homes but when the twin brothers\\nsaw each other again they kissed each other and rejoiced with all\\ntheir hearts then they seized the witch bound her and laid her on the\\nfire and when she was burnt the forest opened of its own accord and\\nwas light and clear and the kings palace could be seen at about the\\ndistance of a three hours walk\\n\\nthereupon the two brothers went home together and on the way told each\\nother their histories and when the youngest said that he was ruler of\\nthe whole country in the kings stead the other observed that i\\nremarked very well for when i came to the town and was taken for\\nthee all royal honours were paid me the young queen looked on me as\\nher husband and i had to eat at her side and sleep in thy bed when\\nthe other heard that he became so jealous and angry that he drew his\\nsword and struck off his brothers head but when he

same\\ntime from the two sides in the aged kings presence so they\\nseparated and at the same time came the watchmen from the one door and\\nfrom the other and announced that the young king and the animals had\\nreturned from the chase the king said it is not possible the gates\\nlie quite a mile apart in the meantime however the two brothers\\nentered the courtyard of the palace from opposite sides and both\\nmounted the steps then the king said to the daughter say which is\\nthy husband each of them looks exactly like the other i cannot tell\\nthen she was in great distress and could not tell but at last she\\nremembered the necklace which she had given to the animals and she\\nsought for and found her little golden clasp on the lion and she cried\\nin her delight he who is followed by this lion is my true husband\\nthen the young king laughed and said yes he is the right one and\\nthey sat down together to table and ate and drank and were merry at\\nnight when the young king went to bed his wife said why hast thou\\nfor these last nights always laid a twoedged sword in our bed i\\nthought thou hadst a wish to kill me then he knew how true his\\nbrother had been',\n",
       " 'there was a certain village wherein no one lived but really rich\\npeasants and just one poor one whom they called the little peasant\\nhe had not even so much as a cow and still less money to buy one and\\nyet he and his wife did so wish to have one one day he said to her\\nhark you i have a good thought there is our gossip the carpenter he\\nshall make us a wooden calf and paint it brown so that it look like\\nany other and in time it will certainly get big and be a cow the\\nwoman also liked the idea and their gossip the carpenter cut and\\nplaned the calf and painted it as it ought to be and made it with its\\nhead hanging down as if it were eating\\n\\nnext morning when the cows were being driven out the little peasant\\ncalled the cowherd and said look i have a little calf there but it\\nis still small and has still to be carried the cowherd said all\\nright and took it in his arms and carried it to the pasture and set\\nit among the grass the little calf always remained standing like one\\nwhich was eating and the cowherd said it will soon run alone just\\nlook how it eats already at night when he was going to drive the herd\\nhome again he said to the calf if thou canst stand there and eat thy\\nfill thou canst also go on thy four legs i dont care to drag thee\\nhome again in my arms but the little peasant stood at his door and\\nwaited for his little calf and when the cowherd drove the cows\\nthrough the village and the calf was missing he inquired where it\\nwas the cowherd answered it is still standing out there eating it\\nwould not stop and come with us but the little peasant said oh but\\ni must have my beast back again then they went back to the meadow\\ntogether but some one had stolen the calf and it was gone the\\ncowherd said it must have run away the peasant however said\\ndont tell me that and led the cowherd before the mayor who for\\nhis carelessness condemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf\\nwhich had run away\\n\\nand now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which they had\\nso long wished and they were heartily glad but they had no food for\\nit and could give it nothing to eat so it soon had to be killed they\\nsalted the flesh and the peasant went into the town and wanted to sell\\nthe skin there so that he might buy a new calf with the proceeds on\\nthe way he passed by a mill and there sat a raven with broken wings\\nand out of pity he took him and wrapped him in the skin as however\\nthe weather grew so bad and there was a storm of rain and wind he\\ncould go no farther and turned back to the mill and begged for\\nshelter the millers wife was alone in the house and said to the\\npeasant lay thyself on the straw there and gave him a slice of\\nbread with cheese on it the peasant ate it and lay down with his skin\\nbeside him and the woman thought he is tired and has gone to sleep\\nin the meantime came the parson the millers wife received him well\\nand said my husband is out so we will have a feast the peasant\\nlistened and when he heard about feasting he was vexed that he had\\nbeen forced to make shift with a slice of bread with cheese on it then\\nthe woman served up four different things roast meat salad cakes\\nand wine\\n\\njust as they were about to sit down and eat there was a knocking\\noutside the woman said oh heavens it is my husband she quickly\\nhid the roast meat inside the tiled stove the wine under the pillow\\nthe salad on the bed the cakes under it and the parson in the\\ncupboard in the entrance then she opened the door for her husband and\\nsaid thank heaven thou art back again there is such a storm it\\nlooks as if the world were coming to an end the miller saw the\\npeasant lying on the straw and asked what is that fellow doing\\nthere ah said the wife the poor knave came in the storm and\\nrain and begged for shelter so i gave him a bit of bread and cheese\\nand showed him where the straw was the man said i have no\\nobjection but be quick and get me something to eat the woman said\\nbut i have nothing but bread and cheese i am contented with\\nanything replied the husband so far as i am concerned bread and\\ncheese will do and looked at the peasant and said come and eat some\\nmore with me the peasant did not require to be invited twice but got\\nup and ate after this the miller saw the skin in which the raven was\\nlying on the ground and asked what hast thou there the peasant\\nanswered i have a soothsayer inside it can he foretell anything to\\nme said the miller why not answered the peasant but he only\\nsays four things and the fifth he keeps to himself the miller was\\ncurious and said let him foretell something for once then the\\npeasant pinched the ravens head so that he croaked and made a noise\\nlike krr krr the miller said what did he say the peasant\\nanswered in the first place he says that there is some wine hidden\\nunder the pillow bless me cried the miller and went there and\\nfound the wine now go on said he the peasant made the raven croak\\nagain and said in the second place he says that there is some roast\\nmeat in the tiled stove upon my word cried the miller and went\\nthither and found the roast meat the peasant made the raven prophesy\\nstill more and said thirdly he says that there is some salad on the\\nbed that would be a fine thing cried the miller and went there\\nand found the salad at last the peasant pinched the raven once more\\ntill he croaked and said fourthly he says that there are some cakes\\nunder the bed that would be a fine thing cried the miller and\\nlooked there and found the cakes\\n\\nand now the two sat down to the table together but the millers wife\\nwas frightened to death and went to bed and took all the keys with\\nher the miller would have liked much to know the fifth but the little\\npeasant said first we will quickly eat the four things for the\\nfifth is something bad so they ate and after that they bargained how\\nmuch the miller was to give for the fifth prophesy until they agreed\\non three hundred thalers then the peasant once more pinched the\\nravens head till he croaked loudly the miller asked what did he\\nsay the peasant replied he says that the devil is hiding outside\\nthere in the cupboard in the entrance the miller said the devil\\nmust go out and opened the housedoor then the woman was forced to\\ngive up the keys and the peasant unlocked the cupboard the parson ran\\nout as fast as he could and the miller said it was true i saw the\\nblack rascal with my own eyes the peasant however made off next\\nmorning by daybreak with the three hundred thalers\\n\\nat home the small peasant gradually launched out he built a beautiful\\nhouse and the peasants said the small peasant has certainly been to\\nthe place where golden snow falls and people carry the gold home in\\nshovels then the small peasant was brought before the mayor and\\nbidden to say from whence his wealth came he answered i sold my\\ncows skin in the town for three hundred thalers when the peasants\\nheard that they too wished to enjoy this great profit and ran home\\nkilled all their cows and stripped off their skins in order to sell\\nthem in the town to the greatest advantage the mayor however said\\nbut my servant must go first when she came to the merchant in the\\ntown he did not give her more than two thalers for a skin and when\\nthe others came he did not give them so much and said what can i do\\nwith all these skins\\n\\nthen the peasants were vexed that the small peasant should have thus\\noverreached them wanted to take vengeance on him and accused him of\\nthis treachery before the mayor the innocent little peasant was\\nunanimously sentenced to death and was to be rolled into the water in\\na barrel pierced full of holes he was led forth and a priest was\\nbrought who was to say a mass for his soul the others were all obliged\\nto retire to a distance and when the peasant looked at the priest he\\nrecognized the man who had been with the millers wife he said to him\\ni set you free from the cupboard set me free from the barrel at\\nthis same moment up came with a flock of sheep the very shepherd who\\nas the peasant knew had long been wishing to be mayor so he cried with\\nall his might no i will not do it if the whole world insists on it\\ni will not do it the shepherd hearing that came up to him and\\nasked what art thou about what is it that thou wilt not do the\\npeasant said they want to make me mayor if i will but put myself in\\nthe barrel but i will not do it the shepherd said if nothing more\\nthan that is needful in order to be mayor i would get into the barrel\\nat once the peasant said if thou wilt get in thou wilt be mayor\\nthe shepherd was willing and got in and the peasant shut the top down\\non him then he took the shepherds flock for himself and drove it\\naway the parson went to the crowd and declared that the mass had been\\nsaid then they came and rolled the barrel towards the water when the\\nbarrel began to roll the shepherd cried i am quite willing to be\\nmayor they believed no otherwise than that it was the peasant who was\\nsaying this and answered that is what we intend but first thou\\nshalt look about thee a little down below there and they rolled the\\nbarrel down into the water\\n\\nafter that the peasants went home and as they were entering the\\nvillage the small peasant also came quietly in driving a flock of\\nsheep and looking quite contented then the peasants were astonished\\nand said peasant from whence comest thou hast thou come out of the\\nwater yes truly replied the peasant i sank deep deep down\\nuntil at last i got to the bottom i pushed the bottom out of the\\nbarrel and crept out and there were pretty meadows on which a number\\nof lambs were feeding and from thence i brought this flock away with\\nme said the peasants are there any more there oh yes said he\\nmore than i could do anything with then the peasants made up their\\nminds that they too would fetch some sheep for themselves a flock\\napiece but the mayor said i come first so they went to the water\\ntogether and just then there were some of the small fleecy clouds in\\nthe blue sky which are called little lambs and they were reflected in\\nthe water whereupon the peasants cried we already see the sheep down\\nbelow the mayor pressed forward and said i will go down first and\\nlook about me and if things promise well ill call you so he jumped\\nin splash went the water he made a sound as if he were calling them\\nand the whole crowd plunged in after him as one man then the entire\\nvillage was dead and the small peasant as sole heir became a rich\\nman',\n",

which the soup was served\\nwhen the dancing was over the king had his soup brought and ate it\\nand he liked it so much that it seemed to him he had never tasted\\nbetter but when he came to the bottom of the bowl he saw a golden\\nring lying and could not conceive how it could have got there then he\\nordered the cook to appear before him the cook was terrified when he\\nheard the order and said to allerleirauh thou hast certainly let a\\nhair fall into the soup and if thou hast thou shalt be beaten for\\nit when he came before the king the latter asked who had made the\\nsoup the cook replied i made it but the king said that is not\\ntrue for it was much better than usual and cooked differently he\\nanswered i must acknowledge that i did not make it it was made by\\nthe rough animal the king said go and bid it come up here\\n\\nwhen allerleirauh came the king said who art thou i am a poor\\ngirl who no longer has any father or mother he asked further of\\nwhat use art thou in my palace she answered i am good for nothing\\nbut to have boots thrown at my head he continued where didst thou\\nget the ring which was in the soup she answered i know nothing\\nabout the ring so the king could learn nothing and had to send her\\naway again\\n\\nafter a while there was another festival and then as before\\nallerleirauh begged the cook for leave to go and look on he answered\\nyes but come back again in halfanhour and make the king the bread\\nsoup which he so much likes then she ran into her den washed herself\\nquickly and took out of the nut the dress which was as silvery as the\\nmoon and put it on then she went up and was like a princess and the\\nking stepped forward to meet her and rejoiced to see her once more\\nand as the dance was just beginning they danced it together but when\\nit was ended she again disappeared so quickly that the king could not\\nobserve where she went she however sprang into her den and once\\nmore made herself a hairy animal and went into the kitchen to prepare\\nthe bread soup when the cook had gone upstairs she fetched the\\nlittle golden spinningwheel and put it in the bowl so that the soup\\ncovered it then it was taken to the king who ate it and liked it as\\nmuch as before and had the cook brought who this time likewise was\\nforced to confess that allerleirauh had prepared the soup allerleirauh\\nagain came before the king but she answered that she was good for\\nnothing else but to have boots thrown at her head and that she knew\\nnothing at all about the little golden spinningwheel\\n\\nwhen for the third time the king held a festival all happened just\\nas it had done before the cook said faith roughskin thou art a\\nwitch and always puttest something in the soup which makes it so good\\nthat the king likes it better than that which i cook but as she\\nbegged so hard he let her go up at the appointed time and now she put\\non the dress which shone like the stars and thus entered the hall\\nagain the king danced with the beautiful maiden and thought that she\\nnever yet had been so beautiful and whilst she was dancing he\\ncontrived without her noticing it to slip a golden ring on her\\nfinger and he had given orders that the dance should last a very long\\ntime when it was ended he wanted to hold her fast by her hands but\\nshe tore herself loose and sprang away so quickly through the crowd\\nthat she vanished from his sight she ran as fast as she could into her\\nden beneath the stairs but as she had been too long and had stayed\\nmore than halfanhour she could not take off her pretty dress but\\nonly threw over it her furmantle and in her haste she did not make\\nherself quite black but one finger remained white then allerleirauh\\nran into the kitchen and cooked the bread soup for the king and as\\nthe cook was away put her golden reel into it when the king found the\\nreel at the bottom of it he caused allerleirauh to be summoned and\\nthen he espied the white finger and saw the ring which he had put on\\nit during the dance then he grasped her by the hand and held her\\nfast and when she wanted to release herself and run away her mantle\\nof fur opened a little and the stardress shone forth the king\\nclutched the mantle and tore it off then her golden hair shone forth\\nand she stood there in full splendour and could no longer hide\\nherself and when she had washed the soot and ashes from her face she\\nwas more beautiful than anyone who had ever been seen on earth but the\\nking said thou art my dear bride and we will never more part from\\neach other thereupon the marriage was solemnized and they lived\\nhappily until their death',\n",

the\\nwell and was hurrying back with her pitcher full of water and when\\nshe saw the runner lying there asleep she was glad and said my enemy\\nis delivered over into my hands emptied his pitcher and ran on and\\nnow all would have been lost if by good luck the huntsman had not been\\nstanding at the top of the castle and had not seen everything with his\\nsharp eyes then said he the kings

the six who were sitting at table began to feel quite warm\\nand they thought the heat was caused by the food but as it became\\nstill greater and they wanted to get out and found that the doors

and i will not ask for your daughter\\n\\non this the king was satisfied and the other continued in fourteen\\ndays i will come and fetch it thereupon he summoned together all the\\ntailors in the whole kingdom and they were to sit for fourteen days\\nand sew a sack and when it was ready the strong one who could tear up\\ntrees had to take it on his back and go with it to the king then said\\nthe king who can that strong fellow be who is carrying a bundle of\\nlinen on his back that is as big as a house and he was alarmed and\\nsaid what a lot of gold he can carry away then he commanded a ton\\nof gold to be brought it took sixteen of his strongest men to carry\\nit but the strong one snatched it up in one hand put it in his sack\\nand said why dont you bring more at the same time that hardly\\ncovers the bottom then little by little the king caused all his\\ntreasure to be brought thither and the strong one pushed it into the\\nsack and still the sack was not half full with it bring more cried\\nhe these few crumbs dont fill it then seven thousand carts with\\ngold had to be gathered together in the whole kingdom and the strong\\none thrust them and the oxen harnessed to them into his sack i will\\nexamine it no longer said he but will just take what comes so long\\nas the sack is but full when all that was inside there was still\\nroom for a great deal

how one single man was carrying away the entire wealth of\\nthe country he became enraged and bade his horsemen mount and pursue\\nthe six and ordered them to take the sack away from the strong one\\ntwo regiments speedily overtook the six and called out you are\\nprisoners put down the sack with the gold or you will all be cut to\\npieces what say you cried the blower that we are prisoners\\nrather than that should happen all of you shall dance about in the\\nair and he closed one nostril and with the other blew on the two\\nregiments then they were driven away from each other

stopped a little so that\\nhe came down without injury and then the blower said to him now go\\nhome to thy king and tell him he had better send some more horsemen\\nand i will blow them all into the

him he fell into a passion and ordered him to be cast into\\nthe deepest dungeon then the huntsman spoke further and said father\\nwill you see the maiden who brought me up so tenderly and who

one kreuzer with that he went into an inn ate the\\nbread and ordered one kreuzers worth of beer when he had had it he\\njourneyed onwards and then st peter who had assumed the appearance\\nof a discharged soldier met and spoke to him thus good day comrade\\ncanst thou not give me a bit of bread and a kreuzer to get a drink\\nwhere am i to procure it answered brother lustig i have been\\ndischarged and i got nothing but a loaf of ammunitionbread and four\\nkreuzers in money i met three beggars on the road and i gave each of\\nthem a quarter of my bread and one kreuzer the last quarter i ate in\\nthe inn and had a drink with the last kreuzer now my pockets are\\nempty and if thou also hast nothing we can go abegging together\\nno answered st peter we need not quite do that i know a little\\nabout medicine and i will soon earn as much as i require by that\\nindeed said brother lustig i know nothing of that so i must go\\nand beg alone just come with me said st peter and if i earn\\nanything thou shalt have half of it all right said brother\\nlustig so they went away together\\n\\nthen they came to a peasants house inside which they heard loud\\nlamentations and cries so they went in and there the husband was\\nlying sick unto death and very near his end and his wife was crying\\nand weeping quite loudly stop that howling and crying said st\\npeter i will make the man well again and he took a salve out of his\\npocket and healed the sick man in a moment so that he could get up\\nand was in perfect health in great delight the man and his wife said\\nhow can we reward you what shall we give you but st peter would\\ntake nothing and the more the peasant folks offered him the more he\\nrefused brother lustig however nudged st peter and said take\\nsomething sure enough we are in need of it at length the woman\\nbrought a lamb and said to st peter that he really must take that but\\nhe would not then brother lustig gave him a poke in the side and\\nsaid do take it you stupid fool we are in great want of it then\\nst peter said at last well i will take the lamb but i wont carry\\nit if thou wilt insist on having it thou must carry it that is\\nnothing said brother lustig i will easily carry it and took it on\\nhis shoulder then they departed and came to a wood but brother lustig\\nhad begun to feel the lamb heavy and he was hungry so he said to st\\npeter look thats a good place we might cook the lamb there and\\neat it as you like answered st peter but i cant have anything\\nto do with the cooking if thou wilt cook there is a kettle for thee\\nand in the meantime i will walk about a little until it is ready thou\\nmust however not begin to eat until i have come back i will come at\\nthe right time well go then said brother lustig i understand\\ncookery i will manage it then st peter went away and brother\\nlustig killed the lamb lighted a fire threw the meat into the kettle\\nand boiled it the lamb was however quite ready and the apostle\\npeter had not come back so brother lustig took it out of the kettle\\ncut it up and found the heart that is said to be the best part\\nsaid he and tasted it but at last he ate it all up at length st\\npeter returned and said thou mayst eat the whole of the lamb thyself\\ni will only have the heart give me that then brother lustig took a\\nknife and fork and pretended to look anxiously about amongst the\\nlambs flesh but not to be able to find the heart and at last he said\\nabruptly there is none here but where can it be said the\\napostle i dont know replied brother lustig but look what fools\\nwe both are to seek for the lambs heart and neither of us to\\nremember that a lamb has no heart oh said st peter that is\\nsomething quite new every animal has a heart why is a lamb to have\\nnone no be assured my brother said brother lustig that a lamb\\nhas no heart just consider it seriously and then you will see that it\\nreally has none well it is all right said st peter if there is\\nno heart then i want none of the lamb thou mayst eat it alone what\\ni cant eat now i will carry away in my knapsack said brother\\nlustig and he ate half the lamb and put the rest in his knapsack\\n\\nthey went farther and then st peter caused a great stream of water to\\nflow right across their path and they were obliged to pass through it\\nsaid st peter do thou go first no answered brother lustig\\nthou must go first and he thought if the water is too deep i will\\nstay behind then st peter strode through it and the water just\\nreached to his knee so brother lustig began to go through also but\\nthe water grew deeper and reached to his throat then he cried\\nbrother help me st peter said then wilt thou confess that thou\\nhast eaten the lambs heart no said he i have not eaten it\\nthen the water grew deeper still and rose to his mouth help me\\nbrother cried the soldier st peter said then wilt thou confess\\nthat thou hast eaten the lambs heart no he replied i have not\\neaten it st peter however would not let him be drowned but made\\nthe water sink and helped him through it\\n\\nthen they journeyed onwards and came to a kingdom where they heard\\nthat the kings daughter lay sick unto death hollo brother said\\nthe soldier to st peter this is a chance for us if we can heal her\\nwe shall be provided for for life but st peter was not half quick\\nenough for him come lift your legs my dear brother said he that\\nwe may get there in time but st peter walked slower and slower\\nthough brother lustig did all he could to drive and push him on and at\\nlast they heard that the princess was dead now we are done for said\\nbrother lustig that comes of thy sleepy way of walking just be\\nquiet answered st peter i can do more than cure sick people i can\\nbring dead ones to life again well if thou canst do that said\\nbrother lustig its all right but thou shouldst earn at least half\\nthe kingdom for us by that then they went to the royal palace where\\nevery one was in great grief but st peter told the king that he would\\nrestore his daughter to life he was taken to her and said bring me\\na kettle and some water and when that was brought he bade everyone\\ngo out and allowed no one to remain with him but brother lustig then\\nhe cut off all the dead girls limbs and threw them in the water\\nlighted a fire beneath the kettle and boiled them and when the flesh\\nhad fallen away from the bones he took out the beautiful white bones\\nand laid them on a table and arranged them together in their natural\\norder when he had done that he stepped forward and said three times\\nin the name of the holy trinity dead woman arise and at the third\\ntime the princess arose living healthy and beautiful then the king\\nwas in the greatest joy and said to st peter ask for thy reward\\neven if it were half my kingdom i would give it thee but st peter\\nsaid i want nothing for it oh thou tomfool thought brother\\nlustig to himself and nudged his comrades side and said dont be\\nso stupid if thou hast no need of anything i have st peter\\nhowever would have nothing but as the king saw that the other would\\nvery much like to have something he ordered his treasurer to fill\\nbrother lustigs knapsack with gold then they went on their way and\\nwhen they came to a forest st peter said to brother lustig now we\\nwill divide the gold yes he replied we will so st peter\\ndivided the gold and divided it into three heaps brother lustig\\nthought to himself what craze has he got in his head now he is\\nmaking three shares and there are only two of us but st peter said\\ni have divided it exactly there is one share for me one for thee\\nand one for him who ate the lambs heart\\n\\noh i ate that replied brother lustig and hastily swept up the\\ngold you may trust what i say but how can that be true said st\\npeter when a lamb has no heart eh what brother what can you be\\nthinking of lambs have hearts like other animals why should only they\\nhave none well so be it said st peter keep the gold to\\nyourself but i will stay with you no longer i will go my way alone\\nas you like dear brother answered brother lustig farewell\\n\\nthen st peter went a different road but brother lustig thought it\\nis a good thing that he has taken himself off he is certainly a\\nstrange saint after all then he had money enough but did not know\\nhow to manage it squandered it gave it away and and when some time\\nhad gone by once more had nothing then he arrived in a certain\\ncountry where he heard that a kings daughter was dead oh ho\\nthought he that may be a good thing for me i will bring her to life\\nagain and see that i am paid as i ought to be so he went to the\\nking and offered to raise the dead girl to life again now the king\\nhad heard that a discharged soldier was traveling about and bringing\\ndead persons to life again and thought that brother lustig was the\\nman but as he had no confidence in him he consulted his councillors\\nfirst who said that he might give it a trial as his daughter was dead\\nthen brother lustig ordered water to be brought to him in a kettle\\nbade every one go out cut the limbs off threw them in the water and\\nlighted a fire beneath just as he had seen st peter do the water\\nbegan to boil the flesh fell off and then he took the bones out and\\nlaid them on the table but he did not know the order in which to lay\\nthem and placed them all wrong and in confusion then he stood before\\nthem and said in the name of the most holy trinity dead maiden i\\nbid thee arise and he said this thrice but the bones did not stir\\nso he said it thrice more but also in vain confounded girl that you\\nare get up cried he get up or it shall be worse for you when he\\nhad said that st peter suddenly appeared in his former shape as a\\ndischarged soldier he entered by the window and said godless man\\nwhat art thou doing how can the dead maiden arise when thou hast\\nthrown about her bones in such confusion dear brother i have done\\neverything to the best of my ability he answered this once i will\\nhelp thee out of thy difficulty but one thing i tell thee and that is\\nthat if ever thou undertakest anything of the kind again it will be\\nthe worse for thee and also that thou must neither demand nor accept\\nthe smallest thing from the king for this thereupon st peter laid\\nthe bones in their right order said to the maiden three times in the\\nname of the most holy trinity dead maiden arise and the kings\\ndaughter arose healthy and beautiful as before then st peter went\\naway again by the window and brother lustig was rejoiced to find that\\nall had passed off so well but was very much vexed to think that after\\nall he was not to take anything for it i should just like to know\\nthought he what fancy that fellow has got in his head for what he\\ngives with one hand he takes away with the other there is no sense\\nwhatever in it then the king offered brother lustig whatsoever he\\nwished to have but he did not dare to take anything however by hints\\nand cunning he contrived to make the king order his knapsack to be\\nfilled with gold for him and with that he departed when he got out\\nst peter was standing by the door and said just look what a man\\nthou art did i not forbid thee to take anything and there thou hast\\nthy knapsack full of gold how can i help that answered brother\\nlustig if people will put it in for me well i tell thee this\\nthat if ever thou settest about anything of this kind again thou shalt\\nsuffer for it eh brother have no fear now i have money why\\nshould i trouble myself with washing bones faith said st peter\\nthe gold will last a long time in order that after this thou mayst\\nnever tread in forbidden paths i will bestow on thy knapsack this\\nproperty namely that whatsoever thou wishest to have inside it shall\\nbe there farewell thou wilt now never see me more goodbye said\\nbrother lustig and thought to himself i am very glad that thou hast\\ntaken thyself off thou strange fellow i shall certainly not follow\\nthee but of the magical power which had been bestowed on his\\nknapsack he thought no more\\n\\nbrother lustig travelled about with his money and squandered and\\nwasted what he had as before when at last he had no more than four\\nkreuzers he passed by an inn and thought the money must go and\\nordered three kreuzers worth of wine and one kreuzers worth of bread\\nfor himself as he was sitting there drinking the smell of roast goose\\nmade its way to his nose brother lustig looked about and peeped and\\nsaw that the host had two geese standing in the oven then he\\nremembered that his comrade had said that whatsoever he wished to have\\nin his knapsack should be there so he said oh ho i must try that\\nwith the geese so he went out and when he was outside the door he\\nsaid i wish those two roasted geese out of the oven and in my\\nknapsack and when he had said that he unbuckled it and looked in\\nand there they were inside it ah thats right said he now i am a\\nmade man and went away to a meadow and took out the roast meat when\\nhe was in the midst of his meal two journeymen came up and looked at\\nthe second goose which was not yet touched with hungry eyes brother\\nlustig thought to himself one is enough for me and called the two\\nmen up and said take the goose and eat it to my health they\\nthanked him and went with it to the inn ordered themselves a half\\nbottle of wine and a loaf took out the goose which had been given\\nthem and began to eat the hostess saw them and said to her husband\\nthose two are eating a goose just look and see if it is not one of\\nours out of the oven the landlord ran thither and behold the oven\\nwas empty what cried he you thievish crew you want to eat goose\\nas cheap as that pay for it this moment or i will wash you well with\\ngreen hazelsap the two said we are no thieves a discharged\\nsoldier gave us the goose outside there in the meadow you shall not\\nthrow dust in my eyes that way the soldier was here but he went out by\\nthe door like an honest fellow i looked after him myself you are the\\nthieves and shall pay but as they could not pay he took a stick and\\ncudgeled them out of the house\\n\\nbrother lustig went his way and came to a place where there was a\\nmagnificent castle and not far from it a wretched inn he went to the\\ninn and asked for a nights lodging but the landlord turned him away\\nand said there is no more room here the house is full of noble\\nguests it surprises me that they should come to you and not go to\\nthat splendid castle said brother lustig ah indeed replied the\\nhost but it is no slight matter to sleep there for a night no one\\nwho has tried it so far has ever come out of it alive\\n\\nif others have tried it said brother lustig i will try it too\\n\\nleave it alone said the host it will cost you your neck it\\nwont kill me at once said brother lustig just give me the key and\\nsome good food and wine so the host gave him the key and food and\\nwine and with this brother lustig went into the castle enjoyed his\\nsupper and at length as he was sleepy he lay down on the ground for\\nthere was no bed he soon fell asleep but during the night was\\ndisturbed by a great noise and when he awoke he saw nine ugly devils\\nin the room who had made a circle and were dancing around him\\nbrother lustig said well dance as long as you like but none of you\\nmust come too close but the devils pressed continually nearer to him\\nand almost stepped on his face with their hideous feet stop you\\ndevils ghosts said he but they behaved still worse then brother\\nlustig grew angry and cried hola but i will soon make it quiet\\nand got the leg of a chair and struck out into the midst of them with\\nit but nine devils against one soldier were still too many and when\\nhe struck those in front of him the others seized him behind by the\\nhair and tore it unmercifully devils crew cried he it is\\ngetting too bad but wait into my knapsack all nine of you in an\\ninstant they were in it and then he buckled it up and threw it into a\\ncorner after this all was suddenly quiet and brother lustig lay down\\nagain and slept till it was bright day then came the innkeeper and\\nthe nobleman to whom the castle belonged to see how he had fared but\\nwhen they perceived that he was merry and well they were astonished\\nand asked have the spirits done you no harm then the reason why\\nthey have not answered brother lustig is because i have got the\\nwhole nine of them in my knapsack you may once more inhabit your\\ncastle quite tranquilly none of them will ever haunt it again the\\nnobleman thanked him made him rich presents and begged him to remain\\nin his service and he would provide for him as long as he lived no\\nreplied brother lustig i am used to wandering about i will travel\\nfarther then he went away and entered into a smithy laid the\\nknapsack which contained the nine devils on the anvil and asked the\\nsmith and his apprentices to strike it so they smote with their great\\nhammers with all their strength and the devils uttered howls which\\nwere quite pitiable when he opened the knapsack after this eight of\\nthem were dead but one which had been lying in a fold of it was still\\nalive slipped out and went back again to hell thereupon brother\\nlustig travelled a long time about the world and those who know them\\ncan tell many a story about him but at last he grew old and thought\\nof his end so he went to a hermit who was known to be a pious man and\\nsaid to him i am tired of wandering about and want now to behave in\\nsuch a manner that i shall enter into the kingdom of heaven the\\nhermit replied there are two roads one is broad and pleasant and\\nleads to hell the other is narrow and rough and leads to heaven i\\nshould be a fool thought brother lustig if i were to take the\\nnarrow rough road so he set out and took the broad and pleasant\\nroad and at length came to a great black door which was the door of\\nhell brother lustig knocked and the doorkeeper peeped out to see who\\nwas there but when he saw brother lustig he was terrified for he was\\nthe very same ninth devil who had been shut up in the knapsack and had\\nescaped from it with a black eye so he pushed the bolt in again as\\nquickly as he could ran to the devils lieutenant and said there is\\na fellow outside with a knapsack who wants to come in but as you\\nvalue your lives dont allow him to enter or he will wish the whole of\\nhell into his knapsack he once gave me a frightful hammering when i\\nwas inside it so they called out to brother lustig that he was to go\\naway again for he should not get in there if they wont have me\\nhere thought he i will see if i can find a place for myself in\\nheaven for i must be somewhere so he turned about and went onwards\\nuntil he came to the door of heaven where he knocked st peter was\\nsitting hard by as doorkeeper brother lustig recognised him at once\\nand thought here i find an old friend i shall get on better but\\nst peter said i really believe that thou wantest to come into\\nheaven let me in brother i must get in somewhere if they would\\nhave taken me into hell i should not have come here no said st\\npeter thou shalt not enter then if thou wilt not let me in take\\nthy knapsack back for i will have nothing at all from thee give it\\nhere then said st peter then brother lustig gave him the knapsack\\ninto heaven through the bars and st peter took it and hung it beside\\nhis seat then said brother lustig and now i wish myself inside my\\nknapsack and in a second he was in it and in heaven and st peter\\nwas forced to let him stay there',\n",
       " 'once upon a time there was a man who did nothing but gamble and for\\nthat reason people never called him anything but gambling hansel and\\nas he never ceased to gamble he played away his house and all that he\\nhad now the very day before his creditors were to take his house from\\nhim came the lord and st peter and asked him to give them shelter\\nfor the night then gambling hansel said for my part you may stay\\nthe night but i cannot give you a bed or anything to eat so the lord\\nsaid he was just to take them in and they themselves would buy\\nsomething to eat to which gambling hansel made no objection thereupon\\nst peter gave him three groschen and said he was to go to the bakers\\nand fetch some bread so gambling hansel went but when he reached the\\nhouse where the other gambling vagabonds were gathered together they\\nalthough they had won all that he had greeted him clamorously and\\nsaid hansel do come in oh said he do you want to win the\\nthree groschen too on this they would not let him go so he went in\\nand played away the three groschen also meanwhile st peter and the\\nlord were waiting and as he was so long in coming they set out to\\nmeet him when gambling hansel came however he pretended that the\\nmoney had fallen into the gutter and kept raking about in it all the\\nwhile to find it but our lord already knew that he had lost it in\\nplay st peter again gave him three groschen and now he did not allow\\nhimself to be led away once more but fetched them the loaf our lord\\nthen inquired if he had no wine and he said alack sir the casks\\nare all empty but the lord said he was to go down into the cellar\\nfor the best wine was still there for a long time he would not believe\\nthis but at length he said well i will go down but i know that\\nthere is none there when he turned the tap however lo and behold\\nthe best of wine ran out so he took it to them and the two passed the\\nnight there early next day our lord told gambling hansel that he might\\nbeg three favours the lord expected that he would ask to go to heaven\\nbut gambling hansel asked for a pack of cards with which he could win\\neverything for dice with which he would win everything and for a tree\\nwhereon every kind of fruit would grow and from which no one who had\\nclimbed up could descend until he bade him do so the lord gave him\\nall that he had asked and departed with st peter\\n\\nand now gambling hansel at once set about gambling in real earnest and\\nbefore long he had gained half the world upon this st peter said to\\nthe lord lord this thing must not go on he will win and thou lose\\nthe whole world we must send death to him when death appeared\\ngambling hansel had just seated himself at the gamingtable and death\\nsaid hansel come out a while but gambling hansel said just wait\\na little until the game is done and in the meantime get up into that\\ntree out there and gather a little fruit that we may have something to\\nmunch on our way thereupon death climbed up but when he wanted to\\ncome down again he could not and gambling hansel left him up there\\nfor seven years during which time no one died\\n\\nso st peter said to the lord lord this thing must not go on people\\nno longer die we must go ourselves and they went themselves and the\\nlord commanded hansel to let death come down so hansel went at once to\\ndeath and said to him come down and death took him directly and put\\nan end to him they went away together and came to the next world and\\nthen gambling hansel made straight for the door of heaven and knocked\\nat it who is there gambling hansel ah we will have nothing to\\ndo with him begone so he went to the door of purgatory and knocked\\nonce more who is there gambling hansel ah there is quite\\nenough weeping and wailing here without him we do not want to gamble\\njust go away again then he went to the door of hell and there they\\nlet him in there was however no one at home but old lucifer and the\\ncrooked devils who had just been doing their evil work in the world\\nand no sooner was hansel there than he sat down to gamble again\\nlucifer however had nothing to lose but his misshapen devils and\\ngambling hansel won them from him as with his cards he could not fail\\nto do and now he was off again with his crooked devils and they went\\nto hohenfuert and pulled up a hoppole and with it went to heaven and\\nbegan to thrust the pole against it and heaven began to crack so\\nagain st peter said lord this thing cannot go on we must let him\\nin or he will throw us down from heaven and they let him in but\\ngambling hansel instantly began to play again and there was such a\\nnoise and confusion that there was no hearing what they themselves were\\nsaying therefore st peter once more said lord this cannot go on\\nwe must throw him down or he will make all heaven rebellious so they\\nwent to him at once and threw him down and his soul broke into\\nfragments and went into the gambling vagabonds who are living this\\nvery day',\n",
       " 'hans had served his master for seven years so he said to him master\\nmy time is up now i should be glad to go back home to my mother give\\nme my wages the master answered you have served me faithfully and\\nhonestly as the service was so shall the reward be and he gave hans\\na piece of gold as big as his head hans pulled his handkerchief out of\\nhis pocket wrapped up the lump in it put it on his shoulder and set\\nout on the way home\\n\\nas he went on always putting one foot before the other he saw a\\nhorseman trotting quickly and merrily by on a lively horse ah said\\nhans quite loud what a fine thing it is to ride there you sit as on\\na chair you stumble over no stones you save your shoes and get on\\nyou dont know how\\n\\nthe rider who had heard him stopped and called out hollo hans why\\ndo you go on foot then\\n\\ni must answered he for i have this lump to carry home it is true\\nthat it is gold but i cannot hold my head straight for it and it\\nhurts my shoulder\\n\\ni will tell you what said the rider we will exchange i will give\\nyou my horse and you can give me your lump\\n\\nwith all my heart said hans but i can tell you you will have to\\ncrawl along with it\\n\\nthe rider got down took the gold and helped hans up then gave him\\nthe bridle tight in his hands and said if you want to go at a really\\ngood pace you must click your tongue and call out jup jup\\n\\nhans was heartily delighted as he sat upon the horse and rode away so\\nbold and free after a little while he thought that it ought to go\\nfaster and he began to click with his tongue and call out jup jup\\nthe horse put himself into a sharp trot and before hans knew where he\\nwas he was thrown off and lying in a ditch which separated the field\\nfrom the highway the horse would have gone off too if it had not been\\nstopped by a countryman who was coming along the road and driving a\\ncow before him\\n\\nhans got his limbs together and stood up on his legs again but he was\\nvexed and said to the countryman it is a poor joke this riding\\nespecially when one gets hold of a mare like this that kicks and\\nthrows one off so that one has a chance of breaking ones neck never\\nagain will i mount it now i like your cow for one can walk quietly\\nbehind her and have over and above ones milk butter and cheese\\nevery day without fail what would i not give to have such a cow\\nwell said the countryman if it would give you so much pleasure i\\ndo not mind giving the cow for the horse hans agreed with the\\ngreatest delight the countryman jumped upon the horse and rode\\nquickly away\\n\\nhans drove his cow quietly before him and thought over his lucky\\nbargain if only i have a morsel of bread—and that can hardly fail\\nme—i can eat butter and cheese with it as often as i like if i am\\nthirsty i can milk my cow and drink the milk good heart what more\\ncan i want\\n\\nwhen he came to an inn he made a halt and in his great content ate up\\nwhat he had with him—his dinner and supper—and all he had and with his\\nlast few farthings had half a glass of beer then he drove his cow\\nonwards along the road to his mothers village\\n\\nas it drew nearer midday the heat was more oppressive and hans found\\nhimself upon a moor which it took about an hour to cross he felt it\\nvery hot and his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth with thirst i\\ncan find a cure for this thought hans i will milk the cow now and\\nrefresh myself with the milk he tied her to a withered tree and as\\nhe had no pail he put his leather cap underneath but try as he would\\nnot a drop of milk came and as he set himself to work in a clumsy way\\nthe impatient beast at last gave him such a blow on his head with its\\nhind foot that he fell on the ground and for a long time could not\\nthink where he was\\n\\nby good fortune a butcher just then came along the road with a\\nwheelbarrow in which lay a young pig what sort of a trick is this\\ncried he and helped the good hans up hans told him what had happened\\nthe butcher gave him his flask and said take a drink and refresh\\nyourself the cow will certainly give no milk it is an old beast at\\nthe best it is only fit for the plough or for the butcher well\\nwell said hans as he stroked his hair down on his head who would\\nhave thought it certainly it is a fine thing when one can kill a beast\\nlike that at home what meat one has but i do not care much for beef\\nit is not juicy enough for me a young pig like that now is the thing\\nto have it tastes quite different and then there are the sausages\\n\\nhark ye hans said the butcher out of love for you i will\\nexchange and will let you have the pig for the cow heaven repay you\\nfor your kindness said hans as he gave up the cow whilst the pig was\\nunbound from the barrow and the cord by which it was tied was put in\\nhis hand\\n\\nhans went on and thought to himself how everything was going just as\\nhe wished if he did meet with any vexation it was immediately set\\nright presently there joined him a lad who was carrying a fine white\\ngoose under his arm they said good morning to each other and hans\\nbegan to tell of his good luck and how he had always made such good\\nbargains the boy told him that he was taking the goose to a\\nchristeningfeast just lift her added he and laid hold of her by\\nthe wings how heavy she is—she has been fattened up for the last\\neight weeks whoever has a bit of her when she is roasted will have to\\nwipe the fat from both sides of his mouth yes said hans as he\\nweighed her in one hand she is a good weight but my pig is no bad\\none\\n\\nmeanwhile the lad looked suspiciously from one side to the other and\\nshook his head look here he said at length it may not be all\\nright with your pig in the village through which i passed the mayor\\nhimself had just had one stolen out of its sty i fear—i fear that you\\nhave got hold of it there they have sent out some people and it would\\nbe a bad business if they caught you with the pig at the very least\\nyou would be shut up in the dark hole\\n\\nthe good hans was terrified goodness he said help me out of this\\nfix you know more about this place than i do take my pig and leave me\\nyour goose i shall risk something at that game answered the lad\\nbut i will not be the cause of your getting into trouble so he took\\nthe cord in his hand and drove away the pig quickly along a bypath\\n\\nthe good hans free from care went homewards with the goose under his\\narm when i think over it properly said he to himself i have even\\ngained by the exchange first there is the good roastmeat then the\\nquantity of fat which will drip from it and which will give me\\ndripping for my bread for a quarter of a year and lastly the beautiful\\nwhite feathers i will have my pillow stuffed with them and then\\nindeed i shall go to sleep without rocking how glad my mother will\\nbe\\n\\nas he was going through the last village there stood a\\nscissorsgrinder with his barrow as his wheel whirred he sang—\\n\\ni sharpen scissors and quickly grind\\nmy coat blows out in the wind behind\\n\\n\\nhans stood still and looked at him at last he spoke to him and said\\nalls well with you as you are so merry with your grinding yes\\nanswered the scissorsgrinder the trade has a golden foundation a\\nreal grinder is a man who as often as he puts his hand into his pocket\\nfinds gold in it but where did you buy that fine goose\\n\\ni did not buy it but exchanged my pig for it\\n\\nand the pig\\n\\nthat i got for a cow\\n\\nand the cow\\n\\ni took that instead of a horse\\n\\nand the horse\\n\\nfor that i gave a lump of gold as big as my head\\n\\nand the gold\\n\\nwell that was my wages for seven years service\\n\\nyou have known how to look after yourself each time said the\\ngrinder if you can only get on so far as to hear the money jingle in\\nyour pocket whenever you stand up you will have made your fortune\\n\\nhow

great trouble and was forced to stop\\nevery minute the stones too weighed him down dreadfully then he\\ncould not help thinking how nice it would be if he had not to carry\\nthem just then\\n\\nhe crept like a snail to a well in a field and there he thought that\\nhe would rest and refresh himself with a cool draught of water but in\\norder that he might not injure the stones in sitting down he laid them\\ncarefully by his side on the edge of the well then he sat down on it\\nand was to stoop and drink when he made a slip pushed against the\\nstones and both of them fell into the water when hans saw them with\\nhis own eyes sinking to the bottom he jumped for joy and then knelt\\ndown and with tears in his eyes thanked god for having shown him this\\nfavour also and delivered him in so good a way and without his having\\nany need to reproach himself from those heavy stones which had been\\nthe only things that troubled him\\n\\nthere is no man under the sun so fortunate as i he

if you will throw me back\\nagain into the water i will change your little hut into a splendid\\ncastle then the fisherman answered of what use is a castle to me\\nif i have nothing to eat the gold fish continued that shall be\\ntaken care of there will be a cupboard in the castle in which when\\nyou open it shall be dishes of the most delicate meats and as many of\\nthem as you can desire if that be true said the man then i can\\nwell do you a favour yes said the fish there is however the\\ncondition that you shall disclose to no one in the world whosoever he\\nmay be whence your good luck has come if you speak but one single\\nword all will be over then the man threw the wonderful fish back\\nagain into the water and went home but where his hovel had formerly\\nstood now stood a great castle he opened wide his eyes entered and\\nsaw his wife dressed in beautiful clothes sitting in a splendid room\\nand she was quite delighted and said husband how has all this come\\nto pass it suits me very well yes said the man it suits me too\\nbut i am frightfully hungry just give me something to eat said the\\nwife but i have got nothing and dont know where to find anything in\\nthis new house there is no need of your knowing said the man for\\ni see yonder a great cupboard just unlock it when she opened it\\nthere stood cakes meat fruit wine quite a bright prospect\\n\\nthen the woman cried joyfully what more can you want my dear and\\nthey sat down and ate and drank together when they had had enough\\nthe woman said but husband whence come all these riches alas\\nanswered he do not question me about it for i dare not tell you\\nanything if i disclose it to any one then all our good fortune will\\nfly very good said she if i am not to know anything then i do\\nnot want to know anything however she was not in earnest she never\\nrested day or night and she goaded her husband until in his impatience\\nhe revealed that all was owing to a wonderful golden fish which he had\\ncaught and to which in return he had given its liberty and as soon as\\nthe secret was out the splendid castle with the cupboard immediately\\ndisappeared they were once more in the old fishermans hut and the\\nman was obliged to follow his former trade and fish but fortune would\\nso have it that he once more drew out the golden fish listen said\\nthe fish if you will throw me back into the water again i will once\\nmore give you the castle with the cupboard full of roast and boiled\\nmeats only be firm for your lifes sake dont reveal from whom you\\nhave it or you will lose it all again i will take good care\\nanswered the fisherman and threw the fish back into the water now at\\nhome everything was once more in its former magnificence and the wife\\nwas overjoyed at their good fortune but curiosity left her no peace\\nso that after a couple of days she began to ask again how it had come\\nto pass and how he had managed to secure it the man kept silence for\\na short time but at last she made him so angry that he broke out and\\nbetrayed the secret in an instant the castle disappeared and they\\nwere back again in their old hut now you have got what you want\\nsaid he and we can gnaw at a bare bone again ah said the woman\\ni had rather not have riches if i am not to know from whom they come\\nfor then i have no peace\\n\\nthe man went back to fish and after a while he chanced to draw out the\\ngold fish for a third time listen said the fish i see very well\\nthat i am fated to fall into your hands take me home and cut me into\\nsix pieces give your wife two of them to eat two to your horse and\\nbury two of them in the ground then they will bring you a blessing\\nthe fisherman took the fish home with him and did as it had bidden\\nhim it came to pass however that from the two pieces that were\\nburied in the ground two golden lilies sprang up that the horse had\\ntwo golden foals and the fishermans wife bore two children who were\\nmade entirely of gold the children grew up became tall and handsome\\nand the lilies and horses grew likewise then they said father we\\nwant to mount our golden steeds and travel out in the world but he\\nanswered sorrowfully how shall i bear it if you go away and i know\\nnot how it fares with you then they said the two golden lilies\\nremain here by them you can see how it is with us if they are fresh\\nthen we are in health if they are withered we are ill if they\\nperish then we are dead so they rode forth and came to an inn in\\nwhich were many people and when they perceived the goldchildren they\\nbegan to laugh and jeer when one of them heard the mocking he felt\\nashamed and would not go out into the world but turned back and went\\nhome again to his father but the other rode forward and reached a\\ngreat forest as he was about to enter it the people said it is not\\nsafe for you to ride through the wood is full of robbers who would\\ntreat you badly you will fare ill and when they see that you are all\\nof gold and your horse likewise they will assuredly kill you\\n\\nbut he would not allow himself to be frightened and said i must and\\nwill ride through it then he took bearskins and covered himself and\\nhis horse with them so that the gold was no more to be seen and rode\\nfearlessly into the forest when he had ridden onward a little he heard\\na rustling in the bushes and heard voices speaking together from one\\nside came cries of there is one but from the other let him go\\ntis an idle fellow as poor and bare as a churchmouse what should we\\ngain from him\\n\\nso the goldchild rode joyfully through the forest and no evil befell\\nhim one day he entered a village wherein he saw a maiden who was so\\nbeautiful that he did not believe that any more beautiful than she\\nexisted in the world and as such a mighty love took possession of him\\nhe went up to her and said i love thee with my whole heart wilt thou\\nbe my wife he too pleased the maiden so much that she agreed and\\nsaid yes i will be thy wife and be true to thee my whole life\\nlong then they were married and just as they were in the greatest\\nhappiness home came the father of the bride and when he saw that his\\ndaughters wedding was being celebrated he was astonished and said\\nwhere is the bridegroom they showed him the goldchild who\\nhowever still wore his bearskins then the father said wrathfully a\\nvagabond shall never have my daughter and was about to kill him then\\nthe bride begged as hard as she could and said he is my husband and\\ni love him with all my heart until at last he allowed himself to be\\nappeased nevertheless the idea never left his thoughts so that next\\nmorning he rose early wishing to see whether his daughters husband\\nwas a common ragged beggar but when he peeped in he saw a magnificent\\ngolden man in the bed and the castoff bearskins lying on the ground\\nthen he went back and thought what a good thing it was that i\\nrestrained my anger i should have committed a great crime but the\\ngoldchild dreamed that he rode out to hunt a splendid stag and when\\nhe awoke in the morning he said to his wife i must go out hunting\\nshe was uneasy and begged him to stay there and said you might\\neasily meet with a great misfortune but he answered i must and will\\ngo\\n\\nthereupon he got up and rode forth into the forest and it was not\\nlong before a fine stag crossed his path exactly according to his\\ndream he aimed and was about to shoot it when the stag ran away he\\ngave chase over hedges and ditches for the whole day without feeling\\ntired but in the evening the stag vanished from his sight and when\\nthe goldchild looked round him he was standing before a little house\\nwherein was a witch he knocked and a little old woman came out and\\nasked what are you doing so late in the midst of the great forest\\nhave you not seen a stag yes answered she i know the stag\\nwell and thereupon a little dog which had come out of the house with\\nher barked at the man violently wilt thou be silent thou odious\\ntoad said he or i will shoot thee dead then the witch cried out\\nin a passion what will you slay my little dog and immediately\\ntransformed him so that he lay like a stone and his bride awaited him\\nin vain and thought that which i so greatly dreaded which lay so\\nheavily on my heart has come upon him but at home the other brother\\nwas standing by the goldlilies when one of them suddenly drooped\\ngood heavens said he my brother has met with some great\\nmisfortune i must away to see if i can possibly rescue him then the\\nfather said stay here if i lose you also what shall i do but he\\nanswered i must and will go forth\\n\\nthen he mounted his golden horse and rode forth and entered the great\\nforest where his brother lay turned to stone the old witch came out\\nof her house and called him wishing to entrap him also but he did not\\ngo near her and said i will shoot you if you will not bring my\\nbrother to life again she touched the stone though very unwillingly\\nwith her forefinger and he was immediately restored to his human\\nshape but the two goldchildren rejoiced when they saw each other\\nagain kissed and caressed each other and rode away together out of\\nthe forest the one home to his bride and the other to his father the\\nfather then said i knew well that you had rescued your brother for\\nthe golden lily suddenly rose up and blossomed out again then they\\nlived happily and all prospered with them

not much to offer him but what\\nthey had they would give him with all their hearts then she put the\\npotatoes on the fire and while they were boiling she milked the goat\\nthat they might have a little milk with them when the cloth was laid\\nthe lord sat down with the man and his wife and he enjoyed their\\ncoarse food for there were happy faces at the table when they had had\\nsupper and it was bedtime the woman called her husband apart and\\nsaid hark you dear husband let us make up a bed of straw for\\nourselves tonight and then the poor traveler can sleep in our bed and\\nhave a good

lay\\ndown in their bed while they themselves lay on some straw on the\\nground\\n\\nnext morning they got up before daybreak and made as good a breakfast\\nas they could for the guest when the sun shone in through the little\\nwindow and the lord had got up he again ate with them and then\\nprepared to set out on his journey\\n\\nbut as he was standing at the door he turned round and said as you\\nare so kind and good you may wish three things for yourselves and i\\nwill grant them then the man said what else should i wish for but\\neternal happiness and that we two as long as we live may be healthy\\nand have every day our daily bread for the third wish i do not know\\nwhat to have and the lord said to him will you wish for a new house\\ninstead of this old one oh yes said the man if i can have that\\ntoo i should like it very much and the lord fulfilled his wish and\\nchanged their old house into a new one again gave them his blessing\\nand went on\\n\\nthe sun was high when the

how that has come to pass\\n\\nso his wife went and asked the poor man and he said to her yesterday\\nevening a traveler came here and asked for a nights lodging and this\\nmorning when he took leave of us he granted us three wishes—eternal\\nhappiness health during this life and our daily bread as well and\\nbesides this a beautiful new house instead of our old hut\\n\\nwhen the rich mans wife heard this she ran back in haste and told her\\nhusband how it had happened the man said i could tear myself to\\npieces if i had but known that that traveler came to our house too\\nand wanted to sleep here and i sent him away quick said his wife\\nget on your horse you can still catch the man up and then you must\\nask to have three wishes granted to you\\n\\nthe rich man followed the good counsel and galloped away on his horse\\nand soon came up with the lord he spoke to him softly and pleasantly\\nand begged him not to take it amiss that he had not let him in\\ndirectly he was looking for the frontdoor key and in the meantime\\nthe stranger had gone away if he returned the same way he must come\\nand stay with him yes said the lord if i ever come back again i\\nwill do so then the rich man asked if might not wish for three things\\ntoo as his neighbor had done yes said the lord he might but it\\nwould not be to his advantage and he had better not wish for anything\\nbut the rich man thought that he could easily ask for something which\\nwould add to his happiness if he only knew that it would be granted\\nso the lord said to him ride home then and three wishes which you\\nshall form shall be fulfilled\\n\\nthe rich man had now gained what he wanted so he rode home and began\\nto consider what he should wish for as he was thus thinking he let the\\nbridle fall and the horse began to caper about so that he was\\ncontinually disturbed in his meditations and could not collect his\\nthoughts at all he patted its neck and said gently lisa but the\\nhorse only began new tricks then at last he was angry and cried quite\\nimpatiently i wish your neck was broken directly he had said the\\nwords down the horse fell on the ground and there it lay dead and\\nnever moved again and thus was his first wish fulfilled as he was\\nmiserly by nature he did not like to leave the harness lying there so\\nhe cut it off and put it on his back and now he had to go on foot i\\nhave still two wishes left said he and comforted himself with that\\nthought\\n\\nand now as he was walking slowly through the sand and the sun was\\nburning hot at noonday he grew quite hottempered and angry the\\nsaddle hurt his back and he had not yet any idea what to wish for if\\ni were to wish for all the riches and treasures in the world said he\\nto himself i should still to think of all kinds of other things later\\non i know that beforehand but i will manage so that there is nothing\\nat all left me to wish for afterwards then he sighed and said ah\\nif i were but that bavarian peasant who likewise had three wishes\\ngranted to him and knew quite well what to do and in the first place\\nwished for a great deal of beer and in the second for as much beer as\\nhe was able to drink and in the third for a barrel of beer into the\\nbargain\\n\\nmany a time he thought he had found it but then it seemed to him to\\nbe after all too little then it came into his mind what an easy\\nlife his wife had for she stayed at home in a cool room and enjoyed\\nherself this really did vex him and before he was aware he said i\\njust wish she was sitting there on this saddle and could not get off\\nit instead of my having to drag it along on my back and as the last\\nword was spoken the saddle disappeared from his back and he saw that\\nhis second wish had been fulfilled then he really did feel warm he\\nbegan to run and wanted to be quite alone in his own room at home to\\nthink of something really large for his last wish but when he arrived\\nthere and opened the parlourdoor he saw his wife sitting in the\\nmiddle of the room on the saddle crying and complaining and quite\\nunable to get off it so he said do bear it and i will wish for all\\nthe riches on earth for thee only stay where thou art she however\\ncalled him a fool and said what good will all the riches on earth do\\nme if i am to sit on this saddle thou hast wished me on it so thou\\nmust help me off so whether he would or not he was forced to let his\\nthird wish be that she should be quit of the saddle and able to get\\noff it and immediately the wish was fulfilled so he got nothing by it\\nbut vexation trouble abuse and the loss of his horse but the poor\\npeople lived happily quietly and piously until their happy death',\n",

come with me i will take great care of\\nthee and guard thee from all light so they went away together and\\ntook with them their little child as well she had a chamber built\\nthere so strong and thick that no ray could pierce through it in this\\nhe was to shut himself up when the candles were lit for the\\nweddingfeast but the door was made of green wood which warped and\\nleft a little crack which no one noticed the wedding was celebrated\\nwith magnificence but when the procession with all its candles and\\ntorches came back from church and passed by this apartment a ray\\nabout

thee the way and\\nif thou followest the trace thou canst release me thereupon the dove\\nflew out at the door and she followed him and at every seventh step a\\nred drop of blood and a little white feather fell down and showed her\\nthe way\\n\\nso she went continually further and further in the wide world never\\nlooking about her or resting and the seven years were almost past\\nthen she rejoiced and thought that they would soon be delivered and\\nyet they were so far from it once when they were thus moving onwards\\nno little feather and no drop of red blood fell and when she raised\\nher eyes the dove had disappeared and as she thought to herself in\\nthis no man can help thee she climbed up to the sun and said to him\\nthou shinest into every crevice and over every peak hast thou not\\nseen a white dove flying no said the sun i have seen none but i\\npresent thee with a casket open it when thou art in sorest need then\\nshe thanked the sun and went on until evening came and the moon\\nappeared she then asked her thou shinest the whole night through\\nand on every field and forest hast thou not seen a white dove flying\\nno said the moon i have seen no dove but here i give thee an egg\\nbreak it when thou art in great need she thanked the moon and went\\non until the night wind came up and blew on her then she said to it\\nthou blowest over every tree and under every leaf hast thou not seen\\na white dove flying no said the night wind i have seen none but\\ni will ask the three other winds perhaps they have seen it the east\\nwind and the west wind came and had seen nothing but the south wind\\nsaid i have seen the white dove it has flown to the red sea where\\nit has become a lion again for the seven years are over and the lion\\nis there fighting with a dragon the dragon however is an enchanted\\nprincess the night wind then said to her i will advise thee go to\\nthe red sea on the right bank are some tall reeds count them break\\noff the eleventh and strike the dragon with it then the lion will be\\nable to subdue it and both then will regain their human form after\\nthat look round and thou wilt see the griffin which is by the

it will\\nimmediately shoot up and a tall nuttree will grow out of the water on\\nwhich the griffin may rest for if he cannot rest he will not be\\nstrong enough to carry you across and if thou

from enchantment she took the\\nyouth by the arm seated herself on the griffin and carried him off\\nwith her there stood the poor maiden who had wandered so far and was\\nagain forsaken she sat down

bed and said i have followed after\\nthee for seven years i have been to the sun and the moon and the four\\nwinds and have enquired for thee and have helped thee against the\\ndragon wilt thou then quite forget me but the prince slept so\\nsoundly that it only seemed to him as if the wind were whistling\\noutside in the firtrees when therefore day broke she was led out\\nagain and had to give up the golden dress and as that even had been\\nof no avail she was sad went out into a meadow sat down there and\\nwept while she was sitting there she thought of the egg which the\\nmoon had given her she opened it and there came out a clucking hen\\nwith twelve chickens all of gold and they ran about chirping and\\ncrept again under the old hens wings nothing more beautiful was ever\\nseen in the world then she arose and drove them through the meadow\\nbefore her until the bride looked out of the window the little\\nchickens pleased her so much that she immediately came down and asked\\nif they were for sale not for money or land but for flesh and blood\\nlet me sleep another night in the chamber where the bridegroom sleeps\\nthe bride said yes intending to cheat her as on the former evening\\nbut when the prince went to bed he asked the page what the murmuring\\nand rustling in the night had been on this the page told all that he\\nhad been forced to give him a sleepingdraught because a poor girl had\\nslept secretly in the chamber and that he was to give him another that\\nnight the prince said pour out the draught by the bedside at\\nnight she was again led in and when she began to relate how ill all\\nhad fared with her he immediately recognized his beloved wife by her\\nvoice sprang up and cried now i really am released i have been as\\nit were in a dream for the strange princess has bewitched me so that i\\nhave been compelled to forget thee but god has delivered me from the\\nspell at the right time then they both left the castle secretly in\\nthe night for they feared the father of the princess who was a\\nsorcerer and they seated themselves on the griffin which bore them\\nacross the red sea and when they were in the midst of it she let fall\\nthe nut immediately a tall nuttree grew up whereon the bird rested\\nand then carried them home where they found their child who had grown\\ntall and beautiful and they lived thenceforth happily until their\\ndeath',\n",
       " 'there was once upon a time an old queen whose husband had been dead for\\nmany years and she had a beautiful daughter when the princess grew up\\nshe was betrothed to a prince who lived at a great distance when the\\ntime came for her to be married and she had to journey forth into the\\ndistant kingdom the aged queen packed up for her many costly vessels\\nof silver and gold and trinkets also of gold and silver and cups and\\njewels in short everything which appertained to a royal dowry for\\nshe loved her child with all her heart she likewise sent her maid in\\nwaiting who was to ride with her and hand her over to the bridegroom\\nand each had a horse for the journey but the horse of the kings\\ndaughter was called falada and could speak so when the hour of\\nparting had come the aged mother went into her bedroom took a small\\nknife and cut her finger with it until it bled then she held a white\\nhandkerchief to it into which she let three drops of blood fall gave\\nit to her daughter and said dear child preserve this carefully it\\nwill be of service to you on your way\\n\\nso they took a sorrowful leave of each other the princess put the\\npiece of cloth in her bosom mounted her horse and then went away to\\nher bridegroom after she had ridden for a while she felt a burning\\nthirst and said to her waitingmaid dismount and take my cup which\\nthou hast brought with thee for me and get me some water from the\\nstream for i should like to drink if you are thirsty said the\\nwaitingmaid get off your horse yourself and lie down and drink out\\nof the water i dont choose to be your servant so in her great\\nthirst the princess alighted bent down over the water in the stream\\nand drank and was not allowed to drink out of the golden cup then she\\nsaid ah heaven and the three drops of blood answered if thy\\nmother knew her heart would break but the kings daughter was\\nhumble said nothing and mounted her horse again she rode some miles\\nfurther but the day was warm the sun scorched her and she was\\nthirsty once more and when they came to a stream of water she again\\ncried to her waitingmaid dismount and give me some water in my\\ngolden cup for she had long ago forgotten the girls ill words but\\nthe waitingmaid said still more haughtily if you wish to drink\\ndrink as you can i dont choose to be your maid then in her great\\nthirst the kings daughter alighted bent over the flowing stream wept\\nand said ah heaven and the drops of blood again replied if thy\\nmother knew this her heart would break and as she was thus drinking\\nand leaning right over the stream the handkerchief with the three\\ndrops of blood fell out of her bosom and floated away with the water\\nwithout her observing it so great was her trouble the waitingmaid\\nhowever had seen it and she rejoiced to think that she had now power\\nover the bride for since the princess had lost the drops of blood she\\nhad become weak and powerless so now when she wanted to mount her\\nhorse again the one that was called falada the waitingmaid said\\nfalada is more suitable for me and my nag will do for thee and the\\nprincess had to be content with that then the waitingmaid with many\\nhard words bade the princess exchange her royal apparel for her own\\nshabby clothes and at length she was compelled to swear by the clear\\nsky above her that she would not say one word of this to any one at\\nthe royal court and if she had not taken this oath she would have been\\nkilled on the spot but falada saw all this and observed it well\\n\\nthe waitingmaid now mounted falada and the true bride the bad horse\\nand thus they traveled onwards until at length they entered the royal\\npalace there were great rejoicings over her arrival and the prince\\nsprang forward to meet her lifted the waitingmaid from her horse and\\nthought she was his consort she was conducted upstairs but the real\\nprincess was left standing below then the old king looked out of the\\nwindow and saw her standing in the courtyard and how dainty and\\ndelicate and beautiful she was and instantly went to the royal\\napartment and asked the bride about the girl she had with her who was\\nstanding down below in the courtyard and who she was i picked her up\\non my way for a companion give the girl something to work at that she\\nmay not stand idle but the old king had no work for her and knew of\\nnone so he said i have a little boy who tends the geese she may\\nhelp him the boy was called conrad and the true bride had to help\\nhim to tend the geese soon afterwards the false bride said to the\\nyoung king dearest husband i beg you to do me a favour he\\nanswered i will do so most willingly then send for the knacker\\nand have the head of the horse on which i rode here cut off for it\\nvexed me on the way in reality she was afraid that the horse might\\ntell how she had behaved to the kings daughter then she succeeded in\\nmaking the king promise that it should be done and the faithful falada\\nwas to die this came to the ears of the real princess and she\\nsecretly promised to pay the knacker a piece of gold if he would\\nperform a small service for her there was a great darklooking gateway\\nin the town through which morning and evening she had to pass with the\\ngeese would he be so good as to nail up faladas head on it so that\\nshe might see him again more than once the knackers man promised to\\ndo that and cut off the head and nailed it fast beneath the dark\\ngateway\\n\\nearly in the morning when she and conrad drove out their flock beneath\\nthis gateway she said in passing\\n\\nalas falada hanging there\\n\\n\\nthen the head answered\\n\\nalas young queen how ill you fare\\nif this your tender mother knew\\nher heart would surely break in two\\n\\n\\nthen they went still further out of the town and drove their geese\\ninto the country and when they had come to the meadow she sat down\\nand unbound her hair which was like pure gold and conrad saw it and\\ndelighted in its brightness and wanted to pluck out a few hairs then\\nshe said\\n\\nblow blow thou gentle wind i say\\nblow conrads little hat away\\nand make him chase it here and there\\nuntil i have braided all my hair\\nand bound it up again\\n\\n\\nand there came such a violent wind that it blew conrads hat far away\\nacross country and he was forced to run after it when he came back\\nshe had finished combing her hair and was putting it up again and he\\ncould not get any of it then conrad was angry and would not speak to\\nher and thus they watched the geese until the evening and then they\\nwent home\\n\\nnext day when they were driving the geese out through the dark gateway\\nthe maiden said\\n\\nalas falada hanging there\\n\\n\\nfalada answered\\n\\nalas young queen how ill you fare\\nif this your tender mother knew\\nher heart would surely break in two\\n\\n\\nand she sat down again in the field and began to comb out her hair and\\nconrad ran and tried to clutch it so she said in haste\\n\\nblow blow thou gentle wind i say\\nblow conrads little hat away\\nand make him chase it here and there\\nuntil i have braided all my hair\\nand bound it up again\\n\\n\\nthen the wind blew and blew his little hat off his head and far away\\nand conrad was forced to run after it and when he came back her hair\\nhad been put up a long time and he could get none of it and so they\\nlooked after their geese till evening came\\n\\nbut in the evening after they had got home conrad went to the old\\nking and said i wont tend the geese with that girl any longer\\nwhy not inquired the aged king oh because she vexes me the whole\\nday long then the aged king commanded him to relate what it was that\\nshe did to him and conrad said in the morning when we pass beneath\\nthe dark gateway with the flock there is a sorry horses head on the\\nwall and she says to it\\n\\nalas falada hanging there\\n\\n\\nand the head replies\\n\\nalas young queen how ill you fare\\nif this your tender mother knew\\nher heart would surely break in two\\n\\n\\nand conrad went on to relate what happened on the goose pasture and\\nhow when there he had to chase his hat\\n\\nthe aged king commanded him to drive his flock out again next day and\\nas soon as morning came he placed himself behind the dark gateway and\\nheard how the maiden spoke to the head of falada and then he too went\\ninto the country and hid himself in the thicket in the meadow there\\nhe soon saw with his own eyes the goosegirl and the gooseboy bringing\\ntheir flock and how after a while she sat down and unplaited her hair\\nwhich shone with radiance and soon she said\\n\\nblow blow thou gentle wind i say\\nblow conrads little hat away\\nand make him chase it here and there\\nuntil i have braided all my hair\\nand bound it up again\\n\\n\\nthen came a blast of wind and carried off conrads hat so that he had\\nto run far away while the maiden quietly went on combing and plaiting\\nher hair all of which the king observed then quite unseen he went\\naway and when the goosegirl came home in the evening he called her\\naside and asked why she did all these things i may not tell you\\nthat and i dare not lament my sorrows to any human being for i have\\nsworn not to do so by the heaven which is above me if i had not done\\nthat i should have lost my life he urged her and left her no peace\\nbut he could draw nothing from her then said he if thou wilt not\\ntell me anything tell thy sorrows to the ironstove there and he\\nwent away then she crept into the ironstove and began to weep and\\nlament and emptied her whole heart and said here am i deserted by\\nthe whole world and yet i am a kings daughter and a false\\nwaitingmaid has by force brought me to such a pass that i have been\\ncompelled to put off my royal apparel and she has taken my place with\\nmy bridegroom and i have to perform menial service as a goosegirl if\\nmy mother did but know that her heart would break\\n\\nthe aged king however was standing outside by the pipe of the stove\\nand was listening to what she said and heard it then he came back\\nagain and bade her come out of the stove and royal garments were\\nplaced on her and it was marvellous how beautiful she was the aged\\nking summoned his son and revealed to him that he had got the false\\nbride who was only a waitingmaid but that the true one was standing\\nthere as the sometime goosegirl the young king rejoiced with all his\\nheart when he saw her beauty and youth and a great feast was made\\nready to which all the people and all good friends were invited at the\\nhead of the table sat the bridegroom with the kings daughter at one\\nside of him and the waitingmaid on the other but the waitingmaid\\nwas blinded and did not recognize the princess in her dazzling array\\nwhen they had eaten and drunk and were merry the aged king asked the\\nwaitingmaid as a riddle what a person deserved who had behaved in\\nsuch and such a way to her master and at the same time related the\\nwhole story and asked what sentence such an one merited then the\\nfalse bride said she deserves no better fate than to be stripped\\nentirely naked and put in a barrel which is studded inside with\\npointed nails and two white horses should be harnessed to it which\\nwill drag her along through one street after another till she is\\ndead it is thou said the aged king and thou hast pronounced\\nthine own sentence and thus shall it be done unto thee and when the\\nsentence had been carried out the young king married his true bride\\nand both of them reigned over their kingdom in peace and happiness',\n",
       " 'once on a time a countryman had a son who was as big as a thumb and\\ndid not become any bigger and during several years did not grow one\\nhairs breadth once when the father was going out to plough the\\nlittle one said father i will go out with you thou wouldst go out\\nwith me said the father stay here thou wilt be of no use out\\nthere besides thou mightest get lost then thumbling began to cry\\nand for the sake of peace his father put him in his pocket and took\\nhim with him when he was outside in the field he took him out again\\nand set him in a freshlycut furrow whilst he was there a great giant\\ncame over the hill do thou see that great bogie said the father\\nfor he wanted to frighten the little fellow to make him good he is\\ncoming to fetch thee the giant however had scarcely taken two steps\\nwith his long legs before he was in the furrow he took up little\\nthumbling carefully with two fingers examined him and without saying\\none word went away with him his father stood by but could not utter a\\nsound for terror and he thought nothing else but that his child was\\nlost and that as long as he lived he should never set eyes on him\\nagain\\n\\nthe giant however carried him home suckled him and thumbling grew\\nand became tall and strong after the manner of giants when two years\\nhad passed the old giant took him into the forest wanted to try him\\nand said pull up a stick for thyself then the boy was already so\\nstrong that he tore up a young tree out of the earth by the roots but\\nthe giant thought we must do better than that took him back again\\nand suckled him two years longer when he tried him his strength had\\nincreased so much that he could tear an old tree out of the ground\\nthat was still not enough for the giant he again suckled him for two\\nyears and when he then went with him into the forest and said now\\njust tear up a proper stick for me the boy tore up the strongest\\noaktree from the earth so that it split and that was a mere trifle\\nto him now that will do said the giant thou art perfect and\\ntook him back to the field from whence he had brought him his father\\nwas there following the plough the young giant went up to him and\\nsaid does my father see what a fine man his son has grown into\\n\\nthe farmer was alarmed and said no thou art not my son i dont\\nwant thee leave me truly i am your son allow me to do your work i\\ncan plough as well as you nay better no no thou art not my son\\nand thou canst not plough go away however as he was afraid of this\\ngreat man he left go of the plough stepped back and stood at one side\\nof the piece of land then the youth took the plough and just pressed\\nit with one hand but his grasp was so strong that the plough went deep\\ninto the earth the farmer could not bear to see that and called to\\nhim if thou art determined to plough thou must not press so hard on\\nit that makes bad work the youth however unharnessed the horses\\nand drew the plough himself saying just go home father and bid my\\nmother make ready a large dish of food and in the meantime i will go\\nover the field then the farmer went home and ordered his wife to\\nprepare the food but the youth ploughed the field which was two acres\\nlarge quite alone and then he harnessed himself to the harrow and\\nharrowed the whole of the land using two harrows at once when he had\\ndone it he went into the forest and pulled up two oaktrees laid\\nthem across his shoulders and hung on them one harrow behind and one\\nbefore and also one horse behind and one before and carried all as if\\nit had been a bundle of straw to his parents house when he entered\\nthe yard his mother did not recognize him and asked who is that\\nhorrible tall man the farmer said that is our son she said no\\nthat cannot be our son we never had such a tall one ours was a little\\nthing she called to him go away we do not want thee the youth\\nwas silent but led his horses to the stable gave them some oats and\\nhay and all that they wanted when he had done this he went into the\\nparlour sat down on the bench and said mother now i should like\\nsomething to eat will it soon be ready then she said yes and\\nbrought in two immense dishes full of food which would have been\\nenough to satisfy herself and her husband for a week the youth\\nhowever ate the whole of it himself and asked if she had nothing more\\nto set before him no she replied that is all we have but that\\nwas only a taste i must have more she did not dare to oppose him\\nand went and put a huge caldron full of food on the fire and when it\\nwas ready carried it in at length come a few crumbs said he and\\nate all there was but it was still not sufficient to appease his\\nhunger then said he father i see well that with you i shall never\\nhave food enough if you will get me an iron staff which is strong and\\nwhich i cannot break against my knees i will go out into the world\\nthe farmer was glad put his two horses in his cart and fetched from\\nthe smith a staff so large and thick that the two horses could only\\njust bring it away the youth laid it across his knees and snap he\\nbroke it in two in the middle like a beanstalk and threw it away the\\nfather then harnessed four horses and brought a bar which was so long\\nand thick that the four horses could only just drag it the son\\nsnapped this also in twain against his knees threw it away and said\\nfather this can be of no use to me you must harness more horses and\\nbring a stronger staff so the father harnessed eight horses and\\nbrought one which was so long and thick that the eight horses could\\nonly just carry it when the son took it in his hand he broke off a\\nbit from the top of it also and said father i see that you will not\\nbe able to procure me any such staff as i want i will remain no longer\\nwith you\\n\\nso he went away and gave out that he was a smiths apprentice he\\narrived at a village wherein lived a smith who was a greedy fellow\\nwho never did a kindness to any one but wanted everything for himself\\nthe youth went into the smithy and asked if he needed a journeyman\\nyes said the smith and looked at him and thought that is a\\nstrong fellow who will strike out well and earn his bread so he\\nasked how much wages dost thou want i dont want any at all he\\nreplied only every fortnight when the other journeymen are paid i\\nwill give thee two blows and thou must bear them the miser was\\nheartily satisfied and thought he would thus save much money next\\nmorning the strange journeyman was to begin to work but when the\\nmaster brought the glowing bar and the youth struck his first blow\\nthe iron flew asunder and the anvil sank so deep into the earth that\\nthere was no bringing it out again then the miser grew angry and\\nsaid oh but i cant make any use of you you strike far too\\npowerfully what will you have for the one blow\\n\\nthen said he i will only give you quite a small blow thats all\\nand he raised his foot and gave him such a kick that he flew away over\\nfour loads of hay then he sought out the thickest iron bar in the\\nsmithy for himself took it as a stick in his hand and went onwards\\n\\nwhen he had walked for some time he came to a small farm and asked\\nthe bailiff if he did not require a headservant yes said the\\nbailiff i can make use of one you look a strong fellow who can do\\nsomething how much a year do you want as wages he again replied that\\nhe wanted no wages at all but that every year he would give him three\\nblows which he must bear then the bailiff was satisfied for he too\\nwas a covetous fellow next morning all the servants were to go into\\nthe wood and the others were already up but the headservant was\\nstill in bed then one of them called to him get up it is time we\\nare going into the wood and thou must go with us ah said he quite\\nroughly and surlily you may just go then i shall be back again\\nbefore any of you then the others went to the bailiff and told him\\nthat the headman was still lying in bed and would not go into the\\nwood with them the bailiff said they were to awaken him again and\\ntell him to harness the horses the headman however said as before\\njust go there i shall be back again before any of you and then he\\nstayed in bed two hours longer at length he arose from the feathers\\nbut first he got himself two bushels of peas from the loft made\\nhimself some broth with them ate it at his leisure and when that was\\ndone went and harnessed the horses and drove into the wood not far\\nfrom the wood was a ravine through which he had to pass so he first\\ndrove the horses on and then stopped them and went behind the cart\\ntook trees and brushwood and made a great barricade so that no horse\\ncould get through when he was entering the wood the others were just\\ndriving out of it with their loaded carts to go home then said he to\\nthem drive on i will still get home before you do he did not drive\\nfar into the wood but at once tore two of the very largest trees of\\nall out of the earth threw them on his cart and turned round when he\\ncame to the barricade the others were still standing there not able\\nto get through dont you see said he that if you had stayed with\\nme you would have got home just as quickly and would have had another\\nhours sleep he now wanted to drive on but his horses could not work\\ntheir way through so he unharnessed them laid them on the top of the\\ncart took the shafts in his own hands and pulled it all through and\\nhe did this just as easily as if it had been laden with feathers when\\nhe was over he said to the others there you see i have got over\\nquicker than you and drove on and the others had to stay where they\\nwere in the yard however he took a tree in his hand showed it to\\nthe bailiff and said isnt that a fine bundle of wood then said\\nthe bailiff to his wife the servant is a good one if he does sleep\\nlong he is still home before the others so he served the bailiff for\\na year and when that was over and the other servants were getting\\ntheir wages he said it was time for him to take his too the bailiff\\nhowever was afraid of the blows which he was to receive and earnestly\\nentreated him to excuse him from having them for rather than that he\\nhimself would be headservant and the youth should be bailiff no\\nsaid he i will not be a bailiff i am headservant and will remain\\nso but i will administer that which we agreed on the bailiff was\\nwilling to give him whatsoever he demanded but it was of no use the\\nheadservant said no to everything then the bailiff did not know what\\nto do and begged for a fortnights delay for he wanted to find some\\nway of escape the headservant consented to this delay the bailiff\\nsummoned all his clerks together and they were to think the matter\\nover and give him advice the clerks pondered for a long time but at\\nlast they said that no one was sure of his life with the headservant\\nfor he could kill a man as easily as a midge and that the bailiff\\nought to make him get into the well and clean it and when he was down\\nbelow they would roll up one of the millstones which was lying there\\nand throw it on his head and then he would never return to daylight\\nthe advice pleased the bailiff and the headservant was quite willing\\nto go down the well when he was standing down below at the bottom\\nthey rolled down the largest millstone and thought they had broken his\\nskull but he cried chase away those hens from the well they are\\nscratching in the sand up there and throwing the grains into my eyes\\nso that i cant see so the bailiff cried shsh and pretended to\\nfrighten the hens away when the headservant had finished his work he\\nclimbed up and said just look what a beautiful necktie i have on\\nand behold it was the millstone which he was wearing round his neck\\nthe headservant now wanted to take his reward but the bailiff again\\nbegged for a fortnights delay the clerks met together and advised him\\nto send the headservant to the haunted mill to grind corn by night\\nfor from thence as yet no man had ever returned in the morning alive\\nthe proposal pleased the bailiff he called the headservant that very\\nevening and ordered him to take eight bushels of corn to the mill and\\ngrind it that night for it was wanted so the headservant went to the\\nloft and put two bushels in his right pocket and two in his left and\\ntook four in a wallet half on his back and half on his breast and\\nthus laden went to the haunted mill the miller told him that he could\\ngrind there very well by day but not by night for the mill was\\nhaunted and that up to the present time whosoever had gone into it at\\nnight had been found in the morning lying dead inside he said i will\\nmanage it just you go away to bed then he went into the mill and\\npoured out the corn about eleven oclock he went into the millers\\nroom and sat down on the bench when he had sat there a while a door\\nsuddenly opened and a large table came in and on the table wine and\\nroasted meats placed themselves and much good food besides but\\neverything came of itself for no one was there to carry it after this\\nthe chairs pushed themselves up but no people came until all at once\\nhe beheld fingers which handled knives and forks and laid food on the\\nplates but with this exception he saw nothing as he was hungry and\\nsaw the food he too place himself at the table ate with those who\\nwere eating and enjoyed it when he had had enough and the others also\\nhad quite emptied their dishes he distinctly heard all the candles\\nbeing suddenly snuffed out and as it was now pitch dark he felt\\nsomething like a box on the ear then he said if anything of that\\nkind comes again i shall strike out in return and when he had\\nreceived a second box on the ear he too struck out and so it\\ncontinued the whole night he took nothing without returning it but\\nrepaid everything with interest and did not lay about him in vain at\\ndaybreak however everything ceased when the miller had got up he\\nwanted to look after him and wondered if he were still alive then the\\nyouth said i have eaten my fill have received some boxes on the\\nears but i have given some in return the miller rejoiced and said\\nthat the mill was now released from the spell and wanted to give him\\nmuch money as a reward but he said money i will not have i have\\nenough of it so he took his meal on his back went home and told the\\nbailiff that he had done what he had been told to do and would now\\nhave the reward agreed on when the bailiff heard that he was\\nseriously alarmed and quite beside himself he walked backwards and\\nforwards in the room and drops of perspiration ran down from his\\nforehead then he opened the window to get some fresh air but before\\nhe was aware the headservant had given him such a kick that he flew\\nthrough the window out into the air and so far away that no one ever\\nsaw him again then said the headservant to the bailiffs wife if he\\ndoes not come back you must take the other blow she cried no no i\\ncannot bear it and opened the other window because drops of\\nperspiration were running down her forehead then he gave her such a\\nkick that she too flew out and as she was lighter she went much\\nhigher than her husband her husband cried do come to me but she\\nreplied come thou to me i cannot come to thee and they hovered\\nabout there in the air and could not get to each other and whether\\nthey are still hovering about or not i do not know but the young\\ngiant took up his iron bar and went on his way',\n",
       " 'there was once upon a time a rich king who had three daughters who\\ndaily went to walk in the palace garden and the king was a great lover\\nof all kinds of fine trees but there was one for which he had such an\\naffection that if anyone gathered an apple from it he wished him a\\nhundred fathoms underground and when harvest time came the apples on\\nthis tree were all as red as blood the three daughters went every day\\nbeneath the tree and looked to see if the wind had not blown down an\\napple but they never by any chance found one and the tree was so\\nloaded with them that it was almost breaking and the branches hung\\ndown to the ground then the kings youngest child had a great desire\\nfor an apple and said to her sisters our father loves us far too\\nmuch to wish us underground it is my belief that he would only do that\\nto people who were strangers and while she was speaking the child\\nplucked off quite a large apple and ran to her sisters saying just\\ntaste my dear little sisters for never in my life have i tasted\\nanything so delightful then the two other sisters also ate some of\\nthe apple whereupon all three sank deep down into the earth where\\nthey could hear no cock crow\\n\\nwhen midday came the king wished to call them to come to dinner but\\nthey were nowhere to be found he sought them everywhere in the palace\\nand garden but could not find them then he was much troubled and\\nmade known to the whole land that whosoever brought his daughters back\\nagain should have one of them to wife hereupon so many young men went\\nabout the country in search that there was no counting them for every\\none loved the three children because they were so kind to all and so\\nfair of face three young huntsmen also went out and when they had\\ntravelled about for eight days they arrived at a great castle in\\nwhich were beautiful apartments and in one room a table was laid on\\nwhich were delicate dishes which were still so warm that they were\\nsmoking but in the whole of the castle no human being was either to be\\nseen or heard they waited there for half a day and the food still\\nremained warm and smoking and at length they were so hungry that they\\nsat down and ate and agreed with each other that they would stay and\\nlive in that castle and that one of them who should be chosen by\\ncasting lots should remain in the house and the two others seek the\\nkings daughters they cast lots and the lot fell on the eldest so\\nnext day the two younger went out to seek and the eldest had to stay\\nhome at midday came a small small mannikin and begged for a piece of\\nbread then the huntsman took the bread which he had found there and\\ncut a round off the loaf and was about to give it to him but whilst he\\nwas giving it to the mannikin the latter let it fall and asked the\\nhuntsman to be so good as to give him that piece again the huntsman\\nwas about to do so and stooped on which the mannikin took a stick\\nseized him by the hair and gave him a good beating next day the\\nsecond stayed at home and he fared no better when the two others\\nreturned in the evening the eldest said well how have you got on\\n\\noh very badly said he and then they lamented their misfortune\\ntogether but they said nothing about it to the youngest for they did\\nnot like him at all and always called him stupid hans because he did\\nnot exactly belong to the forest on the third day the youngest stayed\\nat home and again the little mannikin came and begged for a piece of\\nbread when the youth gave it to him the elf let it fall as before\\nand asked him to be so good as to give him that piece again then said\\nhans to the little mannikin what canst thou not pick up that piece\\nthyself if thou wilt not take as much trouble as that for thy daily\\nbread thou dost not deserve to have it then the mannikin grew very\\nangry and said he was to do it but the huntsman would not and took my\\ndear mannikin and gave him a thorough beating then the mannikin\\nscreamed terribly and cried stop stop and let me go and i will\\ntell thee where the kings daughters are when hans heard that he\\nleft off beating him and the mannikin told him that he was an earth\\nmannikin and that there were more than a thousand like him and that\\nif he would go with him he would show him where the kings daughters\\nwere then he showed him a deep well but there was no water in it and\\nthe elf said that he knew well that the companions hans had with him\\ndid not intend to deal honourably with him therefore if he wished to\\ndeliver the kings children he must do it alone the two other\\nbrothers would also be very glad to recover the kings daughters but\\nthey did not want to have any trouble or danger hans was therefore to\\ntake a large basket and he must seat himself in it with his hanger and\\na bell and be let down below were three rooms and in each of them\\nwas a princess with a manyheaded dragon whose heads she was to comb\\nand trim but he must cut them off and having said all this the elf\\nvanished when it was evening the two brothers came and asked how he\\nhad got on and he said pretty well so far and that he had seen no\\none except at midday when a little mannikin had come and begged for a\\npiece of bread that he had given some to him but that the mannikin\\nhad let it fall and had asked him to pick it up again but as he did\\nnot choose to do that the elf had begun to lose his temper and that\\nhe had done what he ought not and had given the elf a beating on\\nwhich he had told him where the kings daughters were then the two\\nwere so angry at this that they grew green and yellow next morning\\nthey went to the well together and drew lots who should first seat\\nhimself in the basket and again the lot fell on the eldest and he was\\nto seat himself in it and take the bell with him then he said if i\\nring you must draw me up again immediately when he had gone down for\\na short distance he rang and they at once drew him up again then the\\nsecond seated himself in the basket but he did just the same as the\\nfirst and then it was the turn of the youngest but he let himself be\\nlowered quite to the bottom when he had got out of the basket he took\\nhis hanger and went and stood outside the first door and listened and\\nheard the dragon snoring quite loudly he opened the door slowly and\\none of the princesses was sitting there and had nine dragons heads\\nlying upon her lap and was combing them then he took his hanger and\\nhewed at them and the nine fell off the princess sprang up threw her\\narms round his neck embraced and kissed him repeatedly and took her\\nstomacher which was made of pure gold and hung it round his neck\\nthen he went to the second princess who had a dragon with five heads\\nto comb and delivered her also and to the youngest who had a dragon\\nwith four heads he went likewise and they all rejoiced and embraced\\nhim and kissed him without stopping then he rang very loud so that\\nthose above heard him and he placed the princesses one after the other\\nin the basket and had them all drawn up but when it came to his own\\nturn he remembered the words of the elf who had told him that his\\ncomrades did not mean well by him so he took a great stone which was\\nlying there and placed it in the basket and when it was about half\\nway up his false brothers above cut the rope so that the basket with\\nthe stone fell to the ground and they thought that he was dead and\\nran away with the three princesses making them promise to tell their\\nfather that it was they who had delivered them and then they went to\\nthe king and each demanded a princess in marriage\\n\\nin the meantime the youngest huntsman was wandering about the three\\nchambers in great trouble fully expecting to have to end his days\\nthere when he saw hanging on the wall a flute then said he why\\ndost thou hang there no one can be merry here he looked at the\\ndragons heads likewise and said you too cannot help me now he\\nwalked backwards and forwards for such a long time that he made the\\nsurface of the ground quite smooth but at last other thoughts came to\\nhis mind and he took the flute from the wall and played a few notes\\non it and suddenly a number of elves appeared and with every note\\nthat he sounded one more came then he played until the room was\\nentirely filled they all asked what he desired so he said he wished\\nto get above ground back to daylight on which they seized him by every\\nhair that grew on his head and thus they flew with him onto the earth\\nagain when he was above ground he at once went to the kings palace\\njust as the wedding of one princess was about to be celebrated and he\\nwent to the room where the king and his three daughters were when the\\nprincesses saw him they fainted hereupon the king was angry and\\nordered him to be put in prison at once because he thought he must\\nhave done some injury to the children when the princesses came to\\nthemselves however they entreated the king to set him free again the\\nking asked why and they said that they were not allowed to tell that\\nbut their father said that they were to tell it to the stove and he\\nwent out listened at the door and heard everything then he caused\\nthe two brothers to be hanged on the gallows and to the third he gave\\nhis youngest daughter and on that occasion i wore a pair of glass\\nshoes and i struck them against a stone and they said klink and\\nwere broken',\n",
       " 'there was a certain merchant who had two children a boy and a girl\\nthey were both young and could not walk and two richlyladen ships of\\nhis sailed forth to sea with all his property on board and just as he\\nwas expecting to win much money by them news came that they had gone\\nto the bottom and now instead of being a rich man he was a poor one\\nand had nothing left but one field outside the town in order to drive\\nhis misfortune a little out of his thoughts he went out to this field\\nand as he was walking forwards and backwards in it a little black\\nmannikin stood suddenly by his side and asked why he was so sad and\\nwhat he was taking so much to heart then said the merchant if thou\\ncouldst help me i would willingly tell thee who knows replied the\\nblack dwarf perhaps i can help thee then the merchant told him\\nthat all he possessed had gone to the bottom of the sea and that he\\nhad nothing left but this field do not trouble thyself said the\\ndwarf if thou wilt promise to give me the first thing that rubs\\nitself against thy leg when thou art at home again and to bring it\\nhere to this place in twelve years time thou shalt have as much money\\nas thou wilt the merchant thought what can that be but my dog and\\ndid not remember his little boy so he said yes gave the black man a\\nwritten and sealed promise and went home\\n\\nwhen he reached home his little boy was so delighted that he held by a\\nbench tottered up to him and seized him fast by the legs the father\\nwas shocked for he remembered his promise and now knew what he had\\npledged himself to do as however he still found no money in his\\nchest he thought the dwarf had only been jesting a month afterwards\\nhe went up to the garret intending to gather together some old tin and\\nto sell it and saw a great heap of money lying then he was happy\\nagain made purchases became a greater merchant than before and felt\\nthat this world was wellgoverned in the meantime the boy grew tall\\nand at the same time sharp and clever but the nearer the twelfth year\\napproached the more anxious grew the merchant so that his distress\\nmight be seen in his face one day his son asked what ailed him but\\nthe father would not say the boy however persisted so long that at\\nlast he told him that without being aware of what he was doing he had\\npromised him to a black dwarf and had received much money for doing\\nso he said likewise that he had set his hand and seal to this and\\nthat now when twelve years had gone by he would have to give him up\\nthen said the son oh father do not be uneasy all will go well the\\nblack man has no power over me the son had himself blessed by the\\npriest and when the time came father and son went together to the\\nfield and the son made a circle and placed himself inside it with his\\nfather then came the black dwarf and said to the old man hast thou\\nbrought with thee that which thou hast promised me he was silent but\\nthe son asked what dost thou want here then said the black dwarf\\ni have to speak with thy father and not with thee the son replied\\nthou hast betrayed and misled my father give back the writing no\\nsaid the black dwarf i will not give up my rights they spoke\\ntogether for a long time after this but at last they agreed that the\\nson as he did not belong to the enemy of mankind nor yet to his\\nfather should seat himself in a small boat which should lie on water\\nwhich was flowing away from them and that the father should push it\\noff with his own foot and then the son should remain given up to the\\nwater so he took leave of his father placed himself in a little boat\\nand the father had to push it off with his own foot the boat capsized\\nso that the keel was uppermost and the father believed his son was\\nlost and went home and mourned for him\\n\\nthe boat however did not sink but floated quietly away and the boy\\nsat safely inside it and it floated thus for a long time until at\\nlast it stopped by an unknown shore then he landed and saw a beautiful\\ncastle before him and set out to go to it but when he entered it he\\nfound that it was bewitched he went through every room but all were\\nempty until he reached the last where a snake lay coiled in a ring\\nthe snake however was an enchanted maiden who rejoiced to see him\\nand said hast thou come oh my deliverer i have already waited\\ntwelve years for thee this kingdom is bewitched and thou must set it\\nfree how can i do that he inquired tonight come twelve black\\nmen covered with chains who will ask what thou art doing here keep\\nsilent give them no answer and let them do what they will with thee\\nthey will torment thee beat thee stab thee let everything pass only\\ndo not speak at twelve oclock they must go away again on the second\\nnight twelve others will come on the third fourandtwenty who will\\ncut off thy head but at twelve oclock their power will be over and\\nthen if thou hast endured all and hast not spoken the slightest word\\ni shall be released i will come to thee and will have in a bottle\\nsome of the water of life i will rub thee with that and then thou\\nwilt come to life again and be as healthy as before then said he i\\nwill gladly set thee free and everything happened just as she had\\nsaid the black men could not force a single word from him and on the\\nthird night the snake became a beautiful princess who came with the\\nwater of life and brought him back to life again so she threw herself\\ninto his arms and kissed him and there was joy and gladness in the\\nwhole castle after this their marriage was celebrated and he was king\\nof the golden mountain\\n\\nthey lived very happily together and the queen bore a fine boy eight\\nyears had already gone by when the king bethought him of his father\\nhis heart was moved and he wished to visit him the queen however\\nwould not let him go away and said i know beforehand that it will\\ncause my unhappiness but he suffered her to have no rest until she\\nconsented at their parting she gave him a wishingring and said\\ntake this ring and put it on thy finger and then thou wilt\\nimmediately be transported whithersoever thou wouldst be only thou\\nmust promise me not to use it in wishing me away from this place and\\nwith thy father that he promised her put the ring on his finger and\\nwished himself at home just outside the town where his father lived\\ninstantly he found himself there and made for the town but when he\\ncame to the gate the sentries would not let him in because he wore\\nsuch strange and yet such rich and magnificent clothing then he went\\nto a hill where a shepherd was watching his sheep changed clothes with\\nhim put on his old shepherdscoat and then entered the town without\\nhindrance when he came to his father he made himself known to him\\nbut he did not at all believe that the shepherd was his son and said\\nhe certainly had had a son but that he was dead long ago however as\\nhe saw he was a poor needy shepherd he would give him something to\\neat then the shepherd said to his parents i am verily your son do\\nyou know of no mark on my body by which you could recognize me yes\\nsaid his mother our son had a raspberry mark under his right arm he\\nslipped back his shirt and they saw the raspberry under his right arm\\nand no longer doubted that he was their son then he told them that he\\nwas king of the golden mountain and a kings daughter was his wife\\nand that they had a fine son of seven years old then said the father\\nthat is certainly not true it is a fine kind of a king who goes about\\nin a ragged shepherdscoat on this the son fell in a passion and\\nwithout thinking of his promise turned his ring round and wished both\\nhis wife and child with him they were there in a second but the queen\\nwept and reproached him and said that he had broken his word and had\\nbrought misfortune upon her he said i have done it thoughtlessly\\nand not with evil intention and tried to calm her and she pretended\\nto believe this but she had mischief in her mind\\n\\nthen he led her out of the town into the field and showed her the\\nstream where the little boat had been pushed off and then he said i\\nam tired sit down i will sleep awhile on thy lap and he laid his\\nhead on her lap and fell asleep when he was asleep she first drew\\nthe ring from his finger then she drew away the foot which was under\\nhim leaving only the slipper behind her and she took her child in her\\narms and wished herself back in her own kingdom when he awoke there\\nhe lay quite deserted and his wife and child were gone and so was the\\nring from his finger the slipper only was still there as a token\\nhome to thy parents thou canst not return thought he they would\\nsay that thou wast a wizard thou must be off and walk on until thou\\narrivest in thine own kingdom so he went away and came at length to a\\nhill by which three giants were standing disputing with each other\\nbecause they did not know how to divide their fathers property when\\nthey saw him passing by they called to him and said little men had\\nquick wits and that he was to divide their inheritance for them the\\ninheritance however consisted of a sword which had this property\\nthat if any one took it in his hand and said all heads off but\\nmine every head would lie on the ground secondly of a cloak which\\nmade any one who put it on invisible thirdly of a pair of boots which\\ncould transport the wearer to any place he wished in a moment he said\\ngive me the three things that i may see if they are still in good\\ncondition they gave him the cloak and when he had put it on he was\\ninvisible and changed into a fly then he resumed his own form and\\nsaid the cloak is a good one now give me the sword they said no\\nwe will not give thee that if thou were to say all heads off but\\nmine all our heads would be off and thou alone wouldst be left with\\nthine nevertheless they gave it to him with the condition that he was\\nonly to try it against a tree this he did and the sword cut in two\\nthe trunk of a tree as if it had been a blade of straw then he wanted\\nto have the boots likewise but they said no we will not give them\\nif thou hadst them on thy feet and wert to wish thyself at the top of\\nthe hill we should be left down here with nothing oh no said he\\ni will not do that so they gave him the boots as well and now when\\nhe had got all these things he thought of nothing but his wife and his\\nchild and said as though to himself oh if i were but on the golden\\nmountain and at the same moment he vanished from the sight of the\\ngiants and thus their inheritance was divided when he was near his\\npalace he heard sounds of joy and fiddles and flutes and the people\\ntold him that his wife was celebrating her wedding with another then\\nhe fell into a rage and said false woman she betrayed and deserted\\nme whilst i was asleep so he put on his cloak and unseen by all went\\ninto the palace when he entered the dininghall a great table was\\nspread with delicious food and the guests were eating and drinking\\nand laughing and jesting she sat on a royal seat in the midst of them\\nin splendid apparel with a crown on her head he placed himself behind\\nher and no one saw him when she put a piece of meat on a plate for\\nherself he took it away and ate it and when she poured out a glass of\\nwine for herself he took it away and drank it she was always helping\\nherself to something and yet she never got anything for plate and\\nglass disappeared immediately then dismayed and ashamed she arose and\\nwent to her chamber and wept but he followed her there she said has\\nthe devil power over me or did my deliverer never come then he\\nstruck her in the face and said did thy deliverer never come it is\\nhe who has thee in his power thou traitor have i deserved this from\\nthee then he made himself visible went into the hall and cried\\nthe wedding is at an end the true king has returned the kings\\nprinces and councillors who were assembled there ridiculed and mocked\\nhim but he did not trouble to answer them and said will you go\\naway or not on this they tried to seize him and pressed upon him\\nbut he drew his sword and said all heads off but mine and all the\\nheads rolled on the ground and he alone was master and once more king\\nof the golden mountain',\n",
       " 'there was once upon a time a queen who had a little daughter who was\\nstill so young that she had to be carried one day the child was\\nnaughty and the mother might say what she liked but the child would\\nnot be quiet then she became impatient and as the ravens were flying\\nabout the palace she opened the window and said i wish you were a\\nraven and would fly away and then i should have some rest scarcely\\nhad she spoken the words before the child was changed into a raven\\nand flew from her arms out of the window it flew into a dark forest\\nand stayed in it a long time and the parents heard nothing of their\\nchild then one day a man was on his way through this forest and heard\\nthe raven crying and followed the voice and when he came nearer the\\nbird said i am a kings daughter by birth and am bewitched but thou\\ncanst set me free what am i to do asked he she said go further\\ninto the forest and thou wilt find a house wherein sits an aged\\nwoman who will offer thee meat and drink but you must accept nothing\\nfor if you eatest and drinkest anything thou wilt fall into a sleep\\nand then thou wilt not be able to deliver me in the garden behind the\\nhouse there is a great heap of tan and on this thou shalt stand and\\nwait for me for three days i will come every afternoon at two oclock\\nin a carriage on the first day four white horses will be harnessed to\\nit then four chestnut horses and lastly four black ones but if thou\\nart not awake but sleeping i shall not be set free the man promised\\nto do everything that she desired but the raven said alas i know\\nalready that thou wilt not deliver me thou wilt accept something from\\nthe woman then the man once more promised that he would certainly not\\ntouch anything either to eat or to drink but when he entered the house\\nthe old woman came to him and said poor man how faint you are come\\nand refresh yourself eat and drink no said the man i will not\\neat or drink she however let him have no peace and said if you\\nwill not eat take one drink out of the glass one is nothing then he\\nlet himself be persuaded and drank shortly before two oclock in the\\nafternoon he went into the garden to the tan heap to wait for the\\nraven as he was standing there his weariness all at once became so\\ngreat that he could not struggle against it and lay down for a short\\ntime but he was determined not to go to sleep hardly however had he\\nlain down than his eyes closed of their own accord and he fell asleep\\nand slept so soundly that nothing in the world could have aroused him\\nat two oclock the raven came driving up with four white horses but\\nshe was already in deep grief and said i know he is asleep and when\\nshe came into the garden he was indeed lying there asleep on the heap\\nof tan she alighted from the carriage went to him shook him and\\ncalled him but he did not awake next day about noon the old woman\\ncame again and brought him food and drink but he would not take any of\\nit but she let him have no rest and persuaded him until at length he\\nagain took one drink out of the glass towards two oclock he went into\\nthe garden to the tan heap to wait for the raven but all at once felt\\nsuch a great weariness that his limbs would no longer support him he\\ncould not help himself and was forced to lie down and fell into a\\nheavy sleep when the raven drove up with four brown horses she was\\nalready full of grief and said i know he is asleep she went to\\nhim but there he lay sleeping and there was no wakening him next day\\nthe old woman asked what was the meaning of this he was neither eating\\nnor drinking anything did he want to die he replied i am not\\nallowed to eat or drink and will not do so but she set a dish with\\nfood and a glass with wine before him and when he smelt it he could\\nnot resist and swallowed a deep draught when the time came he went\\nout into the garden to the heap of tan and waited for the kings\\ndaughter but he became still more weary than on the day before and\\nlay down and slept as soundly as if he had been a stone at two oclock\\nthe raven came with four black horses and the coachman and everything\\nelse was black she was already in the deepest grief and said i know\\nthat he is asleep and cannot deliver me when she came to him there\\nhe was lying fast asleep she shook him and called him but she could\\nnot waken him then she laid a loaf beside him and after that a piece\\nof meat and thirdly a bottle of wine and he might consume as much of\\nall of them as he liked but they would never grow less after this she\\ntook a gold ring from her finger and put it on his and her name was\\ngraven on it lastly she laid a letter beside him wherein was written\\nwhat she had given him and that none of the things would ever grow\\nless and in it was also written i see right well that here you will\\nnever be able to deliver me but if thou art still willing to deliver\\nme come to the golden castle of stromberg it lies in thy power of\\nthat i am certain and when she had given him all these things she\\nseated herself in her carriage and drove to the golden castle of\\nstromberg\\n\\nwhen the man awoke and saw that he had slept he was sad at heart and\\nsaid she has certainly driven by and i have not set her free then\\nhe perceived the things which were lying beside him and read the\\nletter wherein was written how everything had happened so he arose and\\nwent away intending to go to the golden castle of stromberg but he\\ndid not know where it was after he had walked about the world for a\\nlong time he entered into a dark forest and walked for fourteen days\\nand still could not find his way out then it was once more evening\\nand he was so tired that he lay down in a thicket and fell asleep next\\nday he went onwards and in the evening as he was again about to lie\\ndown beneath some bushes he heard such a howling and crying that he\\ncould not go to sleep and at the time when people light the candles\\nhe saw one glimmering and arose and went towards it then he came to a\\nhouse which seemed very small for in front of it a great giant was\\nstanding he thought to himself if i go in and the giant sees me it\\nwill very likely cost me my life\\n\\nat length he ventured it and went in when the giant saw him he said\\nit is well that thou comest for it is long since i have eaten i will\\nat once eat thee for my supper id rather you would leave that\\nalone said the man i do not like to be eaten but if thou hast any\\ndesire to eat i have quite enough here to satisfy thee if that be\\ntrue said the giant thou mayst be easy i was only going to devour\\nthee because i had nothing else then they went and sat down to the\\ntable and the man took out the bread wine and meat which would never\\ncome to an end this pleases me well said the giant and ate to his\\nhearts content then the man said to him canst thou tell me where\\nthe golden castle of stromberg is the giant said i will look at my\\nmap all the towns and villages and houses are to be found on it he\\nbrought out the map which he had in the room and looked for the castle\\nbut it was not to be found on it its no matter said he i have\\nsome still larger maps in my cupboard upstairs and we will look in\\nthem but there too it was in vain the man now wanted to go\\nonwards but the giant begged him to wait a few days longer until his\\nbrother who had gone out to bring some provisions came home when the\\nbrother came home they inquired about the golden castle of stromberg\\nhe replied when i have eaten and have had enough i will look in the\\nmap then he went with them up to his chamber and they searched in\\nhis map but could not find it then he brought out still older maps\\nand they never rested until they found the golden castle of stromberg\\nbut it was many thousand miles away how am i to get there asked the\\nman the giant said i have two hours time during which i will carry\\nyou into the neighbourhood but after that i must be at home to suckle\\nthe child that we have so the giant carried the man to about a\\nhundred leagues from the castle and said thou canst very well walk\\nthe rest of the way alone and he turned back but the man went\\nonwards day and night until at length he came to the golden castle of\\nstromberg it stood on a glassmountain and the bewitched maiden drove\\nin her carriage round the castle and then went inside it he rejoiced\\nwhen he saw her and wanted to climb up to her but when he began to do\\nso he always slipped down the glass again and when he saw that he\\ncould not reach her he was filled with trouble and said to himself\\ni will stay down here below and wait for her so he built himself a\\nhut and stayed in it for a whole year and every day saw the kings\\ndaughter driving about above but never could go to her then one day\\nhe saw from his hut three robbers who were beating each other and\\ncried to them god be with ye they stopped when they heard the cry\\nbut as they saw no one they once more began to beat each other and\\nthat too most dangerously so he again cried god be with ye again\\nthey stopped looked round about but as they saw no one they went on\\nbeating each other then he cried for the third time god be with ye\\nand thought i must see what these three are about and went thither\\nand asked why they were beating each other so furiously one of them\\nsaid that he found a stick and that when he struck a door with it\\nthat door would spring open the next said that he had found a mantle\\nand that whenever he put it on he was invisible but the third said he\\nhad found a horse on which a man could ride everywhere even up the\\nglassmountain and now they did not know whether they ought to have\\nthese things in common or whether they ought to divide them then the\\nman said i will give you something in exchange for these three\\nthings money indeed have i not but i have other things of more value\\nbut first i must try yours to see if you have told the truth then\\nthey put him on the horse threw the mantle round him and gave him the\\nstick in his hand and when he had all these things they were no longer\\nable to see him so he gave them some vigorous blows and cried now\\nvagabonds you have got what you deserve are you satisfied and he\\nrode up the glassmountain but when he came in front of the castle at\\nthe top it was shut then he struck the door with his stick and it\\nsprang open immediately he went in and ascended the stairs until he\\ncame to the hall where the maiden was sitting with a golden cup full of\\nwine before her she however could not see him because he had the\\nmantle on and when he came up to her he drew from his finger the ring\\nwhich she had given him and threw it into the cup so that it rang\\nthen she cried that is my ring so the man who is to set me free must\\nbe here they searched the whole castle and did not find him but he\\nhad gone out and had seated himself on the horse and thrown off the\\nmantle when they came to the door they saw him and cried aloud in\\ntheir delight then he alighted and took the kings daughter in his\\narms but she kissed him and said now hast thou set me free and\\ntomorrow we will celebrate our wedding',\n",
       " 'there was once a poor peasant who had no land but only a small house\\nand one daughter then said the daughter we ought to ask our lord the\\nking for a bit of newlycleared land when the king heard of their\\npoverty he presented them with a piece of land which she and her\\nfather dug up and intended to sow with a little corn and grain of that\\nkind when they had dug nearly the whole of the field they found in\\nthe earth a mortar made of pure gold listen said the father to the\\ngirl as our lord the king has been so gracious and presented us with\\nthe field we ought to give him this mortar in return for it the\\ndaughter however would not consent to this and said father if we\\nhave the mortar without having the pestle as well we shall have to get\\nthe pestle so you had much better say nothing about it he would\\nhowever not obey her but took the mortar and carried it to the king\\nsaid that he had found it in the cleared land and asked if he would\\naccept it as a present the king took the mortar and asked if he had\\nfound nothing besides that no answered the countryman then the\\nking said that he must now bring him the pestle the peasant said they\\nhad not found that but he might just as well have spoken to the wind\\nhe was put in prison and was to stay there until he produced the\\npestle the servants had daily to carry him bread and water which is\\nwhat people get in prison and they heard how the man cried out\\ncontinually ah if i had but listened to my daughter alas alas if\\ni had but listened to my daughter and would neither eat nor drink so\\nhe commanded the servants to bring the prisoner before him and then\\nthe king asked the peasant why he was always crying ah if i had but\\nlistened to my daughter and what it was that his daughter had said\\nshe told me that i ought not to take the mortar to you for i should\\nhave to produce the pestle as well if you have a daughter who is as\\nwise as that let her come here she was therefore obliged to appear\\nbefore the king who asked her if she really was so wise and said he\\nwould set her a riddle and if she could guess that he would marry\\nher she at once said yes she would guess it then said the king\\ncome to me not clothed not naked not riding not walking not in the\\nroad and not out of the road and if thou canst do that i will marry\\nthee so she went away put off everything she had on and then she\\nwas not clothed and took a great fishing net and seated herself in it\\nand wrapped it entirely round and round her so that she was not naked\\nand she hired an ass and tied the fishermans net to its tail so that\\nit was forced to drag her along and that was neither riding nor\\nwalking the ass had also to drag her in the ruts so that she only\\ntouched the ground with her great toe and that was neither being in\\nthe road nor out of the road and when she arrived in that fashion the\\nking said she had guessed the riddle and fulfilled all the conditions\\nthen he ordered her father to be released from the prison took her to\\nwife and gave into her care all the royal possessions\\n\\nnow when some years had passed the king was once drawing up his troops\\non parade when it happened that some peasants who had been selling\\nwood stopped with their waggons before the palace some of them had\\noxen yoked to them and some horses there was one peasant who had\\nthree horses one of which was delivered of a young foal and it ran\\naway and lay down between two oxen which were in front of the waggon\\nwhen the peasants came together they began to dispute to beat each\\nother and make a disturbance and the peasant with the oxen wanted to\\nkeep the foal and said one of the oxen had given birth to it and the\\nother said his horse had had it and that it was his the quarrel came\\nbefore the king and he give the verdict that the foal should stay\\nwhere it had been found and so the peasant with the oxen to whom it\\ndid not belong got it then the other went away and wept and lamented\\nover his foal now he had heard how gracious his lady the queen was\\nbecause she herself had sprung from poor peasant folks so he went to\\nher and begged her to see if she could not help him to get his foal\\nback again said she yes i will tell you what to do if thou wilt\\npromise me not to betray me early tomorrow morning when the king\\nparades the guard place thyself there in the middle of the road by\\nwhich he must pass take a great fishingnet and pretend to be fishing\\ngo on fishing too and empty out the net as if thou hadst got it full\\nand then she told him also what he was to say if he was questioned by\\nthe king the next day therefore the peasant stood there and fished\\non dry ground when the king passed by and saw that he sent his\\nmessenger to ask what the stupid man was about he answered i am\\nfishing the messenger asked how he could fish when there was no water\\nthere the peasant said it is as easy for me to fish on dry land as\\nit is for an ox to have a foal the messenger went back and took the\\nanswer to the king who ordered the peasant to be brought to him and\\ntold him that this was not his own idea and he wanted to know whose it\\nwas the peasant must confess this at once the peasant however would\\nnot do so and said always god forbid he should the idea was his own\\nthey laid him however on a heap of straw and beat him and tormented\\nhim so long that at last he admitted that he had got the idea from the\\nqueen\\n\\nwhen the king reached home again he said to his wife why hast thou\\nbehaved so falsely to me i will not have thee any longer for a wife\\nthy time is up go back to the place from whence thou camest to thy\\npeasants hut one favour however he granted her she might take\\nwith her the one thing that was dearest and best in her eyes and thus\\nwas she dismissed she said yes my dear husband if you command\\nthis i will do it and she embraced him and kissed him and said she\\nwould take leave of him then she ordered a powerful sleeping draught\\nto be brought to drink farewell to him the king took a long draught\\nbut she took only a little he soon fell into a deep sleep and when\\nshe perceived that she called a servant and took a fair white linen\\ncloth and wrapped the king in it and the servant was forced to carry\\nhim into a carriage that stood before the door and she drove with him\\nto her own little house she laid him in her own little bed and he\\nslept one day and one night without awakening and when he awoke he\\nlooked round and said good god where am i he called his\\nattendants but none of them were there at length his wife came to his\\nbedside and said my dear lord and king you told me i might bring\\naway with me from the palace that which was dearest and most precious\\nin my eyes i have nothing more precious and dear than yourself so i\\nhave brought you with me tears rose to the kings eyes and he said\\ndear wife thou shalt be mine and i will be thine and he took her\\nback with him to the royal palace and was married again to her and at\\nthe present time they are very likely still living',\n",
       " 'once upon a time lived a peasant and his wife and the parson of the\\nvillage had a fancy for the wife and had wished for a long while to\\nspend a whole day happily with her the peasant woman too was quite\\nwilling one day therefore he said to the woman listen my dear\\nfriend i have now thought of a way by which we can for once spend a\\nwhole day happily together ill tell you what on wednesday you must\\ntake to your bed and tell your husband you are ill and if you only\\ncomplain and act being ill properly and go on doing so until sunday\\nwhen i have to preach i will then say in my sermon that whosoever has\\nat home a sick child a sick husband a sick wife a sick father a\\nsick mother a sick brother or whosoever else it may be and makes a\\npilgrimage to the göckerli hill in italy where you can get a peck of\\nlaurelleaves for a kreuzer the sick child the sick husband the sick\\nwife the sick father or sick mother the sick sister or whosoever\\nelse it may be will be restored to health immediately\\n\\ni will manage it said the woman promptly now therefore on the\\nwednesday the peasant woman took to her bed and complained and\\nlamented as agreed on and her husband did everything for her that he\\ncould think of but nothing did her any good and when sunday came the\\nwoman said i feel as ill as if i were going to die at once but there\\nis one thing i should like to do before my end i should like to hear\\nthe parsons sermon that he is going to preach today on that the\\npeasant said ah my child do not do it—thou mightest make thyself\\nworse if thou wert to get up look i will go to the sermon and will\\nattend to it very carefully and will tell thee everything the parson\\nsays\\n\\nwell said the woman go then and pay great attention and repeat\\nto me all that thou hearest so the peasant went to the sermon and\\nthe parson began to preach and said if any one had at home a sick\\nchild a sick husband a sick wife a sick father a sick mother a sick\\nsister brother or any one else and would make a pilgrimage to the\\ngöckerli hill in italy where a peck of laurelleaves costs a kreuzer\\nthe sick child sick husband sick wife sick father sick mother sick\\nsister brother or whosoever else it might be would be restored to\\nhealth instantly and whosoever wished to undertake the journey was to\\ngo to him after the service was over and he would give him the sack\\nfor the laurelleaves and the kreuzer\\n\\nthen no one was more rejoiced than the peasant and after the service\\nwas over he went at once to the parson who gave him the bag for the\\nlaurelleaves and the kreuzer after that he went home and even at the\\nhouse door he cried hurrah dear wife it is now almost the same\\nthing as if thou wert well the parson has preached today that\\nwhosoever had at home a sick child a sick husband a sick wife a sick\\nfather a sick mother a sick sister brother or whoever it might be\\nand would make a pilgrimage to the göckerli hill in italy where a peck\\nof laurelleaves costs a kreuzer the sick child sick husband sick\\nwife sick father sick mother sick sister brother or whosoever else\\nit was would be cured immediately and now i have already got the bag\\nand the kreuzer from the parson and will at once begin my journey so\\nthat thou mayst get well the faster and thereupon he went away he\\nwas however hardly gone before the woman got up and the parson was\\nthere directly\\n\\nbut now we will leave these two for a while and follow the peasant\\nwho walked on quickly without stopping in order to get the sooner to\\nthe göckerli hill and on his way he met his gossip his gossip was an\\neggmerchant and was just coming from the market where he had sold\\nhis eggs may you be blessed said the gossip where are you off to\\nso fast\\n\\nto all eternity my friend said the peasant my wife is ill and i\\nhave been today to hear the parsons sermon and he preached that if\\nany one had in his house a sick child a sick husband a sick wife a\\nsick father a sick mother a sick sister brother or any one else and\\nmade a pilgrimage to the göckerli hill in italy where a peck of\\nlaurelleaves costs a kreuzer the sick child the sick husband the\\nsick wife the sick father the sick mother the sick sister brother\\nor whosoever else it was would be cured immediately and so i have got\\nthe bag for the laurelleaves and the kreuzer from the parson and now\\ni am beginning my pilgrimage but listen gossip said the\\neggmerchant to the peasant are you then stupid enough to believe\\nsuch a thing as that dont you know what it means the parson wants to\\nspend a whole day alone with your wife in peace so he has given you\\nthis job to do to get you out of the way\\n\\nmy word said the peasant how id like to know if thats true\\n\\ncome then said the gossip ill tell you what to do get into my\\neggbasket and i will carry you home and then you will see for\\nyourself so that was settled and the gossip put the peasant into his\\neggbasket and carried him home\\n\\nwhen they got to the house hurrah but all was going merry there the\\nwoman had already had nearly everything killed that was in the\\nfarmyard and had made pancakes and the parson was there and had\\nbrought his fiddle with him the gossip knocked at the door and woman\\nasked who was there it is i gossip said the eggmerchant give me\\nshelter this night i have not sold my eggs at the market so now i\\nhave to carry them home again and they are so heavy that i shall never\\nbe able to do it for it is dark already\\n\\nindeed my friend said the woman thou comest at a very\\ninconvenient time for me but as thou art here it cant be helped come\\nin and take a seat there on the bench by the stove then she placed\\nthe gossip and the basket which he carried on his back on the bench by\\nthe stove the parson however and the woman were as merry as\\npossible at length the parson said listen my dear friend thou\\ncanst sing beautifully sing something to me oh said the woman i\\ncannot sing now in my young days indeed i could sing well enough but\\nthats all over now\\n\\ncome said the parson once more do sing some little song\\n\\non that the woman began and sang\\n\\nive sent my husband away from me\\nto the göckerli hill in italy\\n\\n\\nthereupon the parson sang\\n\\ni wish twas a year before he came back\\nid never ask him for the laurelleaf sack\\nhallelujah\\n\\n\\nthen the gossip who was in the background began to sing but i ought to\\ntell you the peasant was called hildebrand so the gossip sang\\n\\nwhat art thou doing my hildebrand dear\\nthere on the bench by the stove so near\\nhallelujah\\n\\n\\nand then the peasant sang from his basket\\n\\nall singing i ever shall hate from

       " 'about a thousand or more years ago there were in this country nothing\\nbut small kings and one of them who lived on the keuterberg was very\\nfond of hunting once on a time when he was

to the two other girls if i do not\\nget that one i will have none then the second girl answered from the\\nother side of the hill and pointed to the one who was on the kings\\nright hand hilloa hilloa if i do not get him i will have no one\\nthese however were the two ministers the king heard all this and\\nwhen he had come back from the chase he caused the three girls to be\\nbrought to him and asked them what they had said yesterday on the\\nmountain this they would not tell him so the king asked the eldest if\\nshe really would take him for her husband then she said yes and\\nthe two ministers married the two sisters for they were all three fair\\nand beautiful of face especially the queen who had hair like flax\\nbut the two sisters had no children and once when the king was obliged\\nto go from home he invited them to come to the queen in order to cheer\\nher for she was about to bear a child she had a little boy who\\nbrought a bright red star into the world with him then the two sisters\\nsaid to each other that they would throw the beautiful boy into the\\nwater when they had thrown him in i believe it was into the weser a\\nlittle bird flew up into the air which sang\\n\\nto thy death art thou sped\\nuntil gods word be said\\nin the white lily bloom\\nbrave boy is thy tomb\\n\\n\\nwhen the two heard that they were frightened to death and ran away in\\ngreat haste when the king came home they told him that the queen had\\nbeen delivered of a dog then the king said what god does is well\\ndone but a fisherman who dwelt near the water fished the little boy\\nout again while he was still alive and as his wife had no children\\nthey reared him when a year had gone by the king again went away and\\nthe queen had another little boy whom the false sisters likewise took\\nand threw into the water then up flew a little bird again and sang\\n\\nto thy death art thou sped\\nuntil gods word be said\\nin the white lily bloom\\nbrave boy is thy tomb\\n\\n\\nand when the king came back they told him that the queen had once more\\ngiven birth to a dog and he again said what god does is well done\\nthe fisherman however fished this one also out of the water and\\nreared him\\n\\nthen the king again journeyed forth and the queen had a little girl\\nwhom also the false sisters threw into the water then again a little\\nbird flew up on high and sang\\n\\nto thy death art thou sped\\nuntil gods word be said\\nin the white lily bloom\\nbonny girl is thy tomb\\n\\n\\nand when the king came home they told him that the queen had been\\ndelivered of a cat then the king grew angry and ordered his wife to\\nbe cast into prison and therein was she shut up for many long years\\n\\nin the meantime the children had grown up then eldest once went out\\nwith some other boys to fish but the other boys would not have him\\nwith them and said go thy way foundling\\n\\nhereupon he was much troubled and asked the old fisherman if that was\\ntrue the fisherman told him that once when he was fishing he had drawn\\nhim out of the water so the boy said he would go forth and seek his\\nfather the fisherman however entreated him to stay but he would not\\nlet himself be hindered and at last the fisherman consented then the\\nboy went on his way and walked for many days and at last he came to a\\ngreat piece of water by the side of which stood an old woman fishing\\ngood day mother said the boy\\n\\nmany thanks said she\\n\\nthou wilt fish long enough before thou catchest anything\\n\\nand thou wilt seek long enough before thou findest thy

his father\\n\\nwhen a year had gone by the second boy set out to seek his brother he\\ncame to the water and all fared with him just as with his brother and\\nnow there was no one at home but the daughter and she mourned for her\\nbrothers so much that at last she also begged the fisherman to let her\\nset forth for she wished to go in search of her brothers then she\\nlikewise came to the great piece of water and she said to the old\\nwoman good day mother\\n\\nmany thanks replied the old woman\\n\\nmay god help you with your fishing said the maiden when the old\\nwoman heard that she became quite friendly and carried her over the\\nwater gave her a wand and said to her go my daughter ever onwards\\nby this road and when you come to a great black dog you must pass it\\nsilently and boldly without either laughing or looking at it then you\\nwill come to a great high castle on the threshold of which you must\\nlet the wand fall and go straight through the castle and out again on\\nthe other side there you will see an old fountain out of which a large\\ntree has grown whereon hangs a bird in a cage which you must take\\ndown take likewise a glass of water out of the fountain and with\\nthese two things go back by the same way pick up the wand again from\\nthe threshold and take it with you and when you again pass by the dog\\nstrike him in the face with it but be sure that you hit him and then\\njust come back here to me the maiden found everything exactly as the\\nold woman had said and on her way back she found her two brothers who\\nhad sought each other over half the world they went together to the\\nplace where the black dog was lying on the road she struck it in the\\nface and it turned into a handsome prince who went with them to the\\nriver there the old woman was still standing she rejoiced much to see\\nthem again and carried them all over the water and then she too went\\naway for now she was freed the others however went to the old\\nfisherman and all were glad that they had found each other again but\\nthey hung the bird on the wall\\n\\nbut the second son could not settle at home and took his crossbow and\\nwent ahunting when he was tired he took his flute and made music\\nthe king was hunting too and heard that and went thither and when he\\nmet the youth he said who has given thee leave to hunt here\\n\\noh no one\\n\\nto whom dost thou belong then\\n\\ni am the fishermans son\\n\\nbut he has no children\\n\\nif thou wilt not believe come with me\\n\\nthat the king did and questioned the fisherman who told

the fountain to drink and she became strong and healthy but the\\ntwo false sisters were burnt and the daughter married the prince',\n",
       " 'there was once a king who had an illness and no one believed that he\\nwould come out of it with his life he had three sons who were much\\ndistressed about it and went down into the palacegarden and wept\\nthere they met an old man who inquired as to the cause of their grief\\nthey told him that their father was so ill that he would most certainly\\ndie for nothing seemed to cure him then the old man said i know of\\none more remedy and that is the water of life if he drinks of it he\\nwill become well again but it is hard to find the eldest said i\\nwill manage to find it and went to the sick king and begged to be\\nallowed to go forth in search of the water of life for that alone\\ncould save him no said the king the danger of it is too great i\\nwould rather die but he begged so long that the king consented the\\nprince thought in his heart if i bring the water then i shall be\\nbest beloved of my father and shall inherit the kingdom so he set\\nout and when he had ridden forth a little distance a dwarf stood\\nthere in the road who called to him and said whither away so fast\\nsilly shrimp said the prince very haughtily it is nothing to do\\nwith you and rode on but the little dwarf had grown angry and had\\nwished an evil wish soon after this the prince entered a ravine and\\nthe further he rode the closer the mountains drew together and at last\\nthe road became so narrow that he could not advance a step further it\\nwas impossible either to turn his horse or to dismount from the saddle\\nand he was shut in there as if in prison the sick king waited long for\\nhim but he came not then the second son said father let me go\\nforth to seek the water and thought to himself if my brother is\\ndead then the kingdom will fall to me at first the king would not\\nallow him to go either but at last he yielded so the prince set out\\non the same road that his brother had taken and he too met the dwarf\\nwho stopped him to ask whither he was going in such haste little\\nshrimp said the prince that is nothing to thee and rode on\\nwithout giving him another look but the dwarf bewitched him and he\\nlike the other rode into a ravine and could neither go forwards nor\\nbackwards so fare haughty people\\n\\nas the second son also remained away the youngest begged to be allowed\\nto go forth to fetch the water and at last the king was obliged to let\\nhim go when he met the dwarf and the latter asked him whither he was\\ngoing in such haste he stopped gave him an explanation and said i\\nam seeking the water of life for my father is sick unto death dost\\nthou know then where that is to be found no said the prince as\\nthou hast borne thyself as is seemly and not haughtily like thy false\\nbrothers i will give thee the information and tell thee how thou mayst\\nobtain the water of life it springs from a fountain in the courtyard\\nof an enchanted castle but thou wilt not be able to make thy way to\\nit if i do not give thee an iron wand and two small loaves of bread\\nstrike thrice with the wand on the iron door of the castle and it will\\nspring open inside lie two lions with gaping jaws but if thou\\nthrowest a loaf to each of them they will be quieted then hasten to\\nfetch some of the water of life before the clock strikes twelve else\\nthe door will shut again and thou wilt be imprisoned the prince\\nthanked him took the wand and the bread and set out on his way when\\nhe arrived everything was as the dwarf had said the door sprang open\\nat the third stroke of the wand and when he had appeased the lions\\nwith the bread he entered the castle and came to a large and splendid\\nhall wherein sat some enchanted princes whose rings he drew off their\\nfingers a sword and a loaf of bread were lying there which he carried\\naway after this he entered a chamber in which was a beautiful maiden\\nwho rejoiced when she saw him kissed him and told him that he had\\ndelivered her and should have the whole of her kingdom and that if he\\nwould return in a year their wedding should be celebrated likewise she\\ntold him where the spring of the water of life was and that he was to\\nhasten and draw some of it before the clock struck twelve then he went\\nonwards and at last entered a room where there was a beautiful\\nnewlymade bed and as he was very weary he felt inclined to rest a\\nlittle so he lay down and fell asleep when he awoke it was striking\\na quarter to twelve he sprang up in a fright ran to the spring drew\\nsome water in a cup which stood near and hastened away but just as he\\nwas passing through the iron door the clock struck twelve and the\\ndoor fell to with such violence that it carried away a piece of his\\nheel he however rejoicing at having obtained the water of life went\\nhomewards and again passed the dwarf when the latter saw the sword\\nand the loaf he said with these thou hast won great wealth with the\\nsword thou canst slay whole armies and the bread will never come to an\\nend but the prince would not go home to his father without his\\nbrothers and said dear dwarf canst thou not tell me where my two\\nbrothers are they went out before i did in search of the water of\\nlife and have not returned they are imprisoned between two\\nmountains said the dwarf i have condemned them to stay there\\nbecause they were so haughty then the prince begged until the dwarf\\nreleased them but he warned him however and said beware of them\\nfor they have bad hearts when his brothers came he rejoiced and\\ntold them how things had gone with him that he had found the water of\\nlife and had brought a cupful away with him and had rescued a\\nbeautiful princess who was willing to wait a year for him and then\\ntheir wedding was to be celebrated and he would obtain a great kingdom\\nafter that they rode on together and chanced upon a land where war and\\nfamine reigned and the king already thought he must perish for the\\nscarcity was so great then the prince went to him and gave him the\\nloaf wherewith he fed and satisfied the whole of his kingdom and then\\nthe prince gave him the sword also wherewith he slew the hosts of his\\nenemies and could now live in rest and peace the prince then took\\nback his loaf and his sword and the three brothers rode on but after\\nthis they entered two more countries where war and famine reigned and\\neach time the prince gave his loaf and his sword to the kings and had\\nnow delivered three kingdoms and after that they went on board a ship\\nand sailed over the sea during the passage the two eldest conversed\\napart and said the youngest has found the water of life and not we\\nfor that our father will give him the kingdom the kingdom which belongs\\nto us and he will rob us of all our fortune they then began to seek\\nrevenge and plotted with each other to destroy him they waited until\\nthey found him fast asleep then they poured the water of life out of\\nthe cup and took it for themselves but into the cup they poured salt\\nseawater now therefore when they arrived home the youngest took his\\ncup to the sick king in order that he might drink out of it and be\\ncured but scarcely had he drunk a very little of the salt seawater\\nthan he became still worse than before and as he was lamenting over\\nthis the two eldest brothers came and accused the youngest of having\\nintended to poison him and said that they had brought him the true\\nwater of life and handed it to him he had scarcely tasted it when he\\nfelt his sickness departing and became strong and healthy as in the\\ndays of his youth after that they both went to the youngest mocked\\nhim and said you certainly found the water of life but you have had\\nthe pain and we the gain you should have been sharper and should\\nhave kept your eyes open we took it from you whilst you were asleep at\\nsea and when a year is over one of us will go and fetch the beautiful\\nprincess but beware that you do not disclose aught of this to our\\nfather indeed he does not trust you and if you say a single word you\\nshall lose your life into the bargain but if you keep silent you\\nshall have it as a gift\\n\\nthe old king was angry with his youngest son and thought he had\\nplotted against his life so he summoned the court together and had\\nsentence pronounced upon his son that he should be secretly shot and\\nonce when the prince was riding forth to the chase suspecting no evil\\nthe kings huntsman had to go with him and when they were quite alone\\nin the forest the huntsman looked so sorrowful that the prince said to\\nhim dear huntsman what ails you the huntsman said i cannot tell\\nyou and yet i ought then the prince said say openly what it is i\\nwill pardon you alas said the huntsman i am to shoot you dead\\nthe king has ordered me to do it then the prince was shocked and\\nsaid dear huntsman let me live there i give you my royal garments\\ngive me your common ones in their stead the huntsman said i will\\nwillingly do that indeed i should not have been able to shoot you\\nthen they exchanged clothes and the huntsman returned home the\\nprince however went further into the forest after a time three\\nwaggons of gold and precious stones came to the king for his youngest\\nson which were sent by the three kings who had slain their enemies\\nwith the princes sword and maintained their people with his bread\\nand who wished to show their gratitude for it the old king then\\nthought can my son have been innocent and said to his people\\nwould that he were still alive how it grieves me that i have suffered\\nhim to be killed he still lives said the huntsman i could not\\nfind it in my heart to carry out your command and told the king how\\nit had happened then a stone fell from the kings heart and he had it\\nproclaimed in every country that his son might return and be taken into\\nfavour again\\n\\nthe princess however had a road made up to her palace which was quite\\nbright and golden and told her people that whosoever came riding\\nstraight along it to her would be the right wooer and was to be\\nadmitted and whoever rode by the side of it was not the right one\\nand was not to be admitted as the time was now close at hand the\\neldest thought he would hasten to go to the kings daughter and give\\nhimself out as her deliverer and thus win her for his bride and the\\nkingdom to boot therefore he rode forth and when he arrived in front\\nof the palace and saw the splendid golden road he thought it would\\nbe a sin and a shame if he were to ride over that and turned aside\\nand rode on the right side of it but when he came to the door the\\nservants told him that he was not the right man and was to go away\\nagain soon after this the second prince set out and when he came to\\nthe golden road and his horse had put one foot on it he thought it\\nwould be a sin and a shame to tread a piece of it off and he turned\\naside and rode on the left side of it and when he reached the door\\nthe attendants told him he was not the right one and he was to go away\\nagain when at last the year had entirely expired the third son\\nlikewise wished to ride out of the forest to his beloved and with her\\nforget his sorrows so he set out and thought of her so incessantly\\nand wished to be with her so much that he never noticed the golden\\nroad at all so his horse rode onwards up the middle of it and when he\\ncame to the door it was opened and the princess received him with joy\\nand said he was her deliverer and lord of the kingdom and their\\nwedding was celebrated with great rejoicing when it was over she told\\nhim that his father invited him to come to him and had forgiven him\\nso he rode thither and told him everything how his brothers had\\nbetrayed him and how he had nevertheless kept silence the old king\\nwished to punish them but they had put to sea and never came back as\\nlong as they lived',\n",

then the boy went to a high school and\\nlearned diligently so that his masters praised him and he remained\\nthere a long time when he had worked through two classes but was\\nstill not yet perfect in everything the little pittance which the\\nfather had earned was all spent and the boy was obliged to return home\\nto him ah said the father sorrowfully i can give you no more\\nand in these hard times i cannot earn a farthing more than will suffice\\nfor our daily bread dear father answered the son dont trouble\\nyourself about it if it is gods will it will turn to my advantage i\\nshall soon accustom myself to it when the father wanted to go into\\nthe forest to earn money by helping to pile and stack wood and also\\nchop it the son said i will go with you and help you nay my\\nson said the father that would be hard for you you are not\\naccustomed to rough work and will not be able to bear it besides i\\nhave only one axe and no money left wherewith to buy another just go\\nto the neighbour answered the son he will lend you his axe until i\\nhave earned one for myself the father then borrowed an axe of the\\nneighbour and next morning at break of day they went out into the\\nforest together the son helped his father and was quite merry and\\nbrisk about it but when the sun was right over their heads the father\\nsaid we will rest and have our dinner and then we shall work as\\nwell again the son took his bread in his hands and said just you\\nrest father i am not tired i will walk up and down a little in the\\nforest and look for birds nests oh you fool said the father\\nwhy should you want to run about there afterwards you will be tired\\nand no longer able to raise your arm stay here and sit down beside\\nme the son however went into the forest ate his bread was very\\nmerry and peered in among the green branches to see if he could\\ndiscover a birds nest anywhere so he went up and down to see if he\\ncould find a birds nest until at last he came to a great\\ndangerouslooking oak which certainly was already many hundred years\\nold and which five men could not have spanned he stood still and\\nlooked at it and thought many a bird must have built its nest in\\nthat then all at once it seemed to him that he heard a voice he\\nlistened and became aware that someone was crying in a very smothered\\nvoice let me out let me out he looked around but could discover\\nnothing nevertheless he fancied that the voice came out of the\\nground then he cried where art thou the voice answered i am down\\nhere amongst the roots of the oaktree let me out let me out the\\nscholar began to loosen the earth under the tree and search among the\\nroots until at last he found a glass bottle in a little hollow he\\nlifted it up and held it against the light and then saw a creature\\nshaped like a frog springing up and down in it let me out let me\\nout it cried anew and the scholar thinking no evil drew the cork\\nout of the bottle immediately a spirit ascended from it and began to\\ngrow and grew so fast that in a very few moments he stood before the\\nscholar a terrible fellow as big as half the tree by which he was\\nstanding knowest thou he cried in an awful voice what thy wages\\nare for having let me out no replied the scholar fearlessly how\\nshould i know that then i will tell thee cried the spirit i must\\nstrangle thee for it thou shouldst have told me that sooner said\\nthe scholar for i should then have left thee shut up but my head\\nshall stand fast for all thou canst do more persons than one must be\\nconsulted about that more persons here more persons there said\\nthe spirit thou shalt have the wages thou hast earned dost thou\\nthink that i was shut up there for such a long time as a favour no it\\nwas a punishment for me i am the mighty mercurius whoso releases me\\nhim must i strangle softly answered the scholar not so fast i\\nmust first know that thou really wert shut up in that little bottle\\nand that thou art the right spirit if indeed thou canst get in\\nagain i will believe and then thou mayst do as thou wilt with me the\\nspirit said haughtily that is a very trifling feat drew himself\\ntogether and made himself as small and slender as he had been at\\nfirst so that he crept through the same opening and right through the\\nneck of the bottle in again scarcely was he within than the scholar\\nthrust the cork he had drawn back into the bottle and threw it among\\nthe roots of the oak into its old place and the spirit was betrayed\\n\\nand now the scolar was about to return to his father but the spirit\\ncried very piteously ah do let me out ah do let me out no\\nanswered the scholar not a second time he who has once tried to take\\nmy life shall not be set free by me now that i have caught him again\\nif thou wilt set me free said the spirit i will give thee so much\\nthat thou wilt have plenty all the days of thy life no answered\\nthe boy thou wouldst cheat me as thou didst the first time thou\\nart playing away with thy own good luck said the spirit i will do\\nthee no harm but will reward thee richly the scholar thought i will\\nventure it perhaps he will keep his word and anyhow he shall not get\\nthe better of me then he took out the cork and the spirit rose up\\nfrom the bottle as he had done before stretched himself out and became\\nas big as a giant now thou shalt have thy reward said he and\\nhanded the scholar a little bag just like a plaster and said if thou\\nspreadest one end of this over a wound it will heal and if thou\\nrubbest steel or iron with the other end it will be changed into\\nsilver i must just try that said the scholar and went to a tree\\ntore off the bark with his axe and rubbed it with one end of the\\nplaster it immediately closed together and was healed now it is all\\nright he said to the spirit and we can part the spirit thanked\\nhim for his release and the boy thanked the spirit for his present\\nand went back to his father\\n\\nwhere hast thou been racing about said the father why hast thou\\nforgotten thy work i said at once that thou wouldst never get on with\\nanything be easy father i will make it up make it up indeed\\nsaid the father angrily theres no art in that take care father\\ni will soon hew that tree there so that it will split then he took\\nhis plaster rubbed the axe with it and dealt a mighty blow but as\\nthe iron had changed into silver the edge turned hollo father just\\nlook what a bad axe youve given me it has become quite crooked the\\nfather was shocked and said ah what hast thou done now i shall have\\nto pay for that and have not the wherewithal and that is all the good\\ni have got by thy work dont get angry said the son i will soon\\npay for the axe oh thou blockhead cried the father wherewith\\nwilt thou pay for it thou hast nothing but what i give thee these are\\nstudents tricks that are sticking in thy head but thou hast no idea\\nof woodcutting after a while the scholar said father i can really\\nwork no more we had better take a holiday eh what answered he\\ndost thou think i will sit with my hands lying in my lap like thee i\\nmust go on working but thou mayst take thyself off home father i\\nam here in this wood for the first time i dont know my way alone do\\ngo with me as his anger had now abated the father at last let\\nhimself be persuaded and went home with him then he said to the son\\ngo and sell thy damaged axe and see what thou canst get for it and i\\nmust earn the difference in order to pay the neighbour the son took\\nthe axe and carried it into town to a goldsmith who tested it laid\\nit in the scales and said it is worth four hundred thalers i have\\nnot so much as that by me the son said give me what thou hast i\\nwill lend you the rest the goldsmith gave him three hundred thalers\\nand remained a hundred in his debt the son thereupon went home and\\nsaid father i have got the money go and ask the neighbour what he\\nwants for the axe i know that already answered the old man one\\nthaler six groschen then give him two thalers twelve groschen\\nthat is double and enough see i have money in plenty and he gave\\nthe father a hundred thalers and said you shall never know want\\nlive as comfortably as you like good heavens said the father how\\nhast thou come by these riches the scholar then told how all had come\\nto pass and how he trusting in his luck had made such a good hit\\nbut with the money that was left he went back to the high school and\\nwent on learning more and as he could heal all wounds with his\\nplaster he became the most famous doctor in the whole world',\n",
       " 'a disbanded soldier had nothing to live on and did not know how to get\\non so he went out into the forest and when he had walked for a short\\ntime he met a little man who was however the devil the little man\\nsaid to him what ails you you seem so very sorrowful then the\\nsoldier said i am hungry but have no money the devil said if you\\nwill hire yourself to me and be my servingman you shall have enough\\nfor all your life you shall serve me for seven years and after that\\nyou shall again be free but one thing i must tell you and that is\\nyou must not wash comb or trim yourself or cut your hair or nails\\nor wipe the water from your eyes the soldier said all right if\\nthere is no help for it and went off with the little man who\\nstraightway led him down into hell then he told him what he had to do\\nhe was to poke the fire under the kettles wherein the hellbroth was\\nstewing keep the house clean drive all the sweepings behind the\\ndoors and see that everything was in order but if he once peeped into\\nthe kettles it would go ill with him the soldier said good i will\\ntake care and then the old devil went out again on his wanderings\\nand the soldier entered upon his new duties made the fire and swept\\nthe dirt well behind the doors just as he had been bidden when the\\nold devil came back again he looked to see if all had been done\\nappeared satisfied and went forth a second time the soldier now took\\na good look on every side the kettles were standing all round hell\\nwith a mighty fire below them and inside they were boiling and\\nsputtering he would have given anything to look inside them if the\\ndevil had not so particularly forbidden him at last he could no\\nlonger restrain himself slightly raised the lid of the first kettle\\nand peeped in and there he saw his former corporal shut in aha old\\nbird said he do i meet you here you once had me in your power now\\ni have you and he quickly let the lid fall poked the fire and added\\na fresh log after that he went to the second kettle raised its lid\\nalso a little and peeped in his former ensign was in that aha old\\nbird so i find you here you once had me in your power now i have\\nyou he closed the lid again and fetched yet another log to make it\\nreally hot then he wanted to see who might be sitting up in the third\\nkettle it was actually be but a general aha old bird do i meet you\\nhere once you had me in your power now i have you and he fetched\\nthe bellows and made hellfire blaze right under him so he did his\\nwork seven years in hell did not wash comb or trim himself or cut\\nhis hair or nails or wash the water out of his eyes and the seven\\nyears seemed so short to him that he thought he had only been half a\\nyear now when the time had fully gone by the devil came and said\\nwell hans what have you done i poked the fire under the kettles\\nand i have swept all the dirt well behind the doors\\n\\nbut you have peeped into the kettles as well it is lucky for you that\\nyou added fresh logs to them or else your life would have been\\nforfeited now that your time is up will you go home again yes\\nsaid the soldier i should very much like to see what my father is\\ndoing at home the devil said in order that you may receive the\\nwages you have earned go and fill your knapsack full of the sweepings\\nand take it home with you you must also go unwashed and uncombed with\\nlong hair on your head and beard and with uncut nails and dim eyes\\nand when you are asked whence you come you must say from hell and\\nwhen you are asked who you are you are to say the devils sooty\\nbrother and my king as well the soldier held his peace and did as\\nthe devil bade him but he was not at all satisfied with his wages\\nthen as soon as he was up in the forest again he took his knapsack\\nfrom his back to empty it but on opening it the sweepings had become\\npure gold i should never have expected that said he and was well\\npleased and entered the town the landlord was standing in front of\\nthe inn and when he saw the soldier approaching he was terrified\\nbecause hans looked so horrible worse than a scarecrow he called to\\nhim and asked whence comest thou from hell who art thou the\\ndevils sooty brother and my king as well then the host would not\\nlet him enter but when hans showed him the gold he came and unlatched\\nthe door himself hans then ordered the best room and attendance ate\\nand drank his fill but neither washed nor combed himself as the devil\\nhad bidden him and at last lay down to sleep but the knapsack full of\\ngold remained before the eyes of the landlord and left him no peace\\nand during the night he crept in and stole it away next morning\\nhowever when hans got up and wanted to pay the landlord and travel\\nfurther behold his knapsack was gone but he soon composed himself and\\nthought thou hast been unfortunate from no fault of thine own and\\nstraightway went back again to hell complained of his misfortune to\\nthe old devil and begged for his help the devil said seat yourself\\ni will wash comb and trim you cut your hair and nails and wash your\\neyes for you and when he had done with him he gave him the knapsack\\nback again full of sweepings and said go and tell the landlord that\\nhe must return you your money or else i will come and fetch him and\\nhe shall poke the fire in your place hans went up and said to the\\nlandlord thou hast stolen my money if thou dost not return it thou\\nshalt go down to hell in my place and wilt look as horrible as i\\nthen the landlord gave him the money and more besides only begging\\nhim to keep it secret and hans was now a rich man\\n\\nhe set out on his way home to his father bought himself a shabby\\nsmockfrock to wear and strolled about making music for he had\\nlearned to do that while he was with the devil in hell there was\\nhowever an old king in that country before whom he had to play and\\nthe king was so delighted with his playing that he promised him his\\neldest daughter in marriage but when she heard that she was to be\\nmarried to a common fellow in a smockfrock she said rather than do\\nthat i would go into the deepest water then the king gave him the\\nyoungest who was quite willing to do it to please her father and thus\\nthe devils sooty brother got the kings daughter and when the aged\\nking died the whole kingdom likewise',\n",
       " 'there was once a young fellow who enlisted as a soldier conducted\\nhimself bravely and was always the foremost when it rained bullets so\\nlong as the war lasted all went well but when peace was made he\\nreceived his dismissal and the captain said he might go where he\\nliked his parents were dead and he had no longer a home so he went\\nto his brothers and begged them to take him in and keep him until war\\nbroke out again the brothers however were hardhearted and said\\nwhat can we do with thee thou art of no use to us go and make a\\nliving for thyself the soldier had nothing left but his gun he took\\nthat on his shoulder and went forth into the world he came to a wide\\nheath on which nothing was to be seen but a circle of trees under\\nthese he sat sorrowfully down and began to think over his fate i\\nhave no money thought he i have learnt no trade but that of\\nfighting and now that they have made peace they dont want me any\\nlonger so i see beforehand

turned round and saw a large bear which came\\ngrowling towards him oho cried the soldier i will tickle thy nose\\nfor thee so that thou shalt soon lose thy fancy for growling and he\\naimed at the bear and shot it through the muzzle it fell down and\\nnever stirred again i see quite well said the stranger that thou\\nart not wanting in courage but there is still another condition which\\nthou wilt have to fulfil if it does not endanger my salvation\\nreplied the soldier who knew very well who was standing by him if it\\ndoes ill have nothing to do with it thou wilt look to that for\\nthyself answered greencoat thou shalt for the next seven years\\nneither wash thyself nor comb thy beard nor thy hair nor cut thy\\nnails nor say one paternoster i will give thee a coat and a cloak\\nwhich during this time thou must wear if thou diest during these seven\\nyears thou art mine if thou remainest alive thou art free and rich\\nto boot for all the rest of thy life the soldier thought of the\\ngreat extremity in which he now found himself and as he so often had\\ngone to meet death he resolved to risk it now also and agreed to the\\nterms the devil took off his green coat gave it to the soldier and\\nsaid if thou hast this coat on thy back and puttest thy hand into the\\npocket thou wilt always find it full of money then he pulled the\\nskin off the bear and said this shall be thy cloak and thy bed also\\nfor thereon shalt thou sleep and in no other bed shalt thou lie and\\nbecause of this apparel shalt thou be called bearskin after this the\\ndevil vanished\\n\\nthe soldier put the coat on felt at once in the pocket and found that\\nthe thing was really true then he put on the bearskin and went forth\\ninto the world and enjoyed himself refraining from nothing that did\\nhim good and his money harm during the first year his appearance was\\npassable but during the second he began to look like a monster his\\nhair covered nearly the whole of his face his beard was like a piece\\nof coarse felt his fingers had claws and his face was so covered with\\ndirt that if cress had been sown on it it would have come up\\nwhosoever saw him ran away but as he everywhere gave the poor money\\nto pray that he might not die during the seven years and as he paid\\nwell for everything he still always found shelter in the fourth year\\nhe entered an inn where the landlord would not receive him and would\\nnot even let him have a place in the stable because he was afraid the\\nhorses would be scared but as bearskin thrust his hand into his pocket\\nand pulled out a handful of ducats the host let himself be persuaded\\nand gave him a room in an outhouse bearskin was however obliged to\\npromise not to let himself be seen lest the inn should get a bad name\\n\\nas bearskin was sitting alone in the evening and wishing from the\\nbottom of his heart that the seven years were over he heard a loud\\nlamenting in a neighboring room he had a compassionate heart so he\\nopened the door and saw an old man weeping bitterly and wringing his\\nhands bearskin went nearer but the man sprang to his feet and tried\\nto escape from him at last when the man perceived that bearskins\\nvoice was human he let himself be prevailed on and by kind words\\nbearskin succeeded so far that the old man revealed the cause of his\\ngrief his property had dwindled away by degrees he and his daughters\\nwould have to starve and he was so poor that he could not pay the\\ninnkeeper and was to be put in prison if that is your only trouble\\nsaid bearskin i have plenty of money he caused the innkeeper to be\\nbrought thither paid him and put a purse full of gold into the poor\\nold mans pocket besides\\n\\nwhen the old man saw himself set free from all his troubles he did not\\nknow how to be grateful enough come with me said he to bearskin\\nmy daughters are all miracles of beauty choose one of them for\\nthyself as a wife when she hears what thou hast done for me she will\\nnot refuse thee thou dost in truth look a little strange but she will\\nsoon put thee to rights again this pleased bearskin well and he\\nwent when the eldest saw him she was so terribly alarmed at his face\\nthat she screamed and ran away the second stood still and looked at\\nhim from head to foot but then she said how can i accept a husband\\nwho no longer has a human form the shaven bear that once was here and\\npassed itself off for a man pleased me far better for at any rate it\\nwore a hussars dress and white gloves if it were nothing but\\nugliness i might get used to that the youngest however said dear\\nfather that must be a good man to have helped you out of your trouble\\nso if you have promised him a bride for doing it your promise must be\\nkept it was a pity that bearskins face was covered with dirt and\\nwith hair for if not they might have seen how delighted he was when he\\nheard these words he took a ring from his finger broke it in two and\\ngave her one half the other he kept for himself he wrote his name\\nhowever on her half and hers on his and begged her to keep her piece\\ncarefully and then he took his leave and said i must still wander\\nabout for three years and if i do not return then thou art free for\\ni shall be dead but pray to god to preserve my life\\n\\nthe poor betrothed bride dressed herself entirely in black and when\\nshe thought of her future bridegroom tears came into her eyes nothing\\nbut contempt and mockery fell to her lot from her sisters take care\\nsaid the

likes began the elder again or else he will growl and the\\nsecond continued but the wedding will be a merry one for bears dance\\nwell the bride was silent and did not let them vex her bearskin\\nhowever travelled about the world from one place to another did good\\nwhere he was able and gave generously to the poor that they might pray\\nfor him\\n\\nat length as the last day of the seven years dawned he went once more\\nout on to the heath and seated himself beneath the circle of trees it\\nwas not long before the wind whistled and the devil stood before him\\nand looked angrily at him then he threw bearskin his old coat and\\nasked for his own green one back we have not got so far as that yet\\nanswered bearskin thou must first make me clean whether the devil\\nliked it or not he was forced to fetch water and wash bearskin comb\\nhis hair and cut his nails after this he looked like a brave\\nsoldier and was much handsomer than he had ever been before\\n\\nwhen the devil had gone away bearskin was quite lighthearted he went\\ninto the town put on a magnificent velvet coat seated himself in a\\ncarriage drawn by four white horses and drove to his brides house no\\none recognized him the father took him for a distinguished general\\nand led him into the room where his daughters were sitting he was\\nforced to place himself between the two eldest they helped him to\\nwine gave him the best pieces of meat and thought that in all the\\nworld they had never seen a handsomer man the bride however sat\\nopposite to him in her black dress and never raised her eyes nor\\nspoke a word when at length he asked the father if he would give him\\none of his daughters to wife the two eldest jumped up ran into their\\nbedrooms to put on splendid dresses for each of them fancied she was\\nthe chosen one the stranger as soon as he was alone with his bride\\nbrought out his half of the ring and threw it in a glass of wine which\\nhe reached across the table to her she took the wine but when she had\\ndrunk it and found the half ring lying at the bottom her heart began\\nto beat she got the other half which she wore on a ribbon round her\\nneck joined them and saw that the two pieces fitted exactly together\\nthen said he i am thy betrothed bridegroom whom thou sawest as\\nbearskin but through gods grace i have again received my human form\\nand have once more become clean he went up to her embraced her and\\ngave her a kiss in the meantime the two sisters came back in full\\ndress and when they saw that the handsome man had fallen to the share\\nof the youngest and heard that he was bearskin they ran out full of\\nanger and rage one of them drowned herself in the well the other\\nhanged herself on a tree in the evening some one knocked at the

the least the man was enraged and lifted up\\nhis stick and was just going to give her the beating he had promised\\nher suddenly he let the stick fail and said you are the stupidest\\ngoose that ever waddled on gods earth but i am sorry for you i will\\ngo out into the highways and wait for three days to see if i find\\nanyone who is still stupider than you if i succeed in doing so you\\nshall go scotfree but if i do not find him you shall receive your\\nwelldeserved reward without any discount\\n\\nhe went out into the great highways sat down on a stone and waited\\nfor what would happen then he saw a peasants waggon coming towards\\nhim and a woman was standing upright in the middle of it instead of\\nsitting on the bundle of straw which was lying beside her or walking\\nnear the oxen and leading them the man thought to himself that is\\ncertainly one of the kind i am in search of and jumped up and ran\\nbackwards and forwards in front of the waggon like one who is not very\\nwise what do you want my friend said the woman to him i dont\\nknow you where do you come from i have fallen down from heaven\\nreplied the man and dont know how to get back again couldnt you\\ndrive me up no said the woman i dont know the way but if you\\ncome from heaven you can surely tell me how my husband who has been\\nthere these three years is you must have seen him oh yes i have\\nseen him but all men cant get on well he keeps sheep and the sheep\\ngive him a great deal to do they run up the mountains and lose their\\nway in the wilderness and he has to run after them and drive them\\ntogether again his clothes are all torn to pieces too and will soon\\nfall off his body there is no tailor there for saint peter wont let\\nany of them in as you know by the story who would have thought it\\ncried the woman i tell you what i will fetch his sunday coat which\\nis still hanging at home in the cupboard he can wear that and look\\nrespectable you will be so kind as to take it with you that wont\\ndo very well answered the peasant people are not allowed to take\\nclothes into heaven they are taken away from one at the gate then\\nhark you said the woman i sold my fine wheat yesterday and got a\\ngood lot of money for it i will send that to him if you hide the\\npurse in your pocket no one will know that you have it if you cant\\nmanage it any other way said the peasant i will do you that favor\\njust sit still where you are said she and i will drive home and\\nfetch the purse i shall soon be back again i do not sit down on the\\nbundle of straw but stand up in the waggon because it makes it\\nlighter for the cattle she drove her oxen away and the peasant\\nthought that woman has a perfect talent for folly if she really\\nbrings the money my wife may think herself fortunate for she will get\\nno beating it was not long before she came in a great hurry with the\\nmoney and with her own hands put it in his pocket before she went\\naway she thanked him again a thousand times for his courtesy\\n\\nwhen the woman got home again she found her son who had come in from\\nthe field she told him what unlookedfor things had befallen her and\\nthen added i am truly delighted at having found an opportunity of\\nsending something to my poor husband who would ever have imagined that\\nhe could be suffering for want of anything up in heaven the son was\\nfull of astonishment mother said he it is not every day that a\\nman comes from heaven in this way i will go out immediately and see\\nif he is still to be found he must tell me what it is like up there\\nand how the work is done he saddled the horse and rode off with all\\nspeed he found the peasant who was sitting under a willowtree and\\nwas just going to count the money in the purse have you seen the man\\nwho has fallen down from heaven cried the youth to him yes\\nanswered the peasant he has set out on his way back there and has\\ngone up that hill from whence it will be rather nearer you could\\nstill catch him up if you were to ride fast alas said the youth\\ni have been doing tiring work all day and the ride here has\\ncompletely worn me out you know the man be so kind as to get on my\\nhorse and go and persuade him to come here aha thought the\\npeasant here is another who has no wick in his lamp why should i\\nnot do you this favor said he and mounted the horse and rode off in\\na quick trot the youth remained sitting there till night fell but the\\npeasant never came back the man from heaven must certainly have been\\nin a great hurry and would not turn back thought he and the\\npeasant has no doubt given him the horse to take to my father he went\\nhome and told his mother what had happened and that he had sent his\\nfather the horse so that he might not have to be always running about\\nthou hast done well answered she thy legs are younger than his\\nand thou canst go on foot\\n\\nwhen the peasant got home he put the horse in the stable beside the\\ncow which he had as a pledge and then went to his wife and said\\ntrina as your luck would have it i have found two who are still\\nsillier fools than you this time you escape without a beating i will\\nstore it up for another occasion then he lighted his pipe sat down\\nin his grandfathers chair and said it was a good stroke of business\\nto get a sleek horse and a great purse full of money into the bargain\\nfor two lean cows if stupidity always brought in as much as that i\\nwould be quite willing to hold it in honor so thought the peasant\\nbut you no doubt prefer the simple folks',\n",

       " 'in a certain mill lived an old miller who had neither wife nor child\\nand three apprentices served under him as they had been with him\\nseveral years he one day said to them i am old and want to sit in\\nthe chimneycorner go out and whichsoever of you brings me the best\\nhorse home to him will i give the mill and in return for it he shall\\ntake care of me till my death the third of the boys was however the\\ndrudge who was looked on as foolish by the others they begrudged the\\nmill to him and afterwards he would not have it then all three went\\nout together and when they came to the village the two said to stupid\\nhans thou mayst just as well stay here as long as thou livest thou\\nwilt never get a horse hans however went with them and when it was\\nnight they came to a cave in which they lay down to sleep the two\\nsharp ones waited until hans had fallen asleep then they got up and\\nwent away leaving him where he was and they thought they had done a\\nvery clever thing but it was certain to turn out ill for them when\\nthe sun arose and hans woke up he was lying in a deep cavern he\\nlooked around on every side and exclaimed oh heavens where am i\\nthen he got up and clambered out of the cave went into the forest and\\nthought here i am quite alone and deserted how shall i obtain a\\nhorse now whilst he was thus walking full of thought he met a small\\ntabbycat which said quite kindly hans where are you going alas\\nthou canst not help me i well know your desire said the cat you\\nwish to have a beautiful horse come with me and be my faithful\\nservant for seven years long and then i will give you one more\\nbeautiful than any you have ever seen in your whole life well this\\nis a wonderful cat thought hans but i am determined to see if she\\nis telling the truth so she took him with her into her enchanted\\ncastle where there were nothing but cats who were her servants they\\nleapt nimbly upstairs and downstairs and were merry and happy in the\\nevening when they sat down to dinner three of them had to make music\\none played the bassoon the other the fiddle and the third put the\\ntrumpet to his lips and blew out his cheeks as much as he possibly\\ncould when they had dined the table was carried away and the cat\\nsaid now hans come and dance with me no said he i wont\\ndance with a pussy cat i have never done that yet then take him to\\nbed said she to the cats so one of them lighted him to his bedroom\\none pulled his shoes off one his stockings and at last one of them\\nblew out the candle next morning they returned and helped him out of\\nbed one put his stockings on for him one tied his garters one\\nbrought his shoes one washed him and one dried his face with her\\ntail that feels very soft said hans he however had to serve the\\ncat and chop some wood every day and to do that he had an axe of\\nsilver and the wedge and saw were of silver and the mallet of copper\\nso he chopped the wood small stayed there in the house and had good\\nmeat and drink but never saw anyone but the tabbycat and her\\nservants once she said to him go and mow my meadow and dry the\\ngrass and gave him a scythe of silver and a whetstone of gold but\\nbade him deliver them up again carefully so hans went thither and did\\nwhat he was bidden and when he had finished the work he carried the\\nscythe whetstone and hay to the house and asked if it was not yet\\ntime for her to give him his reward no said the cat you must\\nfirst do something more for me of the same kind there is timber of\\nsilver carpenters axe square and everything that is needful all of\\nsilver with these build me a small house then hans built the small\\nhouse and said that he had now done everything and still he had no\\nhorse nevertheless the seven years had gone by with him as if they\\nwere six months the cat asked him if he would like to see her horses\\nyes said hans then she opened the door of the small house and when\\nshe had opened it there stood twelve horses such horses so bright\\nand shining that his heart rejoiced at the sight of them and now she\\ngave him to eat and drink and said go home i will not give thee thy\\nhorse away with thee but in three days time i will follow thee and\\nbring it so hans set out and she showed him the way to the mill she\\nhad however never once given him a new coat and he had been obliged\\nto keep on his dirty old smockfrock which he had brought with him\\nand which during the seven years had everywhere become too small for\\nhim when he reached home the two other apprentices were there again\\nas well and each of them certainly had brought a horse with him but\\none of them was a blind one and the other lame they asked hans where\\nhis horse was it will follow me in three days time then they\\nlaughed and said indeed stupid hans where wilt thou get a horse\\nit will be a fine one hans went into the parlour but the miller\\nsaid he should not sit down to table for he was so ragged and torn\\nthat they would all be ashamed of him if any one came in so they gave\\nhim a mouthful of food outside and at night when they went to rest\\nthe two others would not let him have a bed and at last he was forced\\nto creep into the goosehouse and lie down on a little hard straw in\\nthe morning when he awoke the three days had passed and a coach came\\nwith six horses and they shone so bright that it was delightful to see\\nthem and a servant brought a seventh as well which was for the poor\\nmillers boy and a magnificent princess alighted from the coach and\\nwent into the mill and this princess was the little tabbycat whom\\npoor hans had served for seven years she asked the miller where the\\nmillers boy and drudge was then the miller said we cannot have him\\nhere in the mill for he is so ragged he is lying in the goosehouse\\nthen the kings daughter said that they were to bring him immediately\\nso they brought him out and he had to hold his little smockfrock\\ntogether to cover himself the servants unpacked splendid garments and\\nwashed him and dressed him and when that was done no king could have\\nlooked more handsome then the maiden desired to see the horses which\\nthe other apprentices had brought home with them and one of them was\\nblind and the other lame so she ordered the servant to bring the\\nseventh horse and when the miller saw it he said that such a horse as\\nthat had never yet entered his yard and that is for the third\\nmillers boy said she then he must have the mill said the miller\\nbut the kings daughter said that the horse was there and that he was\\nto keep his mill as well and took her faithful hans and set him in the\\ncoach and drove away with him they first drove to the little house\\nwhich he had built with the silver tools and behold it was a great\\ncastle and everything inside it was of silver and gold and then she\\nmarried him and he was rich so rich

       " 'hill and vale do not come together but the children of men do good\\nand bad in this way a shoemaker and a tailor once met with each other\\nin their travels the tailor was a handsome little fellow who was\\nalways merry and full of enjoyment he saw the shoemaker coming towards\\nhim from the other side and as he observed by his bag what kind of a\\ntrade he plied he sang a little mocking song to him\\n\\nsew me the seam\\ndraw me the thread\\nspread it over with pitch\\nknock the nail on the head\\n\\n\\nthe shoemaker however could not endure a joke he pulled a face as if\\nhe had drunk vinegar and made a gesture as if he were about to seize\\nthe tailor by the throat but the little fellow began to laugh reached\\nhim his bottle and said no harm was meant take a drink and swallow\\nyour anger down the shoemaker took a very hearty drink and the storm\\non his face began to clear away he gave the bottle back to the tailor\\nand said i spoke civilly to you one speaks well after much drinking\\nbut not after much thirst shall we travel together all right\\nanswered the tailor if only it suits you to go into a big town where\\nthere is no lack of work that is just where i want to go answered\\nthe shoemaker in a small nest there is nothing to earn and in the\\ncountry people like to go barefoot they travelled therefore onwards\\ntogether and always set one foot before the other like a weasel in the\\nsnow\\n\\nboth of them had time enough but little to bite and to break when\\nthey reached a town they went about and paid their respects to the\\ntradesmen and because the tailor looked so lively and merry and had\\nsuch pretty red cheeks every one gave him work willingly and when\\nluck was good the masters daughters gave him a kiss beneath the porch\\nas well when he again fell in with the shoemaker the tailor had\\nalways the most in his bundle the illtempered shoemaker made a wry\\nface and thought the greater the rascal the more the luck but the\\ntailor began to laugh and to sing and shared all he got with his\\ncomrade if a couple of pence jingled in his pockets he ordered good\\ncheer and thumped the table in his joy till the glasses danced and it\\nwas lightly come lightly go with him\\n\\nwhen they had travelled for some time they came to a great forest\\nthrough which passed the road to the capital two footpaths however\\nled through it one of which was a seven days journey and the other\\nonly two but neither of the travellers knew which way was the short\\none they seated themselves beneath an oaktree and took counsel\\ntogether how they should forecast and for how many days they should\\nprovide themselves with bread the shoemaker said one must look\\nbefore one leaps i will take with me bread for a week what said\\nthe tailor drag bread for seven days on ones back like a beast of\\nburden and not be able to look about i shall trust in god and not\\ntrouble myself about anything the money i have in my pocket is as good\\nin summer as in winter but in hot weather bread gets dry and mouldy\\ninto the bargain even my coat does not go as far as it might besides\\nwhy should we not find the right way bread for two days and thats\\nenough each therefore bought his own bread and then they tried\\ntheir luck in the forest\\n\\nit was as quiet there as in a church no wind stirred no brook\\nmurmured no bird sang and through the thicklyleaved branches no\\nsunbeam forced its way the shoemaker spoke never a word the heavy\\nbread weighed down his back until the perspiration streamed down his\\ncross and gloomy face the tailor however was quite merry he jumped\\nabout whistled on a leaf or sang a song and thought to himself god\\nin heaven must be pleased to see me so happy\\n\\nthis lasted two days but on the third the forest would not come to an\\nend and the tailor had eaten up all his bread so after all his heart\\nsank down a yard deeper in the meantime he did not lose courage but\\nrelied on god and on his luck on the third day he lay down in the\\nevening hungry under a tree and rose again next morning hungry still\\nso also passed the fourth day and when the shoemaker seated himself on\\na fallen tree and devoured his dinner the tailor was only a lookeron\\nif he begged for a little piece of bread the other laughed mockingly\\nand said thou hast always been so merry now thou canst try for once\\nwhat it is to be sad the birds which sing too early in the morning are\\nstruck by the hawk in the evening in short he was pitiless but on\\nthe fifth morning the poor tailor could no longer stand up and was\\nhardly able to utter one word for weakness his cheeks were white and\\nhis eyes red then the shoemaker said to him i will give thee a bit\\nof bread today but in return for it i will put out thy right eye\\nthe unhappy tailor who still wished to save his life could not do it\\nin any other way he wept once more with both eyes and then held them\\nout and the shoemaker who had a heart of stone put out his right eye\\nwith a sharp knife the tailor called to remembrance what his mother\\nhad formerly said to him when he had been eating secretly in the\\npantry eat what one can and suffer what one must when he had\\nconsumed his dearlybought bread he got on his legs again forgot his\\nmisery and comforted himself with the thought that he could always see\\nenough with one eye but on the sixth day hunger made itself felt\\nagain and gnawed him almost to the heart in the evening he fell down\\nby a tree and on the seventh morning he could not raise himself up for\\nfaintness and death was close at hand then said the shoemaker i\\nwill show mercy and give thee bread once more but thou shalt not have\\nit for nothing i shall put out thy other eye for it and now the\\ntailor felt how thoughtless his life had been prayed to god for\\nforgiveness and said do what thou wilt i will bear what i must but\\nremember that our lord god does not always look on passively and that\\nan hour will come when the evil deed which thou hast done to me and\\nwhich i have not deserved of thee will be requited when times were\\ngood with me i shared what i had with thee my trade is of that kind\\nthat each stitch must always be exactly like the other if i no longer\\nhave my eyes and can sew no more i must go abegging at any rate do\\nnot leave me here alone when i am blind or i shall die of hunger the\\nshoemaker however who had driven god out of his heart took the knife\\nand put out his left eye then he gave him a bit of bread to eat held\\nout a stick to him and drew him on behind him\\n\\nwhen the sun went down they got out of the forest and before them in\\nthe open country stood the gallows thither the shoemaker guided the\\nblind tailor and then left him alone and went his way weariness\\npain and hunger made the wretched man fall asleep and he slept the\\nwhole night when day dawned he awoke but knew not where he lay two\\npoor sinners were hanging on the gallows and a crow sat on the head of\\neach of them then one of the men who had been hanged began to speak\\nand said brother art thou awake yes i am awake answered the\\nsecond then i will tell thee something said the first the dew\\nwhich this night has fallen down over us from the gallows gives every\\none who washes himself with it his eyes again if blind people did but\\nknow this how many would regain their sight who do not believe that to\\nbe possible\\n\\nwhen the tailor heard that he took his pockethandkerchief pressed it\\non the grass and when it was moist with dew washed the sockets of his\\neyes with it immediately was fulfilled what the man on the gallows had\\nsaid and a couple of healthy new eyes filled the sockets it was not\\nlong before the tailor saw the sun rise behind the mountains in the\\nplain before him lay the great royal city with its magnificent gates\\nand hundred towers and the golden balls and crosses which were on the\\nspires began to shine he could distinguish every leaf on the trees\\nsaw the birds which flew past and the midges which danced in the air\\nhe took a needle out of his pocket and as he could thread it as well\\nas ever he had done his heart danced with delight he threw himself on\\nhis knees thanked god for the mercy he had shown him and said his\\nmorning prayer he did not forget also to pray for the poor sinners who\\nwere hanging there swinging against each other in the wind like the\\npendulums of clocks then he took his bundle on his back and soon\\nforgot the pain of heart he had endured and went on his way singing\\nand whistling\\n\\nthe first thing he met was a brown foal running about the fields at\\nlarge he caught it by the mane and wanted to spring on it and ride\\ninto the town the foal however begged to be set free i am still\\ntoo young it said even a light tailor such as thou art would break\\nmy back in two let me go till i have grown strong a time may perhaps\\ncome when i may reward thee for it run off said the tailor i see\\nthou art still a giddy thing he gave it a touch with a switch over\\nits back whereupon it kicked up its hind legs for joy leapt over\\nhedges and ditches and galloped away into the open country\\n\\nbut the little tailor had eaten nothing since the day before the sun\\nto be sure fills my eyes said he but the bread does not fill my\\nmouth the first thing that comes across me and is even half edible\\nwill have to suffer for it in the meantime a stork stepped solemnly\\nover the meadow towards him halt halt cried the tailor and seized\\nhim by the leg i dont know if thou art good to eat or not but my\\nhunger leaves me no great choice i must cut thy head off and roast\\nthee dont do that replied the stork i am a sacred bird which\\nbrings mankind great profit and no one does me an injury leave me my\\nlife and i may do thee good in some other way well be off cousin\\nlonglegs said the tailor the stork rose up let its long legs hang\\ndown and flew gently away\\n\\nwhats to be the end of this said the tailor to himself at last my\\nhunger grows greater and greater and my stomach more and more empty\\nwhatsoever comes in my way now is lost at this moment he saw a couple\\nof young ducks which were on a pond come swimming towards him you\\ncome just at the right moment said he and laid hold of one of them\\nand was about to wring its neck on this an old duck which was hidden\\namong the reeds began to scream loudly and swam to him with open\\nbeak and begged him urgently to spare her dear children canst thou\\nnot imagine said she how thy mother would mourn if any one wanted\\nto carry thee off and give thee thy finishing stroke only be\\nquiet said the goodtempered tailor thou shalt keep thy children\\nand put the prisoner back into the water\\n\\nwhen he turned round he was standing in front of an old tree which was\\npartly hollow and saw some wild bees flying in and out of it there i\\nshall at once find the reward of my good deed said the tailor the\\nhoney will refresh me but the queenbee came out threatened him and\\nsaid if thou touchest my people and destroyest my nest our stings\\nshall pierce thy skin like ten thousand redhot needles but if thou\\nwilt leave us in peace and go thy way we will do thee a service for it\\nanother time\\n\\nthe little tailor saw that here also nothing was to be done three\\ndishes empty and nothing on the fourth is a bad dinner he dragged\\nhimself therefore with his starvedout stomach into the town and as it\\nwas just striking twelve all was readycooked for him in the inn and\\nhe was able to sit down at once to dinner when he was satisfied he\\nsaid now i will get to work he went round the town sought a\\nmaster and soon found a good situation as however he had thoroughly\\nlearnt his trade it was not long before he became famous and every\\none wanted to have his new coat made by the little tailor whose\\nimportance increased daily i can go no further in skill said he\\nand yet things improve every day at last the king appointed him\\ncourttailor\\n\\nbut how things do happen in the world on the very same day his former\\ncomrade the shoemaker also became courtshoemaker when the latter\\ncaught sight of the tailor and saw that he had once more two healthy\\neyes his conscience troubled him before he takes revenge on me\\nthought he to himself i must dig a pit for him he however who\\ndigs a pit for another falls into it himself in the evening when work\\nwas over and it had grown dusk he stole to the king and said lord\\nking the tailor is an arrogant fellow and has boasted that he will get\\nthe gold crown back again which was lost in ancient times that would\\nplease me very much said the king and he caused the tailor to be\\nbrought before him next morning and ordered him to get the crown back\\nagain or to leave the town for ever oho thought the tailor a\\nrogue gives more than he has got if the surly king wants me to do what\\ncan be done by no one i will not wait till morning but will go out of\\nthe town at once today he packed up his bundle therefore but when\\nhe was without the gate he could not help being sorry to give up his\\ngood fortune and turn his back on the town in which all had gone so\\nwell with him he came to the pond where he had made the acquaintance\\nof the ducks at that very moment the old one whose young ones he had\\nspared was sitting there by the shore pluming herself with her beak\\nshe knew him again instantly and asked why he was hanging his head so\\nthou wilt not be surprised when thou hearest what has befallen me\\nreplied the tailor and told her his fate if that be all said the\\nduck we can help thee the crown fell into the water and lies down\\nbelow at the bottom we will soon bring it up again for thee in the\\nmeantime just spread out thy handkerchief on the bank she dived down\\nwith her twelve young ones and in five minutes she was up again and\\nsat with the crown resting on her wings and the twelve young ones were\\nswimming round about and had put their beaks under it and were helping\\nto carry it they swam to the shore and put the crown on the\\nhandkerchief no one can imagine how magnificent the crown was when\\nthe sun shone on it it gleamed like a hundred thousand carbuncles the\\ntailor tied his handkerchief together by the four corners and carried\\nit to the king who was full of joy and put a gold chain round the\\ntailors neck\\n\\nwhen the shoemaker saw that one stroke had failed he contrived a\\nsecond and went to the king and said lord king the tailor has\\nbecome insolent again he boasts that he will copy in wax the whole of\\nthe royal palace with everything that pertains to it loose or fast\\ninside and out the king sent for the tailor and ordered him to copy\\nin wax the whole of the royal palace with everything that pertained to\\nit movable or immovable within and without and if he did not succeed\\nin doing this or if so much as one nail on the wall were wanting he\\nshould be imprisoned for his whole life under ground\\n\\nthe tailor thought it gets worse and worse no one can endure that\\nand threw his bundle on his back and went forth when he came to the\\nhollow tree he sat down and hung his head the bees came flying out\\nand the queenbee asked him if he had a stiff neck since he held his\\nhead so awry alas no answered the tailor something quite\\ndifferent weighs me down and he told her what the king had demanded\\nof him the bees began to buzz and hum amongst themselves and the\\nqueenbee said just go home again but come back tomorrow at this\\ntime and bring a large sheet with you and then all will be well so\\nhe turned back again but the bees flew to the royal palace and\\nstraight into it through the open windows crept round about into every\\ncorner and inspected everything most carefully then they hurried back\\nand modelled the palace in wax with such rapidity that any one looking\\non would have thought it was growing before his eyes by the evening\\nall was ready and when the tailor came next morning the whole of the\\nsplendid building was there and not one nail in the wall or tile of\\nthe roof was wanting and it was delicate withal and white as snow\\nand smelt sweet as honey the tailor wrapped it carefully in his cloth\\nand took it to the king who could not admire it enough placed it in\\nhis largest hall and in return for it presented the tailor with a\\nlarge stone house\\n\\nthe shoemaker however did not give up but went for the third time to\\nthe king and said lord king it has come to the tailors ears that no\\nwater will spring up in the courtyard of the castle and he has\\nboasted that it shall rise up in the midst of the courtyard to a mans\\nheight and be clear as crystal then the king ordered the tailor to be\\nbrought before him and said if a stream of water does not rise in my\\ncourtyard by tomorrow as thou hast promised the executioner shall in\\nthat very place make thee shorter by the head the poor tailor did not\\ntake long to think about it but hurried out to the gate and because\\nthis time it was a matter of life and death to him tears rolled down\\nhis face whilst he was thus going forth full of sorrow the foal to\\nwhich he had formerly given its liberty and which had now become a\\nbeautiful chestnut horse came leaping towards him the time has\\ncome it said to the tailor when i can repay thee for thy good deed\\ni know already what is needful to thee but thou shalt soon have help\\nget on me my back can carry two such as thou the tailors courage\\ncame back to him he jumped up in one bound and the horse went full\\nspeed into the town and right up to the courtyard of the castle it\\ngalloped as quick as lightning thrice round it and at the third time\\nit fell violently down at the same instant however there was a\\nterrific clap of thunder a fragment of earth in the middle of the\\ncourtyard sprang like a cannonball into the air and over the castle\\nand directly after it a jet of water rose as high as a man on\\nhorseback and the water was as pure as crystal and the sunbeams began\\nto dance on it when the king saw that he arose in amazement and went\\nand embraced the tailor in the sight of all men\\n\\nbut good fortune did not last long the king had daughters in plenty\\none still prettier than the other but he had no son so the malicious\\nshoemaker betook himself for the fourth time to the king and said\\nlord king the tailor has not given up his arrogance he has now\\nboasted that if he liked he could cause a son to be brought to the\\nlord king through the air the king commanded the tailor to be\\nsummoned and said if thou causest a son to be brought to me within\\nnine days thou shalt have my eldest daughter to wife the reward is\\nindeed great thought the little tailor one would willingly do\\nsomething for it but the cherries grow too high for me if i climb for\\nthem the bough will break beneath me and i shall fall\\n\\nhe went home seated himself crosslegged on his worktable and\\nthought over what was to be done it cant be managed cried he at\\nlast i will go away after all i cant live in peace here he tied\\nup his bundle and hurried away to the gate when he got to the meadow\\nhe perceived his old friend the stork who was walking backwards and\\nforwards like a philosopher sometimes he stood still took a frog into\\nclose consideration and at length swallowed it down the stork came to\\nhim and greeted him i see he began that thou hast thy pack on thy\\nback why art thou leaving the town the tailor told him what the king\\nhad required of him and how he could not perform it and lamented his\\nmisfortune dont let thy hair grow grey about that said the stork\\ni will help thee out of thy difficulty for a long time now i have\\ncarried the children in swaddlingclothes into the town so for once in\\na way i can fetch a little prince out of the well go home and be easy\\nin nine days from this time repair to the royal palace and there will\\ni come the little tailor went home and at the appointed time was at\\nthe castle it was not long before the stork came flying thither and\\ntapped at the window the tailor opened it and cousin longlegs came\\ncarefully in and walked with solemn steps over the smooth marble\\npavement he had moreover a baby in his beak that was as lovely as an\\nangel and stretched out its little hands to the queen the stork laid\\nit in her lap and she caressed it and kissed it and was beside\\nherself with delight before the stork flew away he took his\\ntravelling bag off his back and handed it over to the queen in it\\nthere were little paper parcels with colored sweetmeats and they were\\ndivided amongst the little princesses the eldest however had none of\\nthem but got the merry tailor for a husband it seems to me said\\nhe just as if i had won the highest prize my mother was if right\\nafter all she always said that whoever trusts in god and only has good\\nluck can never fail\\n\\nthe shoemaker had to make the shoes in which the little tailor danced\\nat the wedding festival after which he was commanded to quit the town\\nfor ever the road to the forest led him to the gallows worn out with\\nanger rage and the heat of the day he threw himself down when he\\nhad closed his eyes and was about to sleep the two crows flew down\\nfrom the heads of the men who were hanging there and pecked his eyes\\nout in his madness he ran into the forest and must have died there of\\nhunger for no one has ever either seen him again or heard of him',\n",
       " 'there was once a countryman who had money and land in plenty but how\\nrich soever he was one thing was still wanting in his happiness he had\\nno children often when he went into the town with the other peasants\\nthey mocked him and asked why he had no children at last he became\\nangry and when he got home he said i will have a child even if it\\nbe a hedgehog then his wife had a child that was a hedgehog in the\\nupper part of his body and a boy in the lower and when she saw the\\nchild she was terrified and said see there thou hast brought\\nillluck on us then said the man what can be done now the boy must\\nbe christened but we shall not be able to get a godfather for him\\nthe woman said and we cannot call him anything else but hans the\\nhedgehog\\n\\nwhen he was christened the parson said he cannot go into any\\nordinary bed because of his spikes so a little straw was put behind\\nthe stove and hans the hedgehog was laid on it his mother could not\\nsuckle him for he would have pricked her with his quills so he lay\\nthere behind the stove for eight years and his father was tired of him\\nand thought if he would but die he did not die however but\\nremained lying there now it happened that there was a fair in the\\ntown and the peasant was about to go to it and asked his wife what he\\nshould bring back with him for her a little meat and a couple of\\nwhite rolls which are wanted for the house said she then he asked\\nthe servant and she wanted a pair of slippers and some stockings with\\nclocks at last he said also and what wilt thou have hans my\\nhedgehog dear father he said do bring me bagpipes when\\ntherefore the father came home again he gave his wife what he had\\nbought for her meat and white rolls and then he gave the maid the\\nslippers and the stockings with clocks and lastly he went behind\\nthe stove and gave hans the hedgehog the bagpipes and when hans the\\nhedgehog had the bagpipes he said dear father do go to the forge\\nand get the cock shod and then i will ride away and never come back\\nagain on this the father was delighted to think that he was going to\\nget rid of him and had the cock shod for him and when it was done\\nhans the hedgehog got on it and rode away but took swine and asses\\nwith him which he intended to keep in the forest when they got there\\nhe made the cock fly on to a high tree with him and there he sat for\\nmany a long year and watched his asses and swine until the herd was\\nquite large and his father knew nothing about him while he was\\nsitting in the tree however he played his bagpipes and made music\\nwhich was very beautiful once a king came travelling by who had lost\\nhis way and heard the music he was astonished at it and sent his\\nservant forth to look all round and see from whence this music came he\\nspied about but saw nothing but a little animal sitting up aloft on\\nthe tree which looked like a cock with a hedgehog on it which made\\nthis music then the king told the servant he was to ask why he sat\\nthere and if he knew the road which led to his kingdom so hans the\\nhedgehog descended from the tree and said he would show the way if the\\nking would write a bond and promise him whatever he first met in the\\nroyal courtyard as soon as he arrived at home then the king thought\\ni can easily do that hans the hedgehog understands nothing and i can\\nwrite what i like so the king took pen and ink and wrote something\\nand when he had done it hans the hedgehog showed him the way and he\\ngot safely home but his daughter when she saw him from afar was so\\noverjoyed that she ran to meet him and kissed him then he remembered\\nhans the hedgehog and told her what had happened and that he had been\\nforced to promise whatsoever first met him when he got home to a very\\nstrange animal which sat on a cock as if it were a horse and made\\nbeautiful music but that instead of writing that he should have what\\nhe wanted he had written that he should not have it thereupon the\\nprincess was glad and said he had done well for she never would have\\ngone away with the hedgehog\\n\\nhans the hedgehog however looked after his asses and pigs and was\\nalways merry and sat on the tree and played his bagpipes\\n\\nnow it came to pass that another king came journeying by with his\\nattendants and runners and he also had lost his way and did not know\\nhow to get home again because the forest was so large he likewise\\nheard the beautiful music from a distance and asked his runner what\\nthat could be and told him to go and see then the runner went under\\nthe tree and saw the cock sitting at the top of it and hans the\\nhedgehog on the cock the runner asked him what he was about up there\\ni am keeping my asses and my pigs but what is your desire the\\nmessenger said that they had lost their way and could not get back\\ninto their own kingdom and asked if he would not show them the way\\nthen hans the hedgehog got down the tree with the cock and told the\\naged king that he would show him the way if he would give him for his\\nown whatsoever first met him in front of his royal palace the king\\nsaid yes and wrote a promise to hans the hedgehog that he should\\nhave this that done hans rode on before him on the cock and pointed\\nout the way and the king reached his kingdom again in safety when he\\ngot to the courtyard there were great rejoicings now he had an only\\ndaughter who was very beautiful she ran to meet him threw her arms\\nround his neck and was delighted to have her old father back again\\nshe asked him where in the world he had been so long so he told her\\nhow he had lost his way and had very nearly not come back at all but\\nthat as he was travelling through a great forest a creature half\\nhedgehog half man who was sitting astride a cock in a high tree and\\nmaking music had shown him the way and helped him to get out but that\\nin return he had promised him whatsoever first met him in the royal\\ncourtyard and how that was she herself which made him unhappy now\\nbut on this she promised that for love of her father she would\\nwillingly go with this hans if he came\\n\\nhans the hedgehog however took care of his pigs and the pigs\\nmultiplied until they became so many in number that the whole forest\\nwas filled with them then hans the hedgehog resolved not to live in\\nthe forest any longer and sent word to his father to have every stye\\nin the village emptied for he was coming with such a great herd that\\nall might kill who wished to do so when his father heard that he was\\ntroubled for he thought hans the hedgehog had died long ago hans the\\nhedgehog however seated himself on the cock and drove the pigs\\nbefore him into the village and ordered the slaughter to begin ha\\nbut there was a killing and a chopping that might have been heard two\\nmiles off after this hans the hedgehog said father let me have the\\ncock shod once more at the forge and then i will ride away and never\\ncome back as long as i live then the father had the cock shod once\\nmore and was pleased that hans the hedgehog would never return again\\n\\nhans the hedgehog rode away to the first kingdom there the king had\\ncommanded that whosoever came mounted on a cock and had bagpipes with\\nhim should be shot at cut down or stabbed by everyone so that he\\nmight not enter the palace when therefore hans the hedgehog came\\nriding thither they all pressed forward against him with their pikes\\nbut he spurred the cock and it flew up over the gate in front of the\\nkings window and lighted there and hans cried that the king must give\\nhim what he had promised or he would take both his life and his\\ndaughters then the king began to speak his daughter fair and to beg\\nher to go away with hans in order to save her own life and her\\nfathers so she dressed herself in white and her father gave her a\\ncarriage with six horses and magnificent attendants together with gold\\nand possessions she seated herself in the carriage and placed hans\\nthe hedgehog beside her with the cock and the bagpipes and then they\\ntook leave and drove away and the king thought he should never see her\\nagain he was however deceived in his expectation for when they were\\nat a short distance from the town hans the hedgehog took her pretty\\nclothes off and pierced her with his hedgehogs skin until she bled\\nall over that is the reward of your falseness said he go your\\nway i will not have you and on that he chased her home again and\\nshe was disgraced for the rest of her life\\n\\nhans the hedgehog however rode on further on the cock with his\\nbagpipes to the dominions of the second king to whom he had shown the\\nway this one however had arranged that if any one resembling hans\\nthe hedgehog should come they were to present arms give him safe\\nconduct cry long life to him and lead him to the royal palace\\n\\nbut when the kings daughter saw him she was terrified for he looked\\nquite too strange she remembered however that she could not change\\nher mind for she had given her promise to her father so hans the\\nhedgehog was welcomed by her and married to her and had to go with\\nher to the royal table and she seated herself by his side and they\\nate and drank when the evening came and they wanted to go to sleep\\nshe was afraid of his quills but he told her she was not to fear for\\nno harm would befall her and he told the old king that he was to\\nappoint four men to watch by the door of the chamber and light a great\\nfire and when he entered the room and was about to get into bed he\\nwould creep out of his hedgehogs skin and leave it lying there by the\\nbedside and that the men were to run nimbly to it throw it in the\\nfire and stay by it until it was consumed when the clock struck\\neleven he went into the chamber stripped off the hedgehogs skin and\\nleft it lying by the bed then came the men and fetched it swiftly and\\nthrew it in the fire and when the fire had consumed it he was\\ndelivered and lay there in bed in human form but he was coalblack as\\nif he had been burnt the king sent for his physician who washed him\\nwith precious salves and anointed him and he became white and was a\\nhandsome young man when the kings daughter saw that she was glad and\\nthe next morning they arose joyfully ate and drank and then the\\nmarriage was properly solemnized and hans the hedgehog received the\\nkingdom from the aged king\\n\\nwhen several years had passed he went with his wife to his father and\\nsaid that he was his son the father however declared he had no son\\nhe had never had but one and he had been born like a hedgehog with\\nspikes and had gone forth into the world then hans made himself\\nknown and the old father rejoiced and went with him to his kingdom\\n\\nmy tale is done\\nand away it has run\\nto little augusts house',\n",

one desire more said the servant to himself\\nand went merrily onwards soon afterwards he met a jew with a long\\ngoatsbeard who was standing listening to the song of a bird which\\nwas sitting up at the top of a tree good heavens he was exclaiming\\nthat such a small creature should have such a fearfully loud voice if\\nit were but mine if only someone would sprinkle some salt upon

him all over the\\nbody oh dear cried the jew what do i want with your fiddling\\nleave the fiddle alone master i do not want to dance\\n\\nbut the servant did not listen to him and thought you have fleeced\\npeople often enough now the thornbushes shall do the same to you\\nand he began to play over again so that the jew had to jump higher\\nthan ever and scraps of his coat were left hanging on the thorns oh\\nwoes me cried the jew i will give the gentleman whatsoever he asks\\nif only he leaves off fiddling a purse full of gold if you are so\\nliberal said the servant i will stop my music but this i must say\\nto your credit that you dance to it so well that it is quite an art\\nand having taken the purse he went his way\\n\\nthe jew stood still and watched the servant quietly until he was far\\noff and out of sight and then he screamed out with all his might you\\nmiserable musician you beerhouse fiddler wait till i catch you\\nalone i will hunt you till the soles of your shoes fall off you\\nragamuffin just put five farthings in your mouth and then you may be\\nworth three halfpence and went on abusing him as fast as he could\\nspeak as soon as he had refreshed himself a

let the man be thrown into\\nprison\\n\\nwas it a soldier said the judge who cut you thus with his sabre\\nnothing of the sort said the jew it was no sword that he had but\\na gun hanging at his back and a fiddle at his neck the wretch may\\neasily be known\\n\\nso the judge sent his people out after the man and they found the good\\nservant who had been going quite slowly along and they found too\\nthe purse with the money upon him as soon as he was taken before the\\njudge he said i did not touch the jew nor take his money he gave it\\nto me of his own free will that i might leave off

you vagabond you\\ndog of a fiddler now you are going to receive your wellearned\\nreward the servant walked quietly with the hangman up the ladder but\\nupon the last step he turned round and said to the judge grant me\\njust one request before i die\\n\\nyes if you do not ask your life said the judge i do not ask for\\nlife answered the servant but as a last favor let me play once more\\nupon my

fat and lean one with another the dogs\\nlikewise which had run there got up on their hind legs and capered\\nabout and the longer he played the higher sprang the dancers so that\\nthey knocked against each others heads and began to shriek terribly\\n\\nat length the judge cried quite out of breath i will give you your\\nlife if you will only stop fiddling the good servant thereupon had\\ncompassion took his fiddle and hung it round his neck again and\\nstepped down the ladder then he went up to the jew who was lying upon\\nthe ground panting for breath and said you rascal now

       " 'there was once a young fellow who had learnt the trade of locksmith\\nand told his father he would now go out into the world and seek his\\nfortune very well said the father i am quite content with that\\nand gave him some money for his journey so he travelled about and\\nlooked for work after a time he resolved not to follow the trade of\\nlocksmith any more for he no longer liked it but he took a fancy for\\nhunting then there met him in his rambles a huntsman dressed in green\\nwho asked whence he came and whither he was going the youth said he\\nwas a locksmiths apprentice but that the trade no longer pleased him\\nand he had a liking for huntsmanship would he teach it to him oh\\nyes said the huntsman if thou wilt go with me then the young\\nfellow went with him bound himself to him for some years and learnt\\nthe art of hunting after this he wished to try his luck elsewhere and\\nthe huntsman gave him nothing in the way of payment but an airgun\\nwhich had however this property that it hit its mark without fail\\nwhenever he shot with it then he set out and found himself in a very\\nlarge forest which he could not get to the end of in one day when\\nevening came he seated himself in a high tree in order to escape from\\nthe wild beasts towards midnight it seemed to him as if a tiny little\\nlight glimmered in the distance then he looked down through the\\nbranches towards it and kept well in his mind where it was but in the\\nfirst place he took off his hat and threw it down in the direction of\\nthe light so that he might go to the hat as a mark when he had\\ndescended then he got down and went to his hat put it on again and\\nwent straight forwards the farther he went the larger the light grew\\nand when he got close to it he saw that it was an enormous fire and\\nthat three giants were sitting by it who had an ox on the spit and\\nwere roasting it presently one of them said i must just taste if the\\nmeat will soon be fit to eat and pulled a piece off and was about to\\nput it in his mouth when the huntsman shot it out of his hand well\\nreally said the giant if the wind has not blown the bit out of my\\nhand and helped himself to another but when he was just about to\\nbite into it the huntsman again shot it away from him on this the\\ngiant gave the one who was sitting next him a box on the ear and cried\\nangrily why art thou snatching my piece away from me i have not\\nsnatched it away said the other a sharpshooter must have shot it\\naway from thee the giant took another piece but could not however\\nkeep it in his hand for the huntsman shot it out then the giant said\\nthat must be a good shot to shoot the bit out of ones very mouth\\nsuch an one would be useful to us and he cried aloud come here\\nthou sharpshooter seat thyself at the fire beside us and eat thy fill\\nwe will not hurt thee but if thou wilt not come and we have to bring\\nthee by force thou art a lost man on this the youth went up to them\\nand told them he was a skilled huntsman and that whatever he aimed at\\nwith his gun he was certain to hit then they said if he would go with\\nthem he should be well treated and they told him that outside the\\nforest there was a great lake behind which stood a tower and in the\\ntower was imprisoned a lovely princess whom they wished very much to\\ncarry off yes said he i will soon get her for you then they\\nadded but there is still something else there is a tiny little dog\\nwhich begins to bark directly any one goes near and as soon as it\\nbarks every one in the royal palace wakens up and for this reason we\\ncannot get there canst thou undertake to shoot it dead yes said\\nhe that will be a little bit of fun for me after this he got into a\\nboat and rowed over the lake and as soon as he landed the little dog\\ncame running out and was about to bark but the huntsman took his\\nairgun and shot it dead when the giants saw that they rejoiced and\\nthought they already had the kings daughter safe but the huntsman\\nwished first to see how matters stood and told them that they must\\nstay outside until he called them then he went into the castle and\\nall was perfectly quiet within and every one was asleep when he\\nopened the door of the first room a sword was hanging on the wall\\nwhich was made of pure silver and there was a golden star on it and\\nthe name of the king and on a table near it lay a sealed letter which\\nhe broke open and inside it was written that whosoever had the sword\\ncould kill everything which opposed him so he took the sword from the\\nwall hung it at his side and went onwards then he entered the room\\nwhere the kings daughter was lying sleeping and she was so beautiful\\nthat he stood still and holding his breath looked at her he thought\\nto himself how can i give an innocent maiden into the power of the\\nwild giants who have evil in their minds he looked about further\\nand under the bed stood a pair of slippers on the right one was her\\nfathers name with a star and on the left her own name with a star\\nshe wore also a great neckkerchief of silk embroidered with gold and\\non the right side was her fathers name and on the left her own all\\nin golden letters then the huntsman took a pair of scissors and cut\\nthe right corner off and put it in his knapsack and then he also took\\nthe right slipper with the kings name and thrust that in now the\\nmaiden still lay sleeping and she was quite sewn into her nightdress\\nand he cut a morsel from this also and thrust it in with the rest but\\nhe did all without touching her then he went forth and left her lying\\nasleep undisturbed and when he came to the gate again the giants were\\nstill standing outside waiting for him and expecting that he was\\nbringing the princess but he cried to them that they were to come in\\nfor the maiden was already in their power that he could not open the\\ngate to them but there was a hole through which they must creep then\\nthe first approached and the huntsman wound the giants hair round his\\nhand pulled the head in and cut it off at one stroke with his sword\\nand then drew the rest of him in he called to the second and cut his\\nhead off likewise and then he killed the third also and he was well\\npleased that he had freed the beautiful maiden from her enemies and he\\ncut out their tongues and put them in his knapsack then thought he i\\nwill go home to my father and let him see what i have already done and\\nafterwards i will travel about the world the luck which god is pleased\\nto grant me will easily find me\\n\\nbut when the king in the castle awoke he saw the three giants lying\\nthere dead so he went into the sleepingroom of his daughter awoke\\nher and asked who could have killed the giants then said she dear\\nfather i know not i have been asleep but when she arose and would\\nhave put on her slippers the right one was gone and when she looked\\nat her neckkerchief it was cut and the right corner was missing and\\nwhen she looked at her nightdress a piece was cut out of it the king\\nsummoned his whole court together soldiers and every one else who was\\nthere and asked who had set his daughter at liberty and killed the\\ngiants now it happened that he had a captain who was oneeyed and a\\nhideous man and he said that he had done it then the old king said\\nthat as he had accomplished this he should marry his daughter but the\\nmaiden said rather than marry him dear father i will go away into\\nthe world as far as my legs can carry me but the king said that if\\nshe would not marry him she should take off her royal garments and wear\\npeasants clothing and go forth and that she should go to a potter\\nand begin a trade in earthen vessels so she put off her royal apparel\\nand went to a potter and borrowed crockery enough for a stall and she\\npromised him also that if she had sold it by the evening she would pay\\nfor it then the king said she was to seat herself in a corner with it\\nand sell it and he arranged with some peasants to drive over it with\\ntheir carts so that everything should be broken into a thousand\\npieces when therefore the kings daughter had placed her stall in the\\nstreet by came the carts and broke all she had into tiny fragments\\nshe began to weep and said alas how shall i ever pay for the pots\\nnow the king had however wished by this to force her to marry the\\ncaptain but instead of that she again went to the potter and asked\\nhim if he would lend to her once more he said no she must

the forest\\noutside and in it thou shalt stay all thy life long and cook for every\\none but thou shalt take no money for it when the hut was ready a\\nsign was hung on the door whereon was written today given tomorrow\\nsold there she remained a long time and it was rumored about the\\nworld that a maiden was there who cooked without asking for payment\\nand that this was set forth on a sign outside her door the huntsman\\nheard it likewise and thought to himself that would suit thee thou\\nart poor and hast no money so he took his airgun and his knapsack\\nwherein all the things which he had formerly carried away with him from\\nthe castle as tokens of his truthfulness were still lying and went\\ninto the forest and found the hut with the sign today given\\ntomorrow sold he had put on the sword with which he had cut off the\\nheads of the three giants and thus entered the hut and ordered\\nsomething to eat to be given to him he was charmed with the beautiful\\nmaiden who was indeed as lovely as any picture she asked him whence\\nhe came and whither he was going and he said i am roaming about the\\nworld then she asked him where he had got the sword for that truly\\nher fathers name was on it he asked her if she were the kings\\ndaughter yes answered she with this sword said he did i cut\\noff the heads of three giants and he took their tongues out of his\\nknapsack in proof then he also showed her the slipper and the corner\\nof the neckkerchief and the bit of the nightdress hereupon she was\\noverjoyed and said that he was the one who had delivered her on this\\nthey went together to the old king and fetched him to the hut and she\\nled him into her room and told him that the huntsman was the man who\\nhad really set her free from the giants and when the aged king saw all\\nthe proofs of this he could no longer doubt and said that he was very\\nglad he knew how everything had happened and that the huntsman should\\nhave her to wife on which the maiden was glad at heart then she\\ndressed the huntsman as if he were a foreign lord and the king ordered\\na feast to be prepared when they went to table the captain sat on the\\nleft side of the kings daughter but the huntsman was on the right\\nand the captain thought he was a foreign lord who had come on a visit\\nwhen they had eaten and drunk the old king said to the captain that he\\nwould set before him something which he must guess supposing any one\\nsaid that he had killed the three giants and he were asked where the\\ngiants tongues were and he were forced to go and look and there were\\nnone in their heads how could that happen the captain said then\\nthey cannot have had any not so said the king every animal has a\\ntongue and then he likewise asked what any one would deserve who made\\nsuch an answer the captain replied he ought to be torn in pieces\\nthen the king said he had pronounced his own sentence and the captain\\nwas put in prison and then torn in four pieces but the kings daughter\\nwas married to the huntsman after this he brought his father and\\nmother and they lived with their son in happiness and after the death\\nof the old king he received the

been the kings daughter said to it when my father calls\\ndo thou answer then the great tall stone image of st christopher\\nnodded quite half an hour with its head until at length the head stood\\nstill again and the kings son laid himself down on the threshold of\\nthe door and slept the next morning the king said thou hast indeed\\nwatched well but i cannot give thee my daughter now i have a great\\nforest if thou cuttest it down for me between six oclock this morning\\nand six at night i will think about it then he gave him a glass axe\\na glass wedge and a glass mallet when he got into the wood he began\\nat once to cut but the axe broke in two then he took the wedge and\\nstruck it once with the mallet and it became as short and as small as\\nsand then he was much troubled

the one by whom he last watched can take him something then the\\nyoungest was forced to go and take him something to eat when she got\\ninto the forest she asked him how he was getting on oh said he i\\nam getting on very badly then she said he was to come and just eat a\\nlittle nay said he i cannot do that i shall still have to die\\nso i will eat no more then she spoke so kindly to him and begged him\\njust to try that he came and ate something when he had eaten\\nsomething she said i will comb thy hair a while and then thou wilt\\nfeel happier\\n\\nso she combed his hair and he became weary and fell asleep and then\\nshe took her handkerchief and made a knot in it and struck it three\\ntimes on the earth and said earthworkers come forth in a moment\\nnumbers of little earthmen came forth and asked what the kings\\ndaughter commanded then said she in three hours time the great\\nforest must be cut down and the whole of the wood laid in heaps so\\nthe little earthmen went about and got together the whole of their\\nkindred to help them with the work they began at once and when the\\nthree hours were over all was done and they came back to the kings\\ndaughter and told her so then she took her white handkerchief again\\nand said earthworkers go home on this they all disappeared when\\nthe kings son awoke he was delighted and she said come home when\\nit has struck six oclock he did as she told him and then the king\\nasked hast thou made away with the forest yes said the kings\\nson when they were sitting at table the king said i cannot yet give\\nthee my daughter to wife thou must still do something more for her\\nsake so he asked what it was to be then i have a great fishpond\\nsaid the king thou must go to it tomorrow morning and clear it of\\nall mud until it is as bright as a mirror and fill it with every kind\\nof fish the next morning the king gave him a glass shovel and said\\nthe fishpond must be done by six oclock so he went away and when\\nhe came to the fishpond he stuck his shovel in the mud and it broke in\\ntwo then he stuck his hoe in the mud and broke it also then he was\\nmuch troubled at noon the youngest daughter brought him something to\\neat and asked him how he was getting on so the kings son said\\neverything was going very ill with him and he would certainly have to\\nlose his head my tools have broken to pieces again oh said she\\nthou must just come and eat something and then thou wilt be in\\nanother frame of mind no said he i cannot eat i am far too\\nunhappy for that then she gave him many good words until at last he\\ncame and ate something then she combed his hair again and he fell\\nasleep so once more she took her handkerchief tied a knot in it and\\nstruck the ground thrice with the knot and said earthworkers come\\nforth in a moment a great many little earthmen came and asked what\\nshe desired and she told them that in three hours time they must\\nhave the fishpond entirely cleaned out and it must be so clear that\\npeople could see themselves reflected in it and every kind of fish\\nmust be in it the little earthmen went away and summoned all their\\nkindred to help them and in two hours it was done then they returned\\nto her and said we have done as thou hast commanded the kings\\ndaughter took the handkerchief and once more struck thrice on the\\nground with it and said earthworkers go home again then they all\\nwent away\\n\\nwhen the kings son awoke the fishpond was done then the kings\\ndaughter went away also and told him that when it was six he was to\\ncome to the house when he arrived at the house the king asked hast\\nthou got the fishpond done yes said the kings son that was very\\ngood\\n\\nwhen they were again sitting at table the king said thou hast\\ncertainly done the fishpond but i cannot give thee my daughter yet\\nthou must just do one thing more what is that then asked the\\nkings son the king said he had a great mountain on which there was\\nnothing but briars which must all be cut down and at the top of it the\\nyouth must build up a great castle which must be as strong as could be\\nconceived and all the furniture and fittings belonging to a castle\\nmust be inside it and when he arose next morning the king gave him a\\nglass axe and a glass gimlet with him and he was to have all done by\\nsix oclock as he was cutting down the first briar with the axe it\\nbroke off short and so small that the pieces flew all round about and\\nhe could not use the gimlet either then he was quite miserable and\\nwaited for his dearest to see if she would not come and help him in his\\nneed when it was midday she came and brought him something to eat he\\nwent to meet her and told her all and ate something and let her comb\\nhis hair and fell asleep then she once more took the knot and struck\\nthe earth with it and said earthworkers come forth then came\\nonce again numbers of earthmen and asked what her desire was then\\nsaid she in the space of three hours they must cut down the whole of\\nthe briars and a castle must be built on the top of the mountain that\\nmust be as strong as any one could conceive and all the furniture that\\npertains to a castle must be inside it they went away and summoned\\ntheir kindred to help them and when the time was come all was ready\\nthen they came to the kings daughter and told her so and the kings\\ndaughter took her handkerchief and struck thrice on the earth with it\\nand said earthworkers go home on which they all disappeared when\\ntherefore the kings son awoke and saw everything done he was as happy\\nas a bird in air\\n\\nwhen it had struck six they went home together then said the king\\nis the castle ready yes said the kings son when they sat down\\nto table the king said i cannot give away my youngest daughter until\\nthe two eldest are married then the kings son and the kings\\ndaughter were quite troubled and the kings son had no idea what to\\ndo but he went by night to the kings daughter and ran away with her\\nwhen they had got a little distance away the kings daughter peeped\\nround and saw her father behind her oh said she what are we to\\ndo my father is behind us and will take us back with him i will at\\nonce change thee into a briar and myself into a rose and i will\\nshelter myself in the midst of the bush when the father reached the\\nplace there stood a briar with one rose on it then he was about to\\ngather the rose when the thorn came and pricked his finger so that he\\nwas forced to go home again his wife asked why he had not brought\\ntheir daughter back with him so he said he had nearly got up to her\\nbut that all at once he had lost sight of her and a briar with one\\nrose was growing on the spot\\n\\nthen said the queen if thou hadst but gathered the rose the briar\\nwould have been forced to come too so he went back again to fetch the\\nrose but in the meantime the two were already far over the plain and\\nthe king ran after them then the daughter once more looked round and\\nsaw her father coming and said oh what shall we do now i will\\ninstantly change thee into a church and myself into a priest and i\\nwill stand up in the pulpit and preach when the king got to the\\nplace there stood a church and in the pulpit was a priest preaching\\nso he listened to the sermon and then went home again\\n\\nthen the queen asked why he had not brought their daughter with him\\nand he said nay i ran a long time after her and just as i thought i\\nshould soon overtake her a church was standing there and a priest was\\nin the pulpit preaching thou shouldst just have brought the priest\\nsaid his wife and then the church would soon have come it is no use\\nto send thee i must go there myself when she had walked for some\\ntime and could see the two in the distance the kings daughter peeped\\nround and saw her mother coming and said now we are undone for my\\nmother is coming herself i will immediately change thee into a\\nfishpond and myself into a fish\\n\\nwhen the mother came to the place there was a large fishpond and in\\nthe midst of it a fish was leaping about and peeping out of the water\\nand it was quite merry she wanted to catch the fish but she could\\nnot then she was very angry and drank up the whole pond in order to\\ncatch the fish but it made her so ill that she was forced to vomit\\nand vomited the whole pond out again then she cried i see very well\\nthat nothing can be done now and said that now they might come back\\nto her then the kings daughter went back again and the queen gave\\nher daughter three walnuts and said with these thou canst help\\nthyself when thou art in thy greatest need so the young folks went\\nonce more away together and when they had walked quite ten miles they\\narrived at the castle from whence the kings son came and close by it\\nwas a village when they reached it the kings son said stay here\\nmy dearest i will just go to the castle and then will i come with a\\ncarriage and with attendants to fetch thee\\n\\nwhen he got to the castle they all rejoiced greatly at having the\\nkings son back again and he told them he had a bride who was now in\\nthe village and they must go with the carriage to fetch her then they\\nharnessed the horses at once and many attendants seated themselves\\noutside the carriage when the kings son was about to get in his\\nmother gave him a kiss and he forgot everything which had happened\\nand also what he was about to do on this his mother ordered the horses\\nto be taken out of the carriage again and everyone went back into the\\nhouse but the maiden sat in the village and watched and watched and\\nthought he would come and fetch her but no one came then the kings\\ndaughter took service in the mill which belonged to the castle and was\\nobliged to sit by the pond every afternoon and clean the tubs\\n\\nand the queen came one day on foot from the castle and went walking by\\nthe pond and saw the wellgrown maiden sitting there and said what\\na fine strong girl that is she pleases me well then she and all with\\nher looked at the maid but no one knew her so a long time passed by\\nduring which the maiden served the miller honorably and faithfully in\\nthe meantime the queen had sought a wife for her son who came from\\nquite a distant part of the world when the bride came they were at\\nonce to be married and many people hurried together all of whom\\nwanted to see everything then the girl said to the miller that he\\nmight be so good as to give her leave to go also so the miller said\\nyes do go there when she was about to go she opened one of the\\nthree walnuts and a beautiful dress lay inside it she put it on and\\nwent into the church and stood by the altar suddenly came the bride\\nand bridegroom and seated themselves before the altar and when the\\npriest was just going to bless them the bride peeped half round and\\nsaw the maiden standing there then she stood up again and said she\\nwould not be given away until she also had as beautiful a dress as that\\nlady there so they went back to the house again and sent to ask the\\nlady if she would sell that dress no she would not sell it but the\\nbride might perhaps earn it then the bride asked her how she was to do\\nthis then the maiden said if she might sleep one night outside the\\nkings sons door the bride might have what she wanted so the bride\\nsaid yes she was willing to do that but the servants were ordered\\nto give the kings son a sleepingdrink and then the maiden laid\\nherself down on the threshold and lamented all night long she had had\\nthe forest cut down for him she had had the fishpond cleaned out for\\nhim she had had the castle built for him she had changed him into a\\nbriar and then into a church and at last into a fishpond and yet he\\nhad forgotten her so quickly the kings son did not hear one word of\\nit but the servants had been awakened and had listened to it and had\\nnot known what it could mean the next morning when they were all up\\nthe bride put on the dress and went away to the church with the\\nbridegroom in the meantime the maiden opened the second walnut and a\\nstill more beautiful dress was inside it she put it on and went and\\nstood by the altar in the church and everything happened as it had\\nhappened the time before and the maiden again lay all night on the\\nthreshold which led to the chamber of the kings son and the servant\\nwas once more to give him a sleepingdrink the servant however went\\nto him and gave him something to keep him awake and then the kings\\nson went to bed and the millers maiden bemoaned herself as before on\\nthe threshold of the door and told of all that she had done all this\\nthe kings son heard and was sore troubled and what was past came\\nback to him then he wanted to go to her but his mother had locked the\\ndoor the next morning however he went at once to his beloved and\\ntold her everything which had happened to him and prayed her not to be\\nangry with him for having forgotten her then the kings daughter\\nopened the third walnut and within it was a still more magnificent\\ndress which she put on and went with her bridegroom to church and\\nnumbers of children came who gave them flowers and offered them gay\\nribbons to bind about their feet and they were blessed by the priest\\nand had a merry wedding but the false mother and the bride had to\\ndepart and the mouth of the person who last told all this is still\\nwarm',\n",

are the\\ntwo different colors when the princess heard that she turned pale\\nand nearly fell down with terror for the little tailor had guessed her\\nriddle and she had firmly believed that no man on

this shall be my last pleasure\\nthought he pulled it out lit it at the blue light and began to smoke\\nwhen the smoke had circled about the cavern suddenly a little black\\ndwarf stood before him and said lord what are thy commands what\\ncommands have i to give thee replied the soldier quite astonished\\ni must do everything thou biddest me said the little man good\\nsaid the soldier then in the first place help me out of this well\\nthe little man took him by the hand and led him through an underground\\npassage but he did not forget to take the blue light with him on the\\nway the dwarf showed him the treasures which the witch had collected\\nand hidden there and the soldier took as much gold as he could carry\\nwhen he was above he said to the little man now go and bind the old\\nwitch and carry her before the judge in a short time she with\\nfrightful cries came riding by as swift as the wind on a wild\\ntomcat nor was it long after that before the little man reappeared\\nit is all done said he and the witch is already hanging on the\\ngallows what further commands has my lord inquired the dwarf at\\nthis moment none answered the soldier thou canst return home only\\nbe at hand immediately if i summon thee nothing more is needed than\\nthat thou shouldst light thy pipe at the blue light and i will appear\\nbefore thee at once thereupon he vanished from his sight\\n\\nthe soldier returned to the town from which he had come he went to the\\nbest inn ordered himself handsome clothes and then bade the landlord\\nfurnish him a room as handsomely as possible when it was ready and the\\nsoldier had taken possession of it he summoned the little black\\nmannikin and said i have served the king faithfully but he has\\ndismissed me and left me to hunger and now i want to take my\\nrevenge what am i to do asked the little man late at night when\\nthe kings daughter is in bed bring her here in her sleep she shall\\ndo servants work for me the mannikin said that is an easy thing\\nfor me to do but a very dangerous thing for you for if it is\\ndiscovered you will fare ill when twelve oclock had struck the\\ndoor sprang open and the mannikin carried in the princess aha art\\nthou there cried the soldier get to thy work at once fetch the\\nbroom and sweep the chamber when she had done this he ordered her to\\ncome to his chair and then he stretched out his feet and said pull\\noff my boots for me and then he threw them in her face and made her\\npick them up again and clean and brighten them she however did\\neverything he bade her without opposition silently and with halfshut\\neyes when the first cock crowed the mannikin carried her back to the\\nroyal palace and laid her in her bed\\n\\nnext morning when the princess arose she went to her father and told\\nhim that she had had a very strange dream i was carried through the\\nstreets with the rapidity of lightning said she and taken into a\\nsoldiers room and i had to wait upon him like a servant sweep his\\nroom clean his boots and do all kinds of menial work it was only a\\ndream and yet i am just as tired as if i really had done everything\\nthe dream may have been true said the king i will give thee a\\npiece of advice fill thy pocket full of peas and make a small hole in\\nit and then if thou art carried away again they will fall out and\\nleave a track in the streets but unseen by the king the mannikin was\\nstanding beside him when he said that and heard all at night when the\\nsleeping princess was again carried through the streets some peas\\ncertainly did fall out of her pocket but they made no track for the\\ncrafty mannikin had just before scattered peas in every street there\\nwas and again the princess was compelled to do servants work until\\ncockcrow\\n\\nnext morning the king sent his people out to seek the track but it was\\nall in vain for in every street poor children were sitting picking up\\npeas and saying it must have rained peas last night we must\\nthink of something else said the king keep thy shoes on when thou\\ngoest to bed and before thou comest back from the place where thou art\\ntaken hide one of them there i will soon contrive to find it the\\nblack mannikin heard this plot and at night when the soldier again\\nordered him to bring the princess revealed it to him and told him\\nthat he knew of no expedient to counteract this stratagem and that if\\nthe shoe were found in the soldiers house it would go badly with him\\ndo what i bid thee replied the soldier and again this third night\\nthe princess was obliged to work like a servant but before she went\\naway she hid her shoe under the bed\\n\\nnext morning the king had the entire town searched for his daughters\\nshoe it was found at the soldiers and the soldier himself who at\\nthe entreaty of the dwarf had gone outside the gate was soon brought\\nback and thrown into prison in his flight he had forgotten the most\\nvaluable things he had the blue light and the gold and had only one\\nducat in his pocket and now loaded with chains he was standing at the\\nwindow of his dungeon when he chanced to see one of his comrades\\npassing by the soldier tapped at the pane of glass and when this man\\ncame up said to him be so kind as to fetch me the small bundle i\\nhave left lying in the inn and i will give you a ducat for doing it\\nhis comrade ran thither and brought him what he wanted as soon as the\\nsoldier was alone again he lighted his pipe and summoned the black\\nmannikin have no fear said the latter to his master go\\nwheresoever they take you and let them do what they will only take\\nthe blue light with you next day the soldier was tried and though he\\nhad done nothing wicked the judge condemned him to death when he was\\nled forth to die he begged a last favor of the king what is it\\nasked the king that i may smoke one more pipe on my way thou mayst\\nsmoke three answered the king but do not imagine that i will spare\\nthy life then the soldier pulled out his pipe and lighted it at the\\nblue light and as soon as a few wreaths of smoke had ascended the\\nmannikin was there with a small cudgel in his hand and said what\\ndoes my lord command strike down to earth that false judge there\\nand his constable and spare not the king who has treated me so ill\\nthen the mannikin fell on them like lightning darting this way and\\nthat way and whosoever was so much as touched by his cudgel fell to\\nearth and did not venture to stir again the king was terrified he\\nthrew himself on the soldiers mercy and merely to be allowed to live\\nat all gave him his kingdom for his own and the princess to wife',\n",

it came to pass that\\nhe got to the house of a giant and as he was so tired he sat down by\\nthe door and rested and as he let his eyes roam here and there he saw\\nthe giants playthings lying in the yard these were a couple of\\nenormous balls and ninepins as tall as a man after a while he had a\\nfancy to set the ninepins up and then rolled the balls at them and\\nscreamed and cried out when the ninepins fell and had a merry time of\\nit the giant heard the noise stretched his head out of the window\\nand saw a man who was not taller than other men and yet played with\\nhis ninepins little worm cried he why art thou playing with my\\nballs who gave thee strength to do it the kings son looked up saw\\nthe giant and said oh thou blockhead thou thinkest indeed that\\nthou only hast strong arms i can do everything i want to do the\\ngiant came down and watched the bowling with great admiration and\\nsaid child of man if thou art one of that kind go and bring me an\\napple of the tree of

cannot find the tree i will soon find it said\\nthe kings son and i do not know what is to prevent me from getting\\nthe apple down the giant said thou really believest it to be so\\neasy the garden in which the tree stands is surrounded by an iron\\nrailing and in front of the railing lie wild beasts each close to the\\nother and they keep watch and let no man go in they will be sure to\\nlet me in said the kings son yes but even if thou dost get into\\nthe garden and seest the apple hanging to the tree it is still not\\nthine a ring hangs in front of it through which any one who wants to\\nreach the apple and break it off must put his hand and no one has yet\\nhad the luck to do it that luck will be mine said the kings son\\n\\nthen he took leave of the giant and went forth over mountain and\\nvalley and through plains and forests until at length he came to the\\nwondrous garden\\n\\nthe beasts lay round about it but they had put their heads down and\\nwere asleep moreover they did not awake when he went up to them so\\nhe stepped over them climbed the fence and got safely into the\\ngarden there in the very middle of it stood the tree of life and\\nthe red apples were shining upon the branches he climbed up the trunk\\nto the top and as he was about to reach out for an apple he saw a\\nring hanging before it but he thrust his hand through that without any\\ndifficulty and gathered the apple the ring closed tightly on his arm\\nand all at once he felt a prodigious strength flowing through his\\nveins when he had come down again from the tree with the apple he\\nwould not climb over the fence but grasped the great gate and had no\\nneed to shake it more than once before it sprang open with a loud\\ncrash then he went out and the lion which had been lying down before\\nwas awake and sprang after him not in rage and fierceness but\\nfollowing him humbly as its master\\n\\nthe kings son took the giant the apple he had promised him and said\\nseest thou i have brought it without difficulty the giant was glad\\nthat his desire had been so soon satisfied hastened to his bride and\\ngave her the apple for which she had wished she was a beautiful and\\nwise maiden and as she did not see the ring on his arm she said i\\nshall never believe that thou hast brought the apple until i see the\\nring on thine arm the giant said i have nothing to do but go home\\nand fetch it and thought it would be easy to take away by force from\\nthe weak man what he would not give of his own free will he therefore\\ndemanded the ring from him but the kings son refused it where the\\napple is the ring must be also said the giant if thou wilt not\\ngive it of thine own accord thou must fight with me for it\\n\\nthey wrestled with each other for a long time but the giant could not\\nget the better of the kings son who was strengthened by the magical\\npower of the ring then the giant thought of a stratagem and said i\\nhave got warm with fighting and so hast thou we will bathe in the\\nriver and cool ourselves before we begin again the kings son who\\nknew nothing of falsehood went with him to the water and pulled off\\nwith his clothes the ring also from his arm and sprang into the river\\nthe giant instantly snatched the ring and ran away with it but the\\nlion which had observed the theft pursued the giant tore the ring\\nout of his hand and brought it back to its master then the giant\\nplaced himself behind an oaktree and while the kings son was busy\\nputting on his clothes again surprised him and put both his eyes out\\n\\nand now the unhappy kings son stood there and was blind and knew not\\nhow to help himself then the giant came back to him took him by the\\nhand as if he were someone who wanted to guide him and led him to the\\ntop of a high rock there he left him standing and thought just two\\nsteps more and he will fall down and kill himself and i can take the\\nring from him but the faithful lion had not deserted its master it\\nheld him fast by the clothes and drew him gradually back again when\\nthe giant came and wanted to rob the dead man he saw that his cunning\\nhad been in vain is there no way then of destroying a weak child of\\nman like that said he angrily to himself and seized the kings son\\nand led him back again to the precipice by another way but the lion\\nwhich saw his evil design helped its master out of danger here also\\nwhen they had got close to the edge the giant let the blind mans hand\\ndrop and was going to leave him behind alone but the lion pushed the\\ngiant so that he was thrown down and fell dashed to pieces on the\\nground\\n\\nthe faithful animal again drew its master back from the precipice and\\nguided him to a tree by which flowed a clear brook the kings son sat\\ndown there but the lion lay down and sprinkled the water in his face\\nwith its paws scarcely had a couple of drops wetted the sockets of his\\neyes than he was once more able to see something and remarked a\\nlittle bird flying quite close by which wounded itself against the\\ntrunk of a tree on this it went down to the water and bathed itself\\ntherein and then it soared upwards and swept between the trees without\\ntouching them as if it had recovered its sight again then the kings\\nson recognized a sign from god and stooped down to the water and\\nwashed and bathed his face in it and when he arose he had his eyes\\nonce more brighter and clearer than they had ever been\\n\\nthe kings son thanked god for his great mercy and travelled with his\\nlion onwards through the world and it came to pass that he arrived\\nbefore a castle which was enchanted in the gateway stood a maiden of\\nbeautiful form and fine face but she was quite black she spoke to him\\nand said ah if thou couldst but deliver me from the evil spell which\\nis thrown over me what shall i do said the kings son the maiden\\nanswered thou must pass three nights in the great hall of this\\nenchanted castle but thou must let no fear enter thy heart when they\\nare doing their worst to torment thee if thou bearest it without\\nletting a sound escape thee i shall be free thy life they dare not\\ntake then said the kings son i have no fear with gods help i\\nwill try it so he went gaily into the castle and when it grew dark\\nhe seated himself in the large hall and waited everything was quiet\\nhowever till midnight when all at once a great tumult began and out\\nof every hole and corner came little devils they behaved as if they\\ndid not see him seated themselves in the middle of the room lighted a\\nfire and began to gamble when one of them lost he said it is not\\nright some one is here who does not belong to us it is his fault that\\ni am losing wait you fellow behind the stove i am coming said\\nanother the screaming became still louder so that no one could have\\nheard it without terror the kings son stayed sitting quite quietly\\nand was not afraid but at last the devils jumped up from the ground\\nand fell on him and there were so many of them that he could not\\ndefend himself from them they dragged him about on the floor pinched\\nhim pricked him beat him and tormented him but no sound escaped\\nfrom him towards morning they disappeared and he was so exhausted\\nthat he could scarcely move his

strength flow through his veins she said thou\\nhast held out successfully for one night but two more lie before\\nthee then she went away again and as she was going he observed that\\nher feet had become white the next night the devils came and began\\ntheir gambols anew they fell on the kings son and beat him much more\\nseverely than the night before until his body was covered with wounds\\nbut as he bore all quietly they were forced to leave him and when\\ndawn appeared the maiden came and healed him with the water of life\\nand when she went away he saw with joy that she had already become\\nwhite to the tips of her fingers and now he had only one night more to\\ngo through but it was the worst the hobgoblins came again art thou\\nthere still cried they thou shalt be tormented till thy breath\\nstops they pricked him and beat him and threw him here and there\\nand pulled him by the arms and legs as if they wanted to tear him to\\npieces but he bore everything and never uttered a cry at last the\\ndevils vanished but he lay fainting there and did not stir nor could\\nhe raise his eyes to look at the maiden who came in and sprinkled and\\nbathed him with the water of life but suddenly he was freed from all\\npain and felt fresh and healthy as if he had awakened from sleep and\\nwhen he opened his eyes he saw the maiden standing by him snowwhite\\nand fair as day rise said she and swing thy sword three times\\nover the stairs and then all will be delivered and when he had done\\nthat the whole castle was released from enchantment and the maiden\\nwas a rich kings daughter the servants came and said that the table\\nwas already set in the great hall and dinner served up then they sat\\ndown and ate and drank together and in the evening the wedding

       " 'there was once a young huntsman who went into the forest to lie in\\nwait he had a fresh and joyous heart and as he was going thither\\nwhistling upon a leaf an ugly old crone came up who spoke to him and\\nsaid goodday dear huntsman truly you are merry and contented but\\ni am suffering from hunger and thirst do give me an alms the\\nhuntsman had compassion on the poor old creature felt in his pocket\\nand gave her what he could afford he was then about to go further but\\nthe old woman stopped him and said listen dear huntsman to what i\\ntell you i will make you a present in return for your kindness go on\\nyour way now but in a little while you will come to a tree whereon\\nnine birds are sitting which have a cloak in their claws and are\\nplucking at it take your gun and shoot into the midst of them they\\nwill let the cloak fall down to you but one of the birds will be hurt\\nand will drop down dead carry away the cloak it is a wishingcloak\\nwhen you throw it over your shoulders you only have to wish to be in a\\ncertain place and you will be there in the twinkling of an eye take\\nout the heart of the dead bird and swallow it whole and every morning\\nearly when you get up you will find a gold piece under your pillow\\nthe huntsman thanked the wise woman and thought to himself those are\\nfine things that she has promised me if all does but come true and\\nverily when he had walked about a hundred paces he heard in the\\nbranches above him such a screaming and twittering that he looked up\\nand saw there a crowd of birds who were tearing a piece of cloth about\\nwith their beaks and claws and tugging and fighting as if each wanted\\nto have it all to himself well said the huntsman this is\\nwonderful it has really come to pass just as the old wife foretold\\nand he took the gun from his shoulder aimed and fired right into the\\nmidst of them so that the feathers flew about the birds instantly\\ntook to flight with loud outcries but one dropped down dead and the\\ncloak fell at the same time then the huntsman did as the old woman had\\ndirected him cut open the bird sought the heart swallowed it down\\nand took the cloak home with him\\n\\nnext morning when he awoke the promise occurred to him and he wished\\nto see if it also had been fulfilled when he lifted up the pillow the\\ngold piece shone in his eyes and next day he found another and so it\\nwent on every time he got up he gathered together a heap of gold but\\nat last he thought of what use is all my gold to me if i stay at\\nhome i will go forth and see the world\\n\\nhe then took leave of his parents buckled on his huntsmans pouch and\\ngun and went out into the world it came to pass that one day he\\ntravelled through a dense forest and when he came to the end of it in\\nthe plain before him stood a fine castle an old woman was standing\\nwith a wonderfully beautiful maiden looking out of one of the windows\\nthe old woman however was a witch and said to the maiden there\\ncomes one out of the forest who has a wonderful treasure in his body\\nwe must filch it from him my dear daughter it is more suitable for us\\nthan for him he has a birds heart about him by means of which a gold\\npiece lies every morning under his pillow she told her what she was\\nto do to get it and what part she had to play and finally threatened\\nher and said with angry eyes and if you do not attend to what i say\\nit will be the worse for you now when the huntsman came nearer he\\ndescried the maiden and said to himself i have travelled about for\\nsuch a long time i will take a rest for once and enter that beautiful\\ncastle i have certainly money enough nevertheless the real reason\\nwas that he had caught sight of the pretty girl\\n\\nhe entered the house and was well received and courteously\\nentertained before long he was so much in love with the young witch\\nthat he no longer thought of anything else and only saw things as she\\nsaw them and did what she desired the old woman then said now we\\nmust have the birds heart he will never miss it she prepared a\\ndrink and when it was ready poured it into a cup and gave it to the\\nmaiden who was to present it to the huntsman she did so saying\\nnow my dearest drink to me so he took the cup and when he had\\nswallowed the draught he brought up the heart of the bird the girl\\nhad to take it away secretly and swallow it herself for the old woman\\nwould have it so thenceforward he found no more gold under his pillow\\nbut it lay instead under that of the maiden from whence the old woman\\nfetched it away every morning but he was so much in love and so\\nbefooled that he thought of nothing else but of passing his time with\\nthe girl\\n\\nthen the old witch said we have the birds heart but we must also\\ntake the wishingcloak away from him the girl answered we will\\nleave him that he has lost his wealth the old woman was angry and\\nsaid such a mantle is a wonderful thing and is seldom to be found in\\nthis world i must and will have it she gave the girl several blows\\nand said that if she did not obey it should fare ill with her so she\\ndid the old womans bidding placed herself at the window and looked on\\nthe distant country as if she were very sorrowful the huntsman asked\\nwhy dost thou stand there so sorrowfully ah my beloved was her\\nanswer over yonder lies the garnet mountain where the precious\\nstones grow i long for them so much that when i think of them i feel\\nquite sad but who can get them only the birds they fly and can reach\\nthem but a man never hast thou nothing else to complain of said\\nthe huntsman i will soon remove that burden from thy heart with\\nthat he drew her under his mantle wished himself on the garnet\\nmountain and in the twinkling of an eye they were sitting on it\\ntogether precious stones were glistening on every side so that it was\\na joy to see them and together they gathered the finest and costliest\\nof them now the old woman had through her sorceries contrived that\\nthe eyes of the huntsman should become heavy he said to the maiden\\nwe will sit down and rest awhile i am so tired that i can no longer\\nstand on my feet then they sat down and he laid his head in her lap\\nand fell asleep when he was asleep she unfastened the mantle from his\\nshoulders and wrapped herself in it picked up the garnets and stones\\nand wished herself back at home with them\\n\\nbut when the huntsman had had his sleep out and awoke and perceived\\nthat his sweetheart had betrayed him and left him alone on the wild\\nmountain he said oh what treachery there is in the world and sat\\ndown there in care and sorrow not knowing what to do but the mountain\\nbelonged to some wild and monstrous giants who dwelt thereon and lived\\ntheir lives there and he had not sat long before he saw three of them\\ncoming towards him so he lay down as if he were sunk in a deep sleep\\nthen the giants came up and the first kicked him with his foot and\\nsaid what sort of an earthworm is lying curled up here the second\\nsaid step upon him and kill him but the third said that would\\nindeed be worth your while just let him live he cannot remain here\\nand when he climbs higher toward the summit of of the mountain the\\nclouds will lay hold of him and bear him away so saying they passed\\nby but the huntsman had paid heed to their words and as soon as they\\nwere gone he rose and climbed up to the summit of the mountain and\\nwhen he had sat there a while a cloud floated towards him caught him\\nup carried him away and travelled about for a long time in the\\nheavens then it sank lower and let itself down on a great\\ncabbagegarden girt round by walls so that he came softly to the\\nground on cabbages and vegetables\\n\\nthen the huntsman looked about him and said if i had but something to\\neat i am so hungry and my hunger will increase in course of time but\\ni see here neither apples nor pears nor any other sort of fruit\\neverywhere nothing but cabbages but at length he thought at a pinch\\ni can eat some of the leaves they do not taste particularly good but\\nthey will refresh me with that he picked himself out a fine head of\\ncabbage and ate it but scarcely had he swallowed a couple of\\nmouthfuls than he felt very strange and quite different\\n\\nfour legs grew on him a large head and two thick ears and he saw with\\nhorror that he was changed into an ass still as his hunger increased\\nevery minute and as the juicy leaves were suitable to his present\\nnature he went on eating with great zest at last he arrived at a\\ndifferent kind of cabbage but as soon as he had swallowed it he again\\nfelt a change and reassumed his former human shape\\n\\nthen the huntsman lay down and slept off his fatigue when he awoke\\nnext morning he broke off one head of the bad cabbages and another of\\nthe good ones and thought to himself this shall help me to get my\\nown again and punish treachery then he took the cabbages with him\\nclimbed over the wall and went forth to seek for the castle of his\\nsweetheart after wandering about for a couple of days he was lucky\\nenough to find it again he dyed his face brown so that his own mother\\nwould not have known him and begged for shelter i am so tired said\\nhe that i can go no further the witch asked who are you\\ncountryman and what is your business i am a kings messenger and\\nwas sent out to seek the most delicious salad which grows beneath the\\nsun i have even been so fortunate as to find it and am carrying it\\nabout with me but the heat of the sun is so intense that the delicate\\ncabbage threatens to wither and i do not know if i can carry it any\\nfurther\\n\\nwhen the old woman heard of the exquisite salad she was greedy and\\nsaid dear countryman let me just taste this wonderful salad why\\nnot answered he i have brought two heads with me and will give you\\none of them and he opened his pouch and handed her the bad cabbage\\nthe witch suspected nothing amiss and her mouth watered so for this\\nnew dish that she herself went into the kitchen and dressed it when it\\nwas prepared she could not wait until it was set on the table but took\\na couple of leaves at once and put them in her mouth but hardly had\\nshe swallowed them than she was deprived of her human shape and she\\nran out into the courtyard in the form of an ass presently the\\nmaidservant entered the kitchen saw the salad standing there ready\\nprepared and was about to carry it up but on the way according to\\nhabit she was seized by the desire to taste and she ate a couple of\\nleaves instantly the magic power showed itself and she likewise\\nbecame an ass and ran out to the old woman and the dish of salad fell\\nto the ground meantime the messenger sat beside the beautiful girl\\nand as no one came with the salad and she also was longing for it she\\nsaid i dont know what has become of the salad the huntsman\\nthought the salad must have already taken effect and said i will\\ngo to the kitchen and inquire about it as he went down he saw the two\\nasses running about in the courtyard the salad however was lying on\\nthe ground all right said he the two have taken their portion\\nand he picked up the other leaves laid them on the dish and carried\\nthem to the maiden i bring you the delicate food myself said he\\nin order that you may not have to wait longer then she ate of it\\nand was like the others immediately deprived of her human form and\\nran out into the courtyard in the shape of an ass\\n\\nafter the huntsman had washed his face so that the transformed ones\\ncould recognize him he went down into the courtyard and said now\\nyou shall receive the wages of your treachery and bound them\\ntogether all three with one rope and drove them along until he came\\nto a mill he knocked at the window the miller put out his head and\\nasked what he wanted i have three unmanageable beasts answered he\\nwhich i dont want to keep any longer will you take them in and give\\nthem food and stable room and manage them as i tell you and then i\\nwill pay you what you ask the miller said why not but how am i to\\nmanage them the huntsman then said that he was to give three beatings\\nand one meal daily to the old donkey and that was the witch one\\nbeating and three meals to the younger one which was the servantgirl\\nand to the youngest which was the maiden no beatings and three meals\\nfor he could not bring himself to have the maiden beaten after that he\\nwent back into the castle and found therein everything he needed\\n\\nafter a couple of days the miller came and said he must inform him\\nthat the old ass which had received three beatings and only one meal\\ndaily was dead the two others he continued are certainly not\\ndead and are fed three times daily but they are so sad that they\\ncannot last much longer the huntsman was moved to pity put away his\\nanger and told the miller to drive them back again to him and when\\nthey came he gave them some of the good salad so that they became\\nhuman again the beautiful girl fell on her knees before him and said\\nah my beloved forgive me for the evil i have done you my mother\\ndrove me to it it was done against my will for i love you dearly\\nyour wishingcloak hangs in a cupboard and as for the birdsheart i\\nwill take a vomiting potion but he thought otherwise and said keep\\nit it is all the same for i will take thee for my true wife so the\\nwedding was celebrated and they lived happily together until their\\ndeath',\n",

of an excellent servant for him he was well\\npleased with that and had ferdinand the faithful brought to him and\\nwanted to make him his servant he however liked better to be an\\noutrider for where his horse was there he also wanted to be so the\\nking made him an outrider when ferdinand the unfaithful learnt that\\nhe said to the girl what dost thou help him and not me oh said\\nthe girl i will help thee too she thought i must keep friends\\nwith that man for he is not to be trusted she went to the king and\\noffered him as a servant and the king was willing\\n\\nnow when the king met his lords in the morning he always lamented and\\nsaid oh if i had but my love with me ferdinand the unfaithful was\\nhowever always hostile to ferdinand the faithful so once when the\\nking was complaining thus he said you have the outrider send him\\naway to get her and if he does not do it his head must be struck\\noff then the king sent for ferdinand the faithful and told him that\\nthere was in this place or in that place a girl he loved and that he\\nwas to bring her to him and if he did not do it he should die\\n\\nferdinand the faithful went into the stable to his white horse and\\ncomplained and lamented oh what an unhappy man i am then someone\\nbehind him cried ferdinand the faithful why weepest thou he looked\\nround but saw no one and went on lamenting oh my dear little white\\nhorse now must i leave thee now must i die then some one cried once\\nmore ferdinand the faithful why weepest thou then for the first\\ntime he was aware that it was his little white horse who was putting\\nthat question dost thou speak my little white horse canst thou do\\nthat and again he said i am to go to this place and to that and\\nam to bring the bride canst thou tell me how i am to set about it\\nthen answered the little white horse go thou to the king and say if\\nhe will give thou what thou must have thou wilt get her for him if he\\nwill give thee a ship full of meat and a ship full of bread it will\\nsucceed great giants dwell on the lake and if thou takest no meat\\nwith thee for them they will tear thee to pieces and there are the\\nlarge birds which would pick the eyes out of thy head if thou hadst no\\nbread for them then the king made all the butchers in the land kill\\nand all the bakers bake that the ships might be filled when they were\\nfull the little white horse said to ferdinand the faithful now mount\\nme and go with me into the ship and then when the giants come say\\n\\npeace peace my dear little giants\\ni have had thought of ye\\nsomething i have brought for ye\\n\\n\\nand when the birds come thou shalt again say\\n\\npeace peace my dear little birds\\ni have had thought of ye\\nsomething i have brought for ye\\n\\n\\nthen they will do nothing to thee and when thou comest to the castle\\nthe giants will help thee then go up to the castle and take a couple\\nof giants with thee there the princess lies sleeping thou must\\nhowever not awaken her but the giants must lift her up and carry her\\nin her bed to the ship and now everything took place as the little\\nwhite horse had said and ferdinand the faithful gave the giants and\\nthe birds what he had brought with him for them and that made the\\ngiants willing and they carried the princess in her bed to the king\\nand when she came to the king she said she could not live she must\\nhave her writings they had been left in her castle then by the\\ninstigation of ferdinand the unfaithful ferdinand the faithful was\\ncalled and the king told him he must fetch the writings from the\\ncastle or he should die then he went once more into the stable and\\nbemoaned himself and said oh my dear little white horse now i am to\\ngo away again how am i to do it then the little white horse said he\\nwas just to load the ships full again so it happened again as it had\\nhappened before and the giants and the birds were satisfied and made\\ngentle by the meat when they came to the castle the white horse told\\nferdinand the faithful that he must go in and that on the table in the\\nprincesss bedroom lay the writings and ferdinand the faithful went\\nin and fetched them when they were on the lake he let his pen fall\\ninto the water then said the white horse now i cannot help thee at\\nall but he remembered his flute and began to play on it and the\\nfish came with the pen in its mouth and gave it to him so he took the\\nwritings to the castle where the wedding was celebrated\\n\\nthe queen however did not love the king because he had no nose but\\nshe would have much liked to love ferdinand the faithful once\\ntherefore when all the lords of the court were together the queen\\nsaid she could do feats of magic that she could cut off any ones head\\nand put it on again and that one of them ought just to try it but\\nnone of them would be the first so ferdinand the faithful again at\\nthe instigation of ferdinand the unfaithful undertook it and she hewed\\noff his head and put it on again for him and it healed together\\ndirectly so that it looked as if he had a red thread round his throat\\nthen the king said to her my child and where hast thou learnt that\\nyes she said i understand the art shall i just try it on thee\\nalso oh yes said he but she cut off his head and did not put it\\non again but pretended that she could not get it on and that it would\\nnot keep fixed then the king was buried but she married ferdinand the\\nfaithful\\n\\nhe however always rode on his white horse and once when he was\\nseated on it it told him that he was to go on to the heath which he\\nknew and gallop three times round it and when he had done that the\\nwhite horse stood up on its hind legs and was changed into a kings\\nson',\n",
       " 'in the days when wishing was still of some use a kings son was\\nbewitched by an old witch and shut up in an iron stove in a forest\\nthere he passed many years and no one could deliver him then a kings\\ndaughter came into the forest who had lost herself and could not find\\nher fathers kingdom again after she had wandered about for nine days\\nshe at length came to the iron stove then a voice came forth from it\\nand asked her whence comest thou and whither goest thou she\\nanswered i have lost my fathers kingdom and cannot get home again\\nthen a voice inside the iron stove said i will help thee to get home\\nagain and that indeed most swiftly if thou wilt promise to do what i\\ndesire of thee i am the son of a far greater king than thy father and\\ni will marry thee\\n\\nthen was she afraid and thought good heavens what can i do with an\\niron stove but as she much wished to get home to her father she\\npromised to do as he desired but he said thou shalt return here and\\nbring a knife with thee and scrape a hole in the iron then he gave\\nher a companion who walked near her but did not speak but in two\\nhours he took her home there was great joy in the castle when the\\nkings daughter came home and the old king fell on her neck and kissed\\nher she however was sorely troubled and said dear father what i\\nhave suffered i should never have got home again from the great wild\\nforest if i had not come to an iron stove but i have been forced to\\ngive my word that i will go back to it set it free and marry it\\nthen the old king was so terrified that he all but fainted for he had\\nbut this one daughter they therefore resolved they would send in her\\nplace the millers daughter who was very beautiful they took her\\nthere gave her a knife and said she was to scrape at the iron stove\\nso she scraped at it for fourandtwenty hours but could not bring off\\nthe least morsel of it when day dawned a voice in the stove said it\\nseems to me it is day outside then she answered it seems so to me\\ntoo i fancy i hear the noise of my fathers mill\\n\\nso thou art a millers daughter then go thy way at once and let the\\nkings daughter come here then she went away at once and told the\\nold king that the man outside there would have none of her he wanted\\nthe kings daughter they however still had a swineherds daughter\\nwho was even prettier than the millers daughter and they determined\\nto give her a piece of gold to go to the iron stove instead of the\\nkings daughter so she was taken thither and she also had to scrape\\nfor fourandtwenty hours she however made nothing of it when day\\nbroke a voice inside the stove cried it seems to me it is day\\noutside then answered she so it seems to me also i fancy i hear my\\nfathers horn blowing\\n\\nthen thou art a swineherds daughter go away at once and tell the\\nkings daughter to come and tell her all must be done as promised and\\nif she does not come everything in the kingdom shall be ruined and\\ndestroyed and not one stone be left standing on another when the\\nkings daughter heard that she began to weep but now there was nothing\\nfor it but to keep her promise so she took leave of her father put a\\nknife in her pocket and went forth to the iron stove in the forest\\nwhen she got there she began to scrape and the iron gave way and\\nwhen two hours were over she had already scraped a small hole then\\nshe peeped in and saw a youth so handsome and so brilliant with gold\\nand with precious jewels that her very soul was delighted now\\ntherefore she went on scraping and made the hole so large that he was\\nable to get out then said he thou art mine and i am thine thou art\\nmy bride and hast released me he wanted to take her away with him to\\nhis kingdom but she entreated him to let her go once again to her\\nfather and the kings son allowed her to do so but she was not to say\\nmore to her father than three words and then she was to come back\\nagain so she went home but she spoke more than three words and\\ninstantly the iron stove disappeared and was taken far away over glass\\nmountains and piercing swords but the kings son was set free and no\\nlonger shut up in it after this she bade goodbye to her father took\\nsome money with her but not much and went back to the great forest\\nand looked for the iron stove but it was nowhere to be found for nine\\ndays she sought it and then her hunger grew so great that she did not\\nknow what to do for she could no longer live when it was evening she\\nseated herself in a small tree and made up her mind to spend the night\\nthere as she was afraid of wild beasts when midnight drew near she\\nsaw in the distance a small light and thought ah there i should be\\nsaved she got down from the tree and went towards the light but on\\nthe way she prayed then she came to a little old house and much grass\\nhad grown all about it and a small heap of wood lay in front of it\\nshe thought ah whither have i come and peeped in through the\\nwindow but she saw nothing inside but toads big and little except a\\ntable well covered with wine and roast meat and the plates and glasses\\nwere of silver then she took courage and knocked at the door the fat\\ntoad cried\\n\\nlittle green waitingmaid\\nwaitingmaid with the limping leg\\nlittle dog of the limping leg\\nhop hither and thither\\nand quickly see who is without\\n\\n\\nand a small toad came walking by and opened the door to her when she\\nentered they all bade her welcome and she was forced to sit down\\nthey asked where hast thou come from and whither art thou going\\nthen she related all that had befallen her and how because she had\\ntransgressed the order which had been given her not to say more than\\nthree words the stove and the kings son also had disappeared and\\nnow she was about to seek him over hill and dale until she found him\\nthen the old fat one said\\n\\nlittle green waitingmaid\\nwaitingmaid with the limping leg\\nlittle dog of the limping leg\\nhop hither and thither\\nand bring me the great box\\n\\n\\nthen the little one went and brought the box after this they gave her\\nmeat and drink and took her to a wellmade bed which felt like silk\\nand velvet and she laid herself therein in gods name and slept\\nwhen morning came she arose and the old toad gave her three needles\\nout of the great box which she was to take with her they would be\\nneeded by her for she had to cross a high glass mountain and go over\\nthree piercing swords and a great lake if she did all this she would\\nget her lover back again then she gave her three things which she was\\nto take the greatest care of namely three large needles a\\nploughwheel and three nuts with these she travelled onwards and\\nwhen she came to the glass mountain which was so slippery she stuck\\nthe three needles first behind her feet and then before them and so\\ngot over it and when she was over it she hid them in a place which\\nshe marked carefully after this she came to the three piercing swords\\nand then she seated herself on her ploughwheel and rolled over them\\nat last she arrived in front of a great lake and when she had crossed\\nit she came to a large and beautiful castle she went and asked for a\\nplace she was a poor girl she said and would like to be hired she\\nknew however that the kings son whom she had released from the iron\\nstove in the great forest was in the castle then she was taken as a\\nscullerymaid at low wages but already the kings son had another\\nmaiden by his side whom he wanted to marry for he thought that she had\\nlong been dead\\n\\nin the evening when she had washed up and was done she felt in her\\npocket and found the three nuts which the old toad had given her she\\ncracked one with her teeth and was going to eat the kernel when lo and\\nbehold there was a stately royal garment in it but when the bride\\nheard of this she came and asked for the dress and wanted to buy it\\nand said it is not a dress for a servantgirl but she said no she\\nwould not sell it but if the bride would grant her one thing she\\nshould have it and that was leave to sleep one night in her\\nbridegrooms chamber the bride gave her permission because the dress\\nwas so pretty and she had never had one like it when it was evening\\nshe said to her bridegroom that silly girl will sleep in thy room\\nif thou art willing so am i said he she however gave him a glass\\nof wine in which she had poured a sleepingdraught so the bridegroom\\nand the scullerymaid went to sleep in the room and he slept so\\nsoundly that she could not waken him\\n\\nshe wept the whole night and cried i set thee free when thou wert in\\nan iron stove in the wild forest i sought thee and walked over a\\nglass mountain and three sharp swords and a great lake before i found\\nthee and yet thou wilt not hear me\\n\\nthe servants sat by the chamberdoor and heard how she thus wept the\\nwhole night through and in the morning they told it to their lord and\\nthe next evening when she had washed up she opened the second nut and\\na far more beautiful dress was within it and when the bride beheld it\\nshe wished to buy that also but the girl would not take money and\\nbegged that she might once again sleep in the bridegrooms chamber the\\nbride however gave him a sleepingdrink and he slept so soundly that\\nhe could hear nothing but the scullerymaid wept the whole night long\\nand cried i set thee free when thou wert in an iron stove in the wild\\nforest i sought thee and walked over a glass mountain and over three\\nsharp swords and a great lake before i found thee and yet thou wilt\\nnot hear me the servants sat by the chamberdoor and heard her\\nweeping the whole night through and in the morning informed their lord\\nof it and on the third evening when she had washed up she opened the\\nthird nut and within it was a still more beautiful dress which was\\nstiff with pure gold when the bride saw that she wanted to have it\\nbut the maiden only gave it up on condition that she might for the\\nthird time sleep in the bridegrooms apartment the kings son was\\nhowever on his guard and threw the sleepingdraught away now\\ntherefore when she began to weep and to cry dearest love i set thee\\nfree when thou wert in the iron stove in the terrible wild forest the\\nkings son leapt up and said thou art the true one thou art mine\\nand i am thine thereupon while it was still night he got into a\\ncarriage with her and they took away the false brides clothes so that\\nshe could not get up when they came to the great lake they sailed\\nacross it and when they reached the three sharpcutting swords they\\nseated themselves on the ploughwheel and when they got to the glass\\nmountain they thrust the three needles in it and so at length they got\\nto the little old house but when they went inside that it was a great\\ncastle and the toads were all disenchanted and were kings children\\nand full of happiness then the wedding was celebrated and the kings\\nson and the princess remained in the castle which was much larger than\\nthe castles of their fathers as however the old king grieved at\\nbeing left alone they fetched him away and brought him to live with\\nthem and they had two kingdoms and lived in

put the same question to him what\\nhe wanted to learn in the world i dont know yet he replied then\\ncome with me and be an astronomer there is nothing better than that\\nfor nothing is hid from you he liked the idea and became such a\\nskillful astronomer that when he had learnt everything and was about\\nto travel onwards his master gave him a telescope and said to him\\nwith that you canst thou see whatsoever takes place either on earth or\\nin heaven and nothing can remain concealed from thee a huntsman took\\nthe third brother into training and gave him such excellent\\ninstruction in

just in front of the house under a large tree and the father\\nsaid i will put you all to the test and see what you can do then\\nhe looked up and said to his second son between two branches up at\\nthe top of this tree there is a chaffinchs nest tell me how many\\neggs there are in it the astronomer took his glass looked up and\\nsaid there are five then the father said to the eldest fetch the\\neggs down without disturbing the bird which is sitting hatching them\\nthe skillful thief climbed up and took the five eggs from beneath the\\nbird which never observed what he was doing and remained quietly\\nsitting where she was and brought them down to his father the father\\ntook them and put one of them on each corner of the table and the\\nfifth in the middle and said to the huntsman with one shot thou\\nshalt shoot me the five eggs in two through the middle the huntsman\\naimed and shot the eggs all five as the father had desired and that\\nat one shot he certainly must have had some of the powder for shooting\\nround corners now its your turn said the father to the fourth son\\nyou shall sew the eggs together again and the young birds that are\\ninside them as well and you must do it so that they are not hurt by\\nthe shot the tailor brought his needle and sewed them as his father\\nwished when he had done this the thief had to climb up the tree again\\nand carry them to the nest and put them back again under the bird\\nwithout her being aware of it the bird sat her full time and after a\\nfew days the young ones crept out and they had a red line round their\\nnecks where they had been sewn together by the tailor\\n\\nwell said the old man to his sons i begin to think you are worth\\nmore than breen clover you have used your time well and learnt\\nsomething good i cant say which of you deserves the most praise that\\nwill be proved if you have but an early opportunity of using your\\ntalents not long after this there was a great uproar

should have her to wife the\\nfour brothers said to each other this would be a fine opportunity for\\nus to show what we can do and resolved to go forth together and\\nliberate the kings daughter i will soon know where she is said the\\nastronomer and looked through his telescope and said i see her\\nalready she is far away from here on a rock in the sea and the dragon\\nis beside her watching her then he went to the king and asked for a\\nship for himself and his brothers and sailed with them over the sea\\nuntil they came to the rock there the kings daughter was sitting and\\nthe dragon was lying asleep on her lap the huntsman said i dare not\\nfire i should kill the beautiful maiden at the same time then i\\nwill try my art said the thief and he crept thither and stole her\\naway from under the dragon so quietly and dexterously that the\\nmonster never remarked it but went on snoring full of joy they\\nhurried off with her on board ship and steered out into the open sea\\nbut the dragon who when he awoke had found no princess there followed\\nthem and came snorting angrily through the air just as he was\\ncircling above the ship and about to descend on it the huntsman\\nshouldered his gun and shot him to the heart the monster fell down\\ndead but was so large and powerful that his fall shattered the whole\\nship fortunately however they laid hold of a couple of planks and\\nswam about the wide sea then again they were in great peril but the\\ntailor who was not idle took his wondrous needle and with a few\\nstitches sewed the planks together and they seated themselves upon\\nthem and collected together all the fragments of the vessel then he\\nsewed these so skilfully together that in a very short time the ship\\nwas once more seaworthy and they could go home again in safety\\n\\nwhen the king once more saw his daughter there were great rejoicings\\nhe said to the four brothers one of you shall have her to wife but\\nwhich of you it is to be you must settle among yourselves then a warm\\ncontest arose among them for each of them preferred his own claim the\\nastronomer said if i had not seen the princess all your arts would\\nhave been useless so she is mine the thief said what would have\\nbeen the use of your seeing if i had not got her away from the dragon\\nso she is mine the huntsman said you and the princess and all of\\nyou would have been torn to pieces by the dragon if my ball had not\\nhit him so she is mine the tailor said and if i by my art had\\nnot sewn the ship together again you would all of you have been\\nmiserably drowned so she is mine then the king uttered this saying\\neach of you has an equal right and as all of you cannot have the\\nmaiden none of you shall have her but i will give to each of you as\\na reward half a kingdom the brothers were pleased with this\\ndecision and said it is better thus than that we should be at\\nvariance with each other then each of them received half a

was there and whether any one\\nbrought her anything to eat and drink so when twoeyes set out the\\nnext time oneeye went to her and said i will go with you to the\\npasture and see that the goat is well taken care of and driven where\\nthere is food but twoeyes knew what was in oneeyes mind and drove\\nthe goat into high grass and said come oneeye we will sit down\\nand i will sing something to you oneeye sat down and was tired with\\nthe unaccustomed walk and the heat of the sun and twoeyes sang\\nconstantly\\n\\none eye wakest thou\\none eye sleepest thou\\n\\n\\nuntil oneeye shut her one eye and fell asleep and as soon as\\ntwoeyes saw that oneeye was fast asleep and could discover nothing\\nshe said\\n\\nbleat my little goat bleat\\ncover the table with something to eat\\n\\n\\nand seated herself at her table and ate and drank until she was\\nsatisfied and then she again cried\\n\\nbleat bleat my little goat i pray\\nand take the table quite away\\n\\n\\nand in an instant all was gone twoeyes now awakened oneeye and\\nsaid oneeye you want to take care of the goat and go to sleep\\nwhile you are doing it and in the meantime the goat might run all over\\nthe world come let us go home again so they went home and again\\ntwoeyes let her little dish stand untouched and oneeye could not\\ntell her mother why she would not eat it and to excuse herself said\\ni fell asleep when i was out\\n\\nnext day the mother said to threeeyes this time thou shalt go and\\nobserve if twoeyes eats anything when she is out and if any one\\nfetches her food and drink for she must eat and drink in secret so\\nthreeeyes went to twoeyes and said i will go with you and see if\\nthe goat is taken proper care of and driven where there is food but\\ntwoeyes knew what was in threeeyes mind and drove the goat into\\nhigh grass and said we will sit down and i will sing something to\\nyou threeeyes threeeyes sat down and was tired with the walk and\\nwith the heat of the sun and twoeyes began the same song as before\\nand sang\\n\\nthree eyes are you waking\\n\\n\\nbut then instead of singing\\n\\nthree eyes are you sleeping\\n\\n\\nas she ought to have done she thoughtlessly sang\\n\\ntwo eyes are you sleeping\\n\\n\\nand sang all the time\\n\\nthree eyes are you waking\\ntwo eyes are you sleeping\\n\\n\\nthen two of the eyes which threeeyes had shut and fell asleep but\\nthe third as it had not been named in the song did not sleep it is\\ntrue that threeeyes shut it but only in her cunning to pretend it\\nwas asleep too but it blinked and could see everything very well and\\nwhen twoeyes thought that threeeyes was fast asleep she used her\\nlittle charm\\n\\nbleat my little goat bleat\\ncover the table with something to eat\\n\\n\\nand ate and drank as much as her heart desired and then ordered the\\ntable to go away again\\n\\nbleat bleat my little goat i pray\\nand take the table quite away\\n\\n\\nand threeeyes had seen everything then twoeyes came to her waked\\nher and said have you been asleep threeeyes you are a good\\ncaretaker come we will go home and when they got home twoeyes\\nagain did not eat and threeeyes said to the mother now i know why\\nthat highminded thing there does not eat when she is out she says to\\nthe goat\\n\\nbleat my little goat bleat\\ncover the table with something to eat\\n\\n\\nand then a little table appears before her covered with the best of\\nfood much better than any we have here and when she has eaten all she\\nwants she says\\n\\nbleat bleat my little goat i pray\\nand take the table quite away\\n\\n\\nand all disappears i watched everything closely she put two of my\\neyes to sleep by using a certain form of words but luckily the one in\\nmy forehead kept awake then the envious mother cried dost thou want\\nto fare better than we do the desire shall pass away and she fetched\\na butchers knife and thrust it into the heart of the goat which fell\\ndown dead\\n\\nwhen twoeyes saw that she went out full of trouble seated herself on\\nthe ridge of grass at the edge of the field and wept bitter tears\\nsuddenly the wise woman once more stood by her side and said\\ntwoeyes why art thou weeping have i not reason to weep she\\nanswered the goat which covered the table for me every day when i\\nspoke your charm has been killed by my mother and now i shall again\\nhave to bear hunger and want the wise woman said twoeyes i will\\ngive thee a piece of good advice ask thy sisters to give thee the\\nentrails of the slaughtered goat and bury them in the ground in front\\nof the house and thy fortune will be made then she vanished and\\ntwoeyes went home and said to her sisters dear sisters do give me\\nsome part of my goat i dont wish for what is good but give me the\\nentrails then they laughed and said if thats all you want you can\\nhave it so twoeyes took the entrails and buried them quietly in the\\nevening in front of the housedoor as the wise woman had counselled\\nher to do\\n\\nnext morning when they all awoke and went to the housedoor there\\nstood a strangely magnificent tree with leaves of silver and fruit of\\ngold hanging among them so that in all the wide world there was\\nnothing more beautiful or precious they did not know how the tree\\ncould have come there during the night but twoeyes saw that it had\\ngrown up out of the entrails of the goat for it was standing on the\\nexact spot where she had buried them then the mother said to oneeye\\nclimb up my child and gather some of the fruit of the tree for us\\noneeye climbed up but when she was about to get hold of one of the\\ngolden apples the branch escaped from her hands and that happened\\neach time so that she could not pluck a single apple let her do what\\nshe might then said the mother threeeyes do you climb up you with\\nyour three eyes can look about you better than oneeye oneeye\\nslipped down and threeeyes climbed up threeeyes was not more\\nskilful and might search as she liked but the golden apples always\\nescaped her at length the mother grew impatient and climbed up\\nherself but could get hold of the fruit no better than oneeye and\\nthreeeyes for she always clutched empty air then said twoeyes i\\nwill just go up perhaps i may succeed better the sisters cried you\\nindeed with your two eyes what can you do but twoeyes climbed up\\nand the golden apples did get out of her way but came into her hand of\\ntheir own accord so that she could pluck them one after the other and\\nbrought a whole apronful down with her the mother took them away from\\nher and instead of treating poor twoeyes any better for this she and\\noneeye and threeeyes were only envious because twoeyes alone had\\nbeen able to get the fruit and they treated her still more cruelly\\n\\nit so befell that once when they were all standing together by the\\ntree a young knight came up quick twoeyes cried the two sisters\\ncreep under this and dont disgrace us and with all speed they\\nturned an empty barrel which was standing close by the tree over poor\\ntwoeyes and they pushed the golden apples which she had been\\ngathering under it too when the knight came nearer he was a handsome\\nlord who stopped and admired the magnificent gold and silver tree and\\nsaid to the two sisters to whom does this fine tree belong any one\\nwho would bestow one branch of it on me might in return for it ask\\nwhatsoever he desired then oneeye and threeeyes replied that the\\ntree belonged to them and that they would give him a branch they both\\ntook great trouble but they were not able to do it for the branches\\nand fruit both moved away from them every time then said the knight\\nit is very strange that the tree should belong to you and that you\\nshould still not be able to break a piece off they again asserted\\nthat the tree was their property whilst they were saying so twoeyes\\nrolled out a couple of golden apples from under the barrel to the feet\\nof the knight for she was vexed with oneeye and threeeyes for not\\nspeaking the truth when the knight saw the apples he was astonished\\nand asked where they came from oneeye and threeeyes answered that\\nthey had another sister who was not allowed to show herself for she\\nhad only two eyes like any common person the knight however desired\\nto see her and cried twoeyes come forth then twoeyes quite\\ncomforted came from beneath the barrel and the knight was surprised\\nat her great beauty and said thou twoeyes canst certainly break\\noff a branch from the tree for me yes replied twoeyes that i\\ncertainly shall be able to do for the tree belongs to me and she\\nclimbed up and with the greatest ease broke off a branch with\\nbeautiful silver leaves and golden fruit and gave it to the knight\\nthen said the knight twoeyes what shall i give thee for it\\nalas answered twoeyes i suffer from hunger and thirst grief and\\nwant from early morning till late night if you would take me with\\nyou and deliver me from these things i should be happy so the\\nknight lifted twoeyes on to his horse and took her home with him to\\nhis fathers castle and there he gave her beautiful clothes and meat\\nand drink to her hearts content and as he loved her so much he\\nmarried her and the wedding was solemnized with great rejoicing when\\ntwoeyes was thus carried away by the handsome knight her two sisters\\ngrudged her good fortune in downright earnest the wonderful tree\\nhowever still remains with us thought they and even if we can\\ngather no fruit from it still every one will stand still and look at\\nit and come to us and admire it who knows what good things may be in\\nstore for us but next morning the tree had vanished and all their\\nhopes were at an end and when twoeyes looked out of the window of her\\nown little room to her great delight it was standing in front of it\\nand so it had followed her\\n\\ntwoeyes lived a long time in happiness once two poor women came to\\nher in her castle and begged for alms she looked in their faces and\\nrecognized her sisters oneeye and threeeyes who had fallen into\\nsuch poverty that they had to wander about and beg their bread from\\ndoor to door twoeyes however made them welcome and was kind to\\nthem and took care of them so that they both with all their hearts\\nrepented the evil that they had done their sister in their youth',\n",

       " 'there was once upon a time a king who had twelve daughters each one\\nmore beautiful than the other they all slept together in one chamber\\nin which their beds stood side by side and every night when they were\\nin them the king locked the door and bolted it but in the morning\\nwhen he unlocked the door he saw that their shoes were worn out with\\ndancing and no one could find out how that had come to pass then the\\nking caused it to be proclaimed that whosoever could discover where\\nthey danced at night should choose one of them for his wife and be\\nking after his death but that whosoever came forward and had not\\ndiscovered it within three days and nights should have forfeited his\\nlife it was not long before a kings son presented himself and\\noffered to undertake the enterprise he was well received and in the\\nevening was led into a room adjoining the princesses sleepingchamber\\nhis bed was placed there and he was to observe where they went and\\ndanced and in order that they might do nothing secretly or go away to\\nsome other place the door of their room was left open\\n\\nbut the eyelids of the prince grew heavy as lead and he fell asleep\\nand when he awoke in the morning all twelve had been to the dance for\\ntheir shoes were standing there with holes in the soles on the second\\nand third nights it fell out just the same and then his head was\\nstruck off without mercy many others came after this and undertook the\\nenterprise but all forfeited their lives now it came to pass that a\\npoor soldier who had a wound and could serve no longer found himself\\non the road to the town where the king lived there he met an old\\nwoman who asked him where he was going i hardly know myself\\nanswered he and added in jest i had half a mind to discover where\\nthe princesses danced their shoes into holes and thus become king\\nthat is not so difficult said the old woman you must not drink the\\nwine which will be brought to you at night and must pretend to be\\nsound asleep with that she gave him a little cloak and said if you\\nput on that you will be invisible and then you can steal after the\\ntwelve when the soldier had received this good advice he went into\\nthe thing in earnest took heart went to the king and announced\\nhimself as a suitor he was as well received as the others and royal\\ngarments were put upon him he was conducted that evening at bedtime\\ninto the antechamber and as he was about to go to bed the eldest\\ncame and brought him a cup of wine but he had tied a sponge under his\\nchin and let the wine run down into it without drinking a drop then\\nhe lay down and when he had lain a while he began to snore as if in\\nthe deepest sleep the twelve princesses heard that and laughed and\\nthe eldest said he too might as well have saved his life with\\nthat they got up opened wardrobes presses cupboards and brought out\\npretty dresses dressed themselves before the mirrors sprang about\\nand rejoiced at the prospect of the dance only the youngest said i\\nknow not how it is you are very happy but i feel very strange some\\nmisfortune is certainly about to befall us thou art a goose who art\\nalways frightened said the eldest hast thou forgotten how many\\nkings sons have already come here in vain i had hardly any need to\\ngive the soldier a sleepingdraught in any case the clown would not\\nhave awakened when they were all ready they looked carefully at the\\nsoldier but he had closed his eyes and did not move or stir so they\\nfelt themselves quite secure the eldest then went to her bed and\\ntapped it it immediately sank into the earth and one after the other\\nthey descended through the opening the eldest going first the\\nsoldier who had watched everything tarried no longer put on his\\nlittle cloak and went down last with the youngest halfway down the\\nsteps he just trod a little on her dress she was terrified at that\\nand cried out what is that who is pulling my dress dont be so\\nsilly said the eldest you have caught it on a nail then they went\\nall the way down and when they were at the bottom they were standing\\nin a wonderfully pretty avenue of trees all the leaves of which were\\nof silver and shone and glistened the soldier thought i must carry\\na token away with me and broke off a twig from one of them on which\\nthe tree cracked with a loud report the youngest cried out again\\nsomething is wrong did you hear the crack but the eldest said it\\nis a gun fired for joy because we have got rid of our prince so\\nquickly after that they came into an avenue where all the leaves were\\nof gold and lastly into a third where they were of bright diamonds he\\nbroke off a twig from each which made such a crack each time that the\\nyoungest started back in terror but the eldest still maintained that\\nthey were salutes they went on and came to a great lake whereon stood\\ntwelve little boats and in every boat sat a handsome prince all of\\nwhom were waiting for the twelve and each took one of them with him\\nbut the soldier seated himself by the youngest then her prince said\\ni cant tell why the boat is so much heavier today i shall have to\\nrow with all my strength if i am to get it across what should cause\\nthat said the youngest but the warm weather i feel very warm too\\non the opposite side of the lake stood a splendid brightlylit castle\\nfrom whence resounded the joyous music of trumpets and kettledrums\\nthey rowed over there entered and each prince danced with the girl he\\nloved but the soldier danced with them unseen and when one of them\\nhad a cup of wine in her hand he drank it up so that the cup was empty\\nwhen she carried it to her mouth the youngest was alarmed at this but\\nthe eldest always made her be silent they danced there till three\\noclock in the morning when all the shoes were danced into holes and\\nthey were forced to leave off the princes rowed them back again over\\nthe lake and this time the soldier seated himself by the eldest on\\nthe shore they took leave of their princes and promised to return the\\nfollowing night when they reached the stairs the soldier ran on in\\nfront and lay down in his bed and when the twelve had come up slowly\\nand wearily he was already snoring so loudly that they could all hear\\nhim and they said so far as he is concerned we are safe they took\\noff their beautiful dresses laid them away put the wornout shoes\\nunder the bed and lay down next morning the soldier was resolved not\\nto speak but to watch the wonderful goings on and again went with\\nthem then everything was done just as it had been done the first time\\nand each time they danced until their shoes were worn to pieces but\\nthe third time he took a cup away with him as a token when the hour\\nhad arrived for him to give his answer he took the three twigs and the\\ncup and went to the king but the twelve stood behind the door and\\nlistened for what he was going to say when the king put the question\\nwhere have my twelve daughters danced their shoes to pieces in the\\nnight he answered in an underground castle with twelve princes\\nand related how it had come to pass and brought out the tokens the\\nking then summoned his daughters and asked them if the soldier had\\ntold the truth and when they saw that they were betrayed and that\\nfalsehood would be of no avail they were obliged to confess all\\nthereupon the king asked which of them he would have to wife he\\nanswered i am no longer young so give me the

       " 'in former times there lived an aged queen who was a sorceress and her\\ndaughter was the most beautiful maiden under the sun the old woman\\nhowever had no other thought than how to lure mankind to destruction\\nand when a wooer appeared she said that whosoever wished to have her\\ndaughter must first perform a task or die many had been dazzled by\\nthe daughters beauty and had actually risked this but they never\\ncould accomplish what the old woman enjoined them to do and then no\\nmercy was shown they had to kneel down and their heads were struck\\noff a certain kings son who had also heard of the maidens beauty\\nsaid to his father let me go there i want to demand her in\\nmarriage never answered the king if you were to go it would be\\ngoing to your death on this the son lay down and was sick unto death\\nand for seven years he lay there and no physician could heal him when\\nthe father perceived that all hope was over with a heavy heart he said\\nto him go thither and try your luck for i know no other means of\\ncuring you when the son heard that he rose from his bed and was well\\nagain and joyfully set out on his way\\n\\nand it came to pass that as he was riding across a heath he saw from\\nafar something like a great heap of hay lying on the ground and when\\nhe drew nearer he could see that it was the stomach of a man who had\\nlaid himself down there but the stomach looked like a small mountain\\nwhen the fat man saw the traveller he stood up and said if you are\\nin need of any one take me into your service the prince answered\\nwhat can i do with such a great big man oh said the stout one\\nthis is nothing when i stretch myself out well i am three thousand\\ntimes fatter if thats the case said the prince i can make use\\nof thee come with me so the stout one followed the prince and after\\na while they found another man who was lying on the ground with his ear\\nlaid to the turf what art thou doing there asked the kings son i\\nam listening replied the man what art thou listening to so\\nattentively i am listening to what is just going on in the world\\nfor nothing escapes my ears i even hear the grass growing tell me\\nsaid the prince what thou hearest at the court of the old queen who\\nhas the beautiful daughter then he answered i hear the whizzing of\\nthe sword that is striking off a wooers head the kings son said i\\ncan make use of thee come with me they went onwards and then saw a\\npair of feet lying and part of a pair of legs but could not see the\\nrest of the body when they had walked on for a great distance they\\ncame to the body and at last to the head also why said the prince\\nwhat a tall rascal thou art oh replied the tall one that is\\nnothing at all yet when i really stretch out my limbs i am three\\nthousand times as tall and taller than the highest mountain on earth\\ni will gladly enter your service if you will take me come with me\\nsaid the prince i can make use of thee they went onwards and found\\na man sitting by the road who had bound up his eyes the prince said to\\nhim hast thou weak eyes that thou canst not look at the light\\nno replied the man but i must not remove the bandage for\\nwhatsoever i look at with my eyes splits to pieces my glance is so\\npowerful if you can use that i shall be glad to serve you come\\nwith me replied the kings son i can make use of thee they\\njourneyed onwards and found a man who was lying in the hot sunshine\\ntrembling and shivering all over his body so that not a limb was\\nstill how canst thou shiver when the sun is shining so warm said\\nthe kings son alack replied the man i am of quite a different\\nnature the hotter it is the colder i am and the frost pierces\\nthrough all my bones and the colder it is the hotter i am in the\\nmidst of ice i cannot endure the heat nor in the midst of fire the\\ncold thou art a strange fellow said the prince but if thou wilt\\nenter my service follow me they travelled onwards and saw a man\\nstanding who made a long neck and looked about him and could see over\\nall the mountains what art thou looking at so eagerly said the\\nkings son the man replied i have such sharp eyes that i can see\\ninto every forest and field and hill and valley all over the world\\nthe prince said come with me if thou wilt for i am still in want of\\nsuch an one\\n\\nand now the kings son and his six servants came to the town where the\\naged queen dwelt he did not tell her who he was but said if you\\nwill give me your beautiful daughter i will perform any task you set\\nme the sorceress was delighted to get such a handsome youth as this\\ninto her net and said i will set thee three tasks and if thou art\\nable to perform them all thou shalt be husband and master of my\\ndaughter what is the first to be thou shalt fetch me my ring\\nwhich i have dropped into the red sea so the kings son went home to\\nhis servants and said the first task is not easy a ring is to be got\\nout of the red sea come find some way of doing it then the man with\\nthe sharp sight said i will see where it is lying and looked down\\ninto the water and said it is sticking there on a pointed stone\\nthe tall one carried them thither and said i would soon get it out\\nif i could only see it oh is that all cried the stout one and\\nlay down and put his mouth to the water on which all the waves fell\\ninto it just as if it had been a whirlpool and he drank up the whole\\nsea till it was as dry as a meadow the tall one stooped down a little\\nand brought out the ring with his hand then the kings son rejoiced\\nwhen he had the ring and took it to the old queen she was astonished\\nand said yes it is the right ring thou hast safely performed the\\nfirst task but now comes the second dost thou see the meadow in front\\nof my palace three hundred fat oxen are feeding there and these must\\nthou eat skin hair bones horns and all and down below in my cellar\\nlie three hundred casks of wine and these thou must drink up as well\\nand if one hair of the oxen or one little drop of the wine is left\\nthy life will be forfeited to me may i invite no guests to this\\nrepast inquired the prince no dinner is good without some company\\nthe old woman laughed maliciously and replied thou mayst invite one\\nfor the sake of companionship but no more\\n\\nthe kings son went to his servants and said to the stout one thou\\nshalt be my guest today and shalt eat thy fill hereupon the stout\\none stretched himself out and ate the three hundred oxen without\\nleaving one single hair and then he asked if he was to have nothing\\nbut his breakfast he drank the wine straight from the casks without\\nfeeling any need of a glass and he licked the last drop from his\\nfingernails when the meal was over the prince went to the old woman\\nand told her that the second task also was performed she wondered at\\nthis and said no one has ever done so much before but one task still\\nremains and she thought to herself thou shalt not escape me and\\nwilt not keep thy head on thy shoulders this night said she i will\\nbring my daughter to thee in thy chamber and thou shalt put thine arms\\nround her but when you are sitting there together beware of falling\\nasleep when twelve oclock is striking i will come and if she is\\nthen no longer in thine arms thou art lost the prince thought the\\ntask is easy i will most certainly keep my eyes open nevertheless he\\ncalled his servants told them what the old woman had said and\\nremarked who knows what treachery lurks behind this foresight is a\\ngood thing keep watch and take care that the maiden does not go out of\\nmy room again when night fell the old woman came with her daughter\\nand gave her into the princess arms and then the tall one wound\\nhimself round the two in a circle and the stout one placed himself by\\nthe door so that no living creature could enter there the two sat\\nand the maiden spake never a word but the moon shone through the\\nwindow on her face and the prince could behold her wondrous beauty he\\ndid nothing but gaze at her and was filled with love and happiness\\nand his eyes never felt weary this lasted until eleven oclock when\\nthe old woman cast such a spell over all of them that they fell asleep\\nand at the selfsame moment the maiden was carried away\\n\\nthen they all slept soundly until a quarter to twelve when the magic\\nlost its power and all awoke again oh misery and misfortune cried\\nthe prince now i am lost the faithful servants also began to\\nlament but the listener said be quiet i want to listen then he\\nlistened for an instant and said she is on a rock three hundred\\nleagues from hence bewailing her fate thou alone tall one canst\\nhelp her if thou wilt stand up thou wilt be there in a couple of\\nsteps\\n\\nyes answered the tall one but the one with the sharp eyes must go\\nwith me that we may destroy the rock then the tall one took the one\\nwith bandaged eyes on his back and in the twinkling of an eye they\\nwere on the enchanted rock the tall one immediately took the bandage\\nfrom the others eyes and he did but look round and the rock shivered\\ninto a thousand pieces then the tall one took the maiden in his arms\\ncarried her back in a second then fetched his companion with the same\\nrapidity and before it struck twelve they were all sitting as they had\\nsat before quite merrily and happily when twelve struck the aged\\nsorceress came stealing in with a malicious face which seemed to say\\nnow he is mine for she believed that her daughter was on the rock\\nthree hundred leagues off but when she saw her in the princes arms\\nshe was alarmed and said here is one who knows more than i do she\\ndared not make any opposition and was forced to give him her daughter\\nbut she whispered in her ear it is a disgrace to thee to have to obey\\ncommon people and that thou art not allowed to choose a husband to\\nthine own liking\\n\\non this the proud heart of the maiden was filled with anger and she\\nmeditated revenge next morning she caused three hundred great bundles\\nof wood to be got together and said to the prince that though the\\nthree tasks were performed she would still not be his wife until some\\none was ready to seat himself in the midst of the wood and bear the\\nfire she thought that none of his servants would let themselves be\\nburnt for him and that out of love for her he himself would place\\nhimself upon it and then she would be free but the servants said\\nevery one of us has done something except the frosty one he must set\\nto work and they put him in the middle of the pile and set fire to\\nit then the fire began to burn and burnt for three days until all the\\nwood was consumed and when the flames had burnt out the frosty one\\nwas standing amid the ashes trembling like an aspen leaf and saying\\ni never felt such a frost during the whole course of my life if it\\nhad lasted much longer i should have been benumbed\\n\\nas no other pretext was to be found the beautiful maiden was now\\nforced to take the unknown youth as a husband but when they drove away\\nto church the old woman said i cannot endure the disgrace and sent\\nher warriors after them with orders to cut down all who opposed them\\nand bring back her daughter but the listener had sharpened his ears\\nand heard the secret discourse of the old woman what shall we do\\nsaid he to the stout one but he knew what to do and spat out once or\\ntwice behind the carriage some of the seawater which he had drunk and\\na great sea arose in which the warriors were caught and drowned when\\nthe sorceress perceived that she sent her mailed knights but the\\nlistener heard the rattling of their armour and undid the bandage from\\none eye of sharpeyes who looked for a while rather fixedly at the\\nenemys troops on which they all sprang to pieces like glass then the\\nyouth and the maiden went on their way undisturbed and when the two\\nhad been blessed in church the six servants took leave and said to\\ntheir master your wishes are now satisfied you need us no longer we\\nwill go our way and seek our fortunes\\n\\nhalf a league from the palace of the princes father was a village near\\nwhich a swineherd tended his herd and when they came thither the\\nprince said to his wife do you know who i really am i am no prince\\nbut a herder of swine and the man who is there with that herd is my\\nfather we two shall have to set to work also and help him then he\\nalighted with her at the inn and secretly told the innkeepers to take\\naway her royal apparel during the night so when she awoke in the\\nmorning she had nothing to put on and the innkeepers wife gave her\\nan old gown and a pair of worsted stockings and at the same time\\nseemed to consider it a great present and said if it were not for\\nthe sake of your husband i should have given you nothing at all then\\nthe princess believed that he really was a swineherd and tended the\\nherd with him and thought to herself i have deserved this for my\\nhaughtiness and pride this lasted for a week and then she could\\nendure it no longer for she had sores on her feet and now came a\\ncouple of people who asked if she knew who her husband was yes she\\nanswered he is a swineherd and has just gone out with cords and\\nropes to try to drive a little bargain but they said just come with\\nus and we will take you to him and they took her up to the palace\\nand when she entered the hall there stood her husband in kingly\\nraiment but she did not recognize him until he took her in his arms\\nkissed her and said i suffered much for thee and now thou too hast\\nhad to suffer for me and then the wedding was celebrated and he who\\nhas told you all this wishes that he too had been present at it',\n",
       " 'a woman was going about the unenclosed land with her daughter and her\\nstepdaughter cutting fodder when the lord came walking towards them\\nin the form of a poor man and asked which is the way into the\\nvillage if you want to know said the mother seek it for\\nyourself and the daughter added if you are afraid you will not find\\nit take a guide with you but the stepdaughter said poor man i\\nwill take you there come with me then god was angry with the mother\\nand daughter and turned his back on them and wished that they should\\nbecome as black as night and as ugly as sin to the poor stepdaughter\\nhowever god was gracious and went with her and when they were near\\nthe village he said a blessing over her and spake choose three\\nthings for thyself and i will grant them to thee then said the\\nmaiden i should like to be as beautiful and fair as the sun and\\ninstantly she was white and fair as day then i should like to have a\\npurse of money which would never grow empty that the lord gave her\\nalso but he said do not forget what is best of all said she for\\nmy third wish i desire after my death to inhabit the eternal kingdom\\nof heaven that also was granted unto her and then the lord left her\\nwhen the stepmother came home with her daughter and they saw that\\nthey were both as black as coal and ugly but that the stepdaughter\\nwas white and beautiful wickedness increased still more in their\\nhearts and they thought of nothing else but how they could do her an\\ninjury the stepdaughter however had a brother called reginer whom\\nshe loved much and she told him all that had happened once on a time\\nreginer said to her dear sister i will take thy likeness that i may\\ncontinually see thee before mine eyes for my love for thee is so great\\nthat i should like always to look at thee then she answered but i\\npray thee let no one see the picture so he painted his sister and\\nhung up the picture in his room he however dwelt in the kings\\npalace for he was his coachman every day he went and stood before the\\npicture and thanked god for the happiness of having such a dear\\nsister now it happened that the king whom he served had just lost his\\nwife who had been so beautiful that no one could be found to compare\\nwith her and on this account the king was in deep grief the\\nattendants about the court however remarked that the coachman stood\\ndaily before this beautiful picture and they were jealous of him so\\nthey informed the king then the latter ordered the picture to be\\nbrought to him and when he saw that it was like his lost wife in every\\nrespect except that it was still more beautiful he fell mortally in\\nlove with it he caused the coachman to be brought before him and\\nasked whom the portrait represented the coachman said it was his\\nsister so the king resolved to take no one but her as his wife and\\ngave him a carriage and horses and splendid garments of cloth of gold\\nand sent him forth to fetch his chosen bride when reginer came on this\\nerrand his sister was glad but the black maiden was jealous of her\\ngood fortune and grew angry above all measure and said to her mother\\nof what use are all your arts to us now when you cannot procure such a\\npiece of luck for me be quiet said the old woman i will soon\\ndivert it to you and by her arts of witchcraft she so troubled the\\neyes of the coachman that he was halfblind and she stopped the ears\\nof the white maiden so that she was halfdeaf then they got into the\\ncarriage first the bride in her noble royal apparel then the\\nstepmother with her daughter and reginer sat on the box to drive\\nwhen they had been on the way for some time the coachman cried\\n\\ncover thee well my sister dear\\nthat the rain may not wet thee\\nthat the wind may not load thee with dust\\nthat thou mayst be fair and beautiful\\nwhen thou appearest before the king\\n\\n\\nthe bride asked what is my dear brother saying ah said the old\\nwoman he says that you ought to take off your golden dress and give\\nit to your sister then she took it off and put it on the black\\nmaiden who gave her in exchange for it a shabby grey gown they drove\\nonwards and a short time afterwards the brother again cried\\n\\ncover thee well my sister dear\\nthat the rain may not wet thee\\nthat the wind may not load thee with dust\\nthat thou mayst be fair and beautiful\\nwhen thou appearest before the king\\n\\n\\nthe bride asked what is my dear brother saying ah said the old\\nwoman he says that you ought to take off your golden hood and give it\\nto your sister so she took off the hood and put it on her sister and\\nsat with her own head uncovered and they drove on farther after a\\nwhile the brother once more cried\\n\\ncover thee well my sister dear\\nthat the rain may not wet thee\\nthat the wind may not load thee with dust\\nthat thou mayst be fair and beautiful\\nwhen thou appearest before the king\\n\\n\\nthe bride asked what is my dear brother saying ah said the old\\nwoman he says you must look out of the carriage they were however\\njust on a bridge which crossed deep water when the bride stood up and\\nleant forward out of the carriage they both pushed her out and she\\nfell into the middle of the water at the same moment that she sank a\\nsnowwhite duck arose out of the mirrorsmooth water and swam down the\\nriver the brother had observed nothing of it and drove the carriage\\non until they reached the court then he took the black maiden to the\\nking as his sister and thought she really was so because his eyes\\nwere dim and he saw the golden garments glittering when the king saw\\nthe boundless ugliness of his intended bride he was very angry and\\nordered the coachman to be thrown into a pit which was full of adders\\nand nests of snakes the old witch however knew so well how to\\nflatter the king and deceive his eyes by her arts that he kept her and\\nher daughter until she appeared quite endurable to him and he really\\nmarried her\\n\\none evening when the black bride was sitting on the kings knee a\\nwhite duck came swimming up the gutter to the kitchen and said to the\\nkitchenboy boy light a fire that i may warm my feathers the\\nkitchenboy did it and lighted a fire on the hearth then came the\\nduck and sat down by it and shook herself and smoothed her feathers to\\nrights with her bill while she was thus sitting and enjoying herself\\nshe asked what is my brother reginer doing the sculleryboy\\nreplied he is imprisoned in the pit with adders and with snakes\\nthen she asked what is the black witch doing in the house the boy\\nanswered she is loved by the king and happy\\n\\nmay god have mercy on him said the duck and swam forth by the sink\\n\\nthe next night she came again and put the same questions and the third\\nnight also then the kitchenboy could bear it no longer and went to\\nthe king and discovered all to him the king however wanted to see it\\nfor himself and next evening went thither and when the duck thrust\\nher head in through the sink he took his sword and cut through her\\nneck and suddenly she changed into a most beautiful maiden exactly\\nlike the picture which her brother had made of her the king was full\\nof joy and as she stood there quite wet he caused splendid apparel to\\nbe brought and had her clothed in it then she told how she had been\\nbetrayed by cunning and falsehood and at last thrown down into the\\nwater and her first request was that her brother should be brought\\nforth from the pit of snakes and when the king had fulfilled this\\nrequest he went into the chamber where the old witch was and asked\\nwhat does she deserve who does this and that and related what had\\nhappened then was she so blinded that she was aware of nothing and\\nsaid she deserves to be stripped naked and put into a barrel with\\nnails and that a horse should be harnessed to the barrel and the\\nhorse sent all over the world all of which was done to her and to\\nher black daughter but the king married the white and beautiful bride\\nand rewarded her faithful brother and made him a rich and\\ndistinguished man',\n",
       " 'there was once on a time a king who had a great forest near his palace\\nfull of all kinds of wild animals one day he sent out a huntsman to\\nshoot him a roe but he did not come back perhaps some accident has\\nbefallen him said the king and the next day he sent out two more\\nhuntsmen who were to search for him but they too stayed away then on\\nthe third day he sent for all his huntsmen and said scour the whole\\nforest through and do not give up until ye have found all three but\\nof these also none came home again and of the pack of hounds which\\nthey had taken with them none were seen more from that time forth no\\none would any longer venture into the forest and it lay there in deep\\nstillness and solitude and nothing was seen of it but sometimes an\\neagle or a hawk flying over it this lasted for many years when a\\nstrange huntsman announced himself to the king as seeking a situation\\nand offered to go into the dangerous forest the king however would\\nnot give his consent and said it is not safe in there i fear it\\nwould fare with thee no better than with the others and thou wouldst\\nnever come out again the huntsman replied lord i will venture it\\nat my own risk of fear i know nothing\\n\\nthe huntsman therefore betook himself with his dog to the forest it\\nwas not long before the dog fell in with some game on the way and\\nwanted to pursue it but hardly had the dog run two steps when it stood\\nbefore a deep pool could go no farther and a naked arm stretched\\nitself out of the water seized it and drew it under when the\\nhuntsman saw that he went back and fetched three men to come with\\nbuckets and bale out the water when they could see to the bottom there\\nlay a wild man whose body was brown like rusty iron and whose hair\\nhung over his face down to his knees they bound him with cords and\\nled him away to the castle there was great astonishment over the wild\\nman the king however had him put in an iron cage in his courtyard\\nand forbade the door to be opened on pain of death and the queen\\nherself was to take the key into her keeping and from this time forth\\nevery one could again go into the forest with safety\\n\\nthe king had a son of eight years who was once playing in the\\ncourtyard and while he was playing his golden ball fell into the\\ncage the boy ran thither and said give me my ball out not till\\nthou hast opened the door for me answered the man no said the\\nboy i will not do that the king has forbidden it and ran away the\\nnext day he again went and asked for his ball the wild man said open\\nmy door but the boy would not on the third day the king had ridden\\nout hunting and the boy went once more and said i cannot open the\\ndoor even if i wished for i have not the key then the wild man said\\nit lies under thy mothers pillow thou canst get it there the boy\\nwho wanted to have his ball back cast all thought to the winds and\\nbrought the key the door opened with difficulty and the boy pinched\\nhis fingers when it was open the wild man stepped out gave him the\\ngolden ball and hurried away the boy had become afraid he called and\\ncried after him oh wild man do not go away or i shall be beaten\\nthe wild man turned back took him up set him on his shoulder and\\nwent with hasty steps into the forest when the king came home he\\nobserved the empty cage and asked the queen how that had happened she\\nknew nothing about it and sought the key but it was gone she called\\nthe boy but no one answered the king sent out people to seek for him\\nin the fields but they did not find him then he could easily guess\\nwhat had happened and much grief reigned in the royal court\\n\\nwhen the wild man had once more reached the dark forest he took the\\nboy down from his shoulder and said to him thou wilt never see thy\\nfather and mother again but i will keep thee with me for thou hast\\nset me free and i have compassion on thee if thou dost all i bid\\nthee thou shalt fare well of treasure and gold have i enough and\\nmore than anyone in the world he made a bed of moss for the boy on\\nwhich he slept and the next morning the man took him to a well and\\nsaid behold the gold well is as bright and clear as crystal thou\\nshalt sit beside it and take care that nothing falls into it or it\\nwill be polluted i will come every evening to see if thou hast obeyed\\nmy order the boy placed himself by the margin of the well and often\\nsaw a golden fish or a golden snake show itself therein and took care\\nthat nothing fell in as he was thus sitting his finger hurt him so\\nviolently that he involuntarily put it in the water he drew it quickly\\nout again but saw that it was quite gilded and whatsoever pains he\\ntook to wash the gold off again all was to no purpose in the evening\\niron john came back looked at the boy and said what has happened to\\nthe well nothing nothing he answered and held his finger behind\\nhis back that the man might not see it but he said thou hast dipped\\nthy finger into the water this time it may pass but take care thou\\ndost not again let anything go in by daybreak the boy was already\\nsitting by the well and watching it his finger hurt him again and he\\npassed it over his head and then unhappily a hair fell down into the\\nwell he took it quickly out but it was already quite gilded iron\\njohn came and already knew what had happened thou hast let a hair\\nfall into the well said he i will allow thee to watch by it once\\nmore but if this happens for the third time then the well is polluted\\nand thou canst no longer remain with me\\n\\non the third day the boy sat by the well and did not stir his finger\\nhowever much it hurt him but the time was long to him and he looked\\nat the reflection of his face on the surface of the water and as he\\nstill bent down more and more while he was doing so and trying to look\\nstraight into the eyes his long hair fell down from his shoulders into\\nthe water he raised himself up quickly but the whole of the hair of\\nhis head was already golden and shone like the sun you may imagine how\\nterrified the poor boy was he took his pockethandkerchief and tied it\\nround his head in order that the man might not see it when he came he\\nalready knew everything and said take the handkerchief off then\\nthe golden hair streamed forth and let the boy excuse himself as he\\nmight it was of no use thou hast not stood the trial and canst stay\\nhere no longer go forth into the world there thou wilt learn what\\npoverty is but as thou hast not a bad heart and as i mean well by\\nthee there is one thing i will grant thee if thou fallest into any\\ndifficulty come to the forest and cry iron john and then i will\\ncome and help thee my power is great greater than thou thinkest and\\ni have gold and silver in abundance\\n\\nthen the kings son left the forest and walked by beaten and unbeaten\\npaths ever onwards until at length he reached a great city there he\\nlooked for work but could find none and he had learnt nothing by\\nwhich he could help himself at length he went to the palace and asked\\nif they would take him in the people about court did not at all know\\nwhat use they could make of him but they liked him and told him to\\nstay at length the cook took him into his service and said he might\\ncarry wood and water and rake the cinders together once when it so\\nhappened that no one else was at hand the cook ordered him to carry\\nthe food to the royal table but as he did not like to let his golden\\nhair be seen he kept his little cap on such a thing as that had never\\nyet come under the kings notice and he said when thou comest to the\\nroyal table thou must take thy hat off he answered ah lord i\\ncannot i have a bad sore place on my head then the king had the cook\\ncalled before him and scolded him and asked how he could take such a\\nboy as that into his service and that he was to turn him off at once\\nthe cook however had pity on him and exchanged him for the\\ngardeners boy\\n\\nand now the boy had to plant and water the garden hoe and dig and\\nbear the wind and bad weather once in summer when he was working alone\\nin the garden the day was so warm he took his little cap off that the\\nair might cool him as the sun shone on his hair it glittered and\\nflashed so that the rays fell into the bedroom of the kings daughter\\nand up she sprang to see what that could be then she saw the boy and\\ncried to him boy bring me a wreath of flowers he put his cap on\\nwith all haste and gathered wild fieldflowers and bound them\\ntogether when he was ascending the stairs with them the gardener met\\nhim and said how canst thou take the kings daughter a garland of\\nsuch common flowers go quickly and get another and seek out the\\nprettiest and rarest oh no replied the boy the wild ones have\\nmore scent and will please her better when he got into the room the\\nkings daughter said take thy cap off it is not seemly to keep it on\\nin my presence he again said i may not i have a sore head she\\nhowever caught at his cap and pulled it off and then his golden hair\\nrolled down on his shoulders and it was splendid to behold he wanted\\nto run out but she held him by the arm and gave him a handful of\\nducats with these he departed but he cared nothing for the gold\\npieces he took them to the gardener and said i present them to thy\\nchildren they can play with them the following day the kings\\ndaughter again called to him that he was to bring her a wreath of\\nfieldflowers and when he went in with it she instantly snatched at\\nhis cap and wanted to take it away from him but he held it fast with\\nboth hands she again gave him a handful of ducats but he would not\\nkeep them and gave them to the gardener for playthings for his\\nchildren on the third day things went just the same she could not get\\nhis cap away from him and he would not have her money\\n\\nnot long afterwards the country was overrun by war the king gathered\\ntogether his people and did not know whether or not he could offer any\\nopposition to the enemy who was superior in strength and had a mighty\\narmy then said the gardeners boy i am grown up and will go to the\\nwars also only give me a horse the others laughed and said seek\\none for thyself when we are gone we will leave one behind us in the\\nstable for thee when they had gone forth he went into the stable\\nand got the horse out it was lame of one foot and limped hobblety\\njig hobblety jig nevertheless he mounted it and rode away to the\\ndark forest when he came to the outskirts he called iron john\\nthree times so loudly that it echoed through the trees thereupon the\\nwild man appeared immediately and said what dost thou desire i\\nwant a strong steed for i am going to the wars that thou shalt\\nhave and still more than thou askest for then the wild man went back\\ninto the forest and it was not long before a stableboy came out of\\nit who led a horse that snorted with its nostrils and could hardly be\\nrestrained and behind them followed a great troop of soldiers entirely\\nequipped in iron and their swords flashed in the sun the youth made\\nover his threelegged horse to the stableboy mounted the other and\\nrode at the head of the soldiers when he got near the battlefield a\\ngreat part of the kings men had already fallen and little was wanting\\nto make the rest give way then the youth galloped thither with his\\niron soldiers broke like a hurricane over the enemy and beat down all\\nwho opposed him they began to fly but the youth pursued and never\\nstopped until there was not a single man left instead however of\\nreturning to the king he conducted his troop by byeways back to the\\nforest and called forth iron john what dost thou desire asked the\\nwild man take back thy horse and thy troops and give me my\\nthreelegged horse again all that he asked was done and soon he was\\nriding on his threelegged horse when the king returned to his palace\\nhis daughter went to meet him and wished him joy of his victory i am\\nnot the one who carried away the victory said he but a stranger\\nknight who came to my assistance with his soldiers the daughter\\nwanted to hear who the strange knight was but the king did not know\\nand said he followed the enemy and i did not see him again she\\ninquired of the gardener where his boy was but he smiled and said\\nhe has just come home on his threelegged horse and the others have\\nbeen mocking him and crying here comes our hobblety jig back again\\nthey asked too under what hedge hast thou been lying sleeping all\\nthe time he however said i did the best of all and it would have\\ngone badly without me and then he was still more ridiculed\\n\\nthe king said to his daughter i will proclaim a great feast that\\nshall last for three days and thou shalt throw a golden apple perhaps\\nthe unknown will come to it when the feast was announced the youth\\nwent out to the forest and called iron john what dost thou desire\\nasked he that i may catch the kings daughters golden apple it is\\nas safe as if thou hadst it already said iron john thou shalt\\nlikewise have a suit of red armour for the occasion and ride on a\\nspirited chestnuthorse when the day came the youth galloped to the\\nspot took his place amongst the knights and was recognized by no one\\nthe kings daughter came forward and threw a golden apple to the\\nknights but none of them caught it but he only as soon as he had it\\nhe galloped away\\n\\non the second day iron john equipped him as a white knight and gave\\nhim a white horse again he was the only one who caught the apple and\\nhe did not linger an instant but galloped off with it the king grew\\nangry and said that is not allowed he must appear before me and\\ntell his name he gave the order that if the knight who caught the\\napple should go away again they should pursue him and if he would not\\ncome back willingly they were to cut him down and stab him\\n\\non the third day he received from iron john a suit of black armour and\\na black horse and again he caught the apple but when he was riding\\noff with it the kings attendants pursued him and one of them got so\\nnear him that he wounded the youths leg with the point of his sword\\nthe youth nevertheless escaped from them but his horse leapt so\\nviolently that the helmet fell from the youths head and they could\\nsee that he had golden hair they rode back and announced this to the\\nking\\n\\nthe following day the kings daughter asked the gardener about his boy\\nhe is at work in the garden the queer creature has been at the\\nfestival too and only came home yesterday evening he has likewise\\nshown my children three golden apples which he has won\\n\\nthe king had him summoned into his presence and he came and again had\\nhis little cap on his head but the kings daughter went up to him and\\ntook it off and then his golden hair fell down over his shoulders and\\nhe was so handsome that all were amazed art thou the knight who came\\nevery day to the festival always in different colours and who caught\\nthe three golden apples asked the king yes answered he and here\\nthe apples are and he took them out of his pocket and returned them\\nto the king if you desire further proof you may see the wound which\\nyour people gave me when they followed me but i am likewise the knight\\nwho helped you to your victory over your enemies if thou canst\\nperform such deeds as that thou art no gardeners boy tell me who is\\nthy father my father is a mighty king and gold have i in plenty as\\ngreat as i require i well see said the king that i owe thanks to\\nthee can i do anything to please thee yes answered he that\\nindeed you can give me your daughter to wife the maiden laughed and\\nsaid he does not stand much on ceremony but i have already seen by\\nhis golden hair that he was no gardeners boy and then she went and\\nkissed him his father and mother came to the wedding and were in\\ngreat delight for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their dear\\nson again and as they were sitting at the marriagefeast the music\\nsuddenly stopped the doors opened and a stately king came in with a\\ngreat retinue he

take away\\nthe manure from the horses stable and load the cart with it i let it\\ngo on slowly and if i have taken anything on the fork i only\\nhalfraise it up and then i rest just a quarter of an hour until i\\nquite throw it in it is enough and to spare if i take out a cartful in\\nthe day i have no fancy for killing myself with work\\n\\nthe sixth said shame on ye i am afraid of no work but i lie down\\nfor three weeks and never once take my clothes off what is the use of\\nbuckling your shoes on for aught i care they may fall off my feet it\\nis no matter if i am going up some steps i drag one foot slowly after\\nthe other on to the first step and then i count the rest of them that\\ni may know where i must rest\\n\\nthe seventh said that will not do with me my master looks after my\\nwork only he is not at home the whole day but i neglect nothing i\\nrun as fast as it is possible to do when one crawls if i am to get on\\nfour sturdy men must push me with all their might i came where six men\\nwere lying sleeping on a bed beside each other i lay down by them and\\nslept too there was no wakening me again and when they wanted to have\\nme home they had to carry me the eighth said i see plainly that i\\nam the only active fellow if a stone lie before me i do not give\\nmyself the trouble to raise my legs and step over it i lay myself down\\non the ground and if i am wet and covered with mud and dirt i stay\\nlying until the sun has dried me again at the very most i only turn\\nmyself so that it can shine on me the ninth said that is the right\\nway today the bread was before me but i was too idle to take it and\\nnearly died of hunger moreover a jug stood by it but it was so big\\nand heavy that i did not like to lift it up and preferred bearing\\nthirst

lying\\nin the road and i had my legs stretched out some one came with a\\ncart and the wheels went over me i might indeed have drawn my legs\\nback but i did not hear the cart coming for the midges were humming\\nabout my ears and creeping in at my nose and out again at my mouth\\nwho can take the trouble to drive the vermin away\\n\\nthe eleventh said i gave up my place yesterday i had no fancy for\\ncarrying the heavy books to my master any longer or fetching them away\\nagain there was no end of it all day long but to tell the truth he\\ngave me my dismissal and would not keep me any longer for his\\nclothes which i had left lying in the dust were all motheaten and i\\nam very glad of it\\n\\nthe twelfth said today i had to drive the cart into the country and\\nmade myself a bed of straw on it and had a good sleep the reins\\nslipped out of my hand and when i awoke the horse had nearly torn\\nitself loose the harness was gone the strap which fastened the horse\\nto the shafts was gone and so were the collar the bridle and bit\\nsome one had come by who had carried all off besides this the cart\\nhad got into a quagmire and stuck fast i left it standing and\\nstretched myself on the straw again at last the master came himself\\nand pushed the cart out and if he had not come i should not be lying\\nhere but there and sleeping in full tranquillity',\n",

of the tree would have carried him away\\n\\nafter he had spent some hours in the darkness not without fear and\\ntrembling he saw at a very short distance the glimmer of a light and\\nas he thought

struggle they rushed at\\neach other with such extreme rage that the ground shook with their\\ntrampling and the air resounded with their cries for a long time it\\nwas uncertain which of the two would gain the victory at length the\\nstag thrust his horns into his adversarys body whereupon the bull\\nfell to the earth with a terrific roar and was thoroughly despatched\\nby a few strokes from the stag\\n\\nthe tailor who had watched the fight with astonishment was still\\nstanding there motionless when the stag in full career bounded up to\\nhim and before he could escape caught him up on his great horns he\\nhad not much time to collect his thoughts for it went in a swift race\\nover stock and stone mountain and valley wood and meadow he held\\nwith both hands to the tops of the horns and resigned himself to his\\nfate it seemed however to him just as if he were flying away at\\nlength the stag stopped in front of a wall of rock and gently let the\\ntailor down the tailor more dead than alive required a longer time\\nthan that to come to himself when he had in some degree recovered the\\nstag which had remained standing by him pushed its horns with such\\nforce against a door which was in the rock that it sprang open flames\\nof fire shot forth after which followed a great smoke which hid the\\nstag from his sight the tailor did not know what to do or whither to\\nturn in order to get out of this desert and back to human beings\\nagain whilst he was standing thus undecided a voice sounded out of\\nthe rock which cried to him enter without fear no evil shall befall\\nyou thee he hesitated but driven by a mysterious force he obeyed\\nthe voice and went through the irondoor into a large spacious hall\\nwhose ceiling walls and floor were made of shining polished square\\nstones on each of which were cut letters which were unknown to him he\\nlooked at everything full of admiration and was on the point of going\\nout again when he once more heard the voice which said to him step\\non the stone which lies in the middle of the hall and great good\\nfortune awaits thee\\n\\nhis courage had already grown so great that he obeyed the order the\\nstone began to give way under his feet and sank slowly down into the\\ndepths when it was once more firm and the tailor looked round he\\nfound himself in a hall which in size resembled the former here\\nhowever there was more to look at and to admire hollow places were\\ncut in the walls in which stood vases of transparent glass which were\\nfilled with colored spirit or with a bluish vapour on the floor of the\\nhall two great glass chests stood opposite to each other which at once\\nexcited his curiosity when he went to one of them he saw inside it a\\nhandsome structure like a castle surrounded by farmbuildings stables\\nand barns and a quantity of other good things everything was small\\nbut exceedingly carefully and delicately made and seemed to be cut out\\nby a dexterous hand with the greatest exactitude\\n\\nhe might not have turned away his eyes from the consideration of this\\nrarity for some time if the voice had not once more made itself heard\\nit ordered him to turn round and look at the glass chest which was\\nstanding opposite how his admiration increased when he saw therein a\\nmaiden of the greatest beauty she lay as if asleep and was wrapped in\\nher long fair hair as in a precious mantle her eyes were closely shut\\nbut the brightness of her complexion and a ribbon which her breathing\\nmoved to and fro left no doubt that she was alive the tailor

his lips she said my\\nlongdesired deliverer kind heaven has guided thee to me and put an\\nend to my sorrows on the selfsame day when they end shall thy\\nhappiness begin thou art the husband chosen for me by heaven and\\nshalt pass thy life in unbroken joy loved by me and rich to\\noverflowing in every earthly possession seat thyself and listen to\\nthe story of my life\\n\\ni am the daughter of a rich count my parents died when i was still in\\nmy tender youth and recommended me in their last will to my elder\\nbrother by whom i was brought up we loved each other so tenderly and\\nwere so alike in our way of thinking and our inclinations that we both\\nembraced the resolution never to marry but to stay together to the end\\nof our lives in our house there was no lack of company neighbors and\\nfriends visited us often and we showed the greatest hospitality to\\nevery one so it came to pass one evening that a stranger came riding\\nto our castle and under pretext of not being able to get on to the\\nnext place begged for shelter for the night we granted his request\\nwith ready courtesy and he entertained us in the most agreeable manner\\nduring supper by conversation intermingled with stories my brother\\nliked the stranger so much that he begged him to spend a couple of days\\nwith us to which after some hesitation he consented we did not rise\\nfrom table until late in the night the stranger was shown to room and\\ni hastened as i was tired to lay my limbs in my soft bed hardly had\\ni slept for a short time when the sound of faint and delightful music\\nawoke me as i could not conceive from whence it came i wanted to\\nsummon my waitingmaid who slept in the next room but to my\\nastonishment i found that speech was taken away from me by an unknown\\nforce i felt as if a mountain were weighing down my breast and was\\nunable to make the very slightest sound in the meantime by the light\\nof my nightlamp i saw the stranger enter my room through two doors\\nwhich were fast bolted he came to me and said that by magic arts\\nwhich were at his command he had caused the lovely music to sound in\\norder to awaken me and that he now forced his way through all\\nfastenings with the intention of offering me his hand and heart my\\nrepugnance to his magic arts was however so great that i vouchsafed\\nhim no answer he remained for a time standing without moving\\napparently with the idea of waiting for a favorable decision but as i\\ncontinued to keep silence he angrily declared he would revenge himself\\nand find means to punish my pride and left the room i passed the\\nnight in the greatest disquietude and only fell asleep towards\\nmorning when i awoke i hurried to my brother but did not find him in\\nhis room and the attendants told me that he had ridden forth with the\\nstranger to the chase by daybreak\\n\\ni at once suspected nothing good i dressed myself quickly ordered my\\npalfrey to be saddled and accompanied only by one servant rode full\\ngallop to the forest the servant fell with his horse and could not\\nfollow me for the horse had broken its foot i pursued my way without\\nhalting and in a few minutes i saw the stranger coming towards me with\\na beautiful stag which he led by a cord i asked him where he had left\\nmy brother and how he had come by this stag out of whose great eyes i\\nsaw tears flowing instead of answering me he began to laugh loudly i\\nfell into a great rage at this pulled out a pistol and discharged it\\nat the monster but the ball rebounded from his breast and went into my\\nhorses head i fell to the ground and the stranger muttered some\\nwords which deprived me of consciousness\\n\\nwhen i came to my senses again i found myself in this underground cave\\nin a glass coffin the magician appeared once again and said he had\\nchanged my brother into a stag my castle with all that belonged to it\\ndiminished in size by his arts he had shut up in the other glass\\nchest and my people who were all turned into smoke he had confined\\nin glass bottles he told me that if i would now comply with his wish\\nit was an easy thing for him to put everything back in its former\\nstate as he had nothing to do but open the vessels and everything\\nwould return once more to its natural form i answered him as little as\\ni had done the first time he vanished and left me in my prison in\\nwhich a deep sleep came on me amongst the visions which passed before\\nmy eyes that was the most comforting in which a young man came and set\\nme free and when i opened my eyes today i saw thee and beheld my\\ndream fulfilled help me to accomplish the other things which happened\\nin those visions the first is that we lift the glass chest in which my\\ncastle is enclosed on to that broad stone\\n\\nas soon as the stone was laden it began to rise up on high with the\\nmaiden and the young man and mounted through the opening of the\\nceiling into the upper hall from whence they then could easily reach\\nthe open air here the maiden opened the lid and it was marvellous to\\nbehold how the castle the houses and the farm buildings which were\\nenclosed stretched themselves out and grew to their natural size with\\nthe greatest rapidity after this the maiden and the tailor returned\\nto the cave beneath the earth and had the vessels which were filled\\nwith smoke carried up by the stone the maiden had scarcely opened the\\nbottles when the blue smoke rushed out and changed itself into living\\nmen in whom she recognized her servants and her people her joy was\\nstill more increased when her brother who had killed the magician in\\nthe form of the bull came out of the forest towards them in his human\\nform and on the selfsame day the maiden in accordance with her\\npromise gave her hand at the altar to the lucky tailor',\n",

       " 'there was once upon a time a king but where he reigned and what he was\\ncalled i do not know he had no son but an only daughter who had\\nalways been ill and no doctor had been able to cure

daughter an apple with which she\\ncould eat herself well should have her to wife and be king this\\nbecame known to a peasant who had three sons and he said to the\\neldest go out into the garden and take a basketful of those beautiful\\napples with the red cheeks and carry them to the court perhaps the\\nkings daughter will be able to eat herself well with them and then\\nthou wilt marry her and be king the lad did so and set out\\n\\nwhen he had gone a short way he met a little iron man who asked him\\nwhat he had there in the basket to which replied uele for so was he\\nnamed frogs legs on this the little man said well so shall it\\nbe and remain and went away at length uele arrived at the palace\\nand made it known that he had brought apples which would cure the\\nkings daughter if she ate them this delighted the king hugely and he\\ncaused uele to be brought before him but alas when he opened the\\nbasket instead of having apples in it he had frogs legs which were\\nstill kicking about on this the king grew angry and had him driven\\nout of the house when he got home he told his father how it had fared\\nwith him then the father sent the next son who was called seame but\\nall went with him just as it had gone with uele he also met the little\\niron man who asked what he had there in the basket seame said hogs\\nbristles and the iron man said well so shall it be and remain\\nwhen seame got to the kings palace and said he brought apples with\\nwhich the kings daughter might eat herself well they did not want to\\nlet him go in and said that one fellow had already

the king but when he\\nuncovered the basket he had but hogs bristles this enraged the king\\nmost terribly so he caused seame to be whipped out of the house when\\nhe got home he related all that had befallen him then the youngest\\nboy whose name was hans but who was always called stupid hans came\\nand asked his father if he might go with some apples oh said the\\nfather thou wouldst be just the right fellow for such a thing if the\\nclever ones cant manage it what canst thou do the boy however did\\nnot believe him and said indeed father i wish to go just get\\naway thou stupid fellow thou must wait till thou art wiser said the\\nfather to that and turned his back hans however pulled at the back\\nof his smockfrock and said indeed father i wish to go well\\nthen so far as i am concerned thou mayst go but thou wilt soon come\\nhome again replied the old man in a spiteful voice the boy however\\nwas tremendously delighted and jumped for joy well act like a fool\\nthou growest more stupid every day said the father again hans\\nhowever did not care about that and did not let it spoil his\\npleasure but as it was then night he thought he might as well wait\\nuntil the morrow for he could not get to court that day all night\\nlong he could not sleep in his bed and if he did doze for a moment he\\ndreamt of beautiful maidens of palaces of gold and of silver and\\nall kinds of things of that sort early in the morning he went forth\\non his way and directly afterwards the little shabbylooking man in\\nhis iron clothes came to him and asked what he was carrying in the\\nbasket hans gave him the answer that he was carrying apples with which\\nthe kings daughter was to eat herself well then said the little\\nman so shall they be and remain but at the court they would none\\nof them let hans go in for they said two had already been there who\\nhad told them that they were bringing apples and one of them had\\nfrogs legs and the other hogs bristles hans however resolutely\\nmaintained that he most certainly had no frogs legs but some of the\\nmost beautiful apples in the whole kingdom as he spoke so pleasantly\\nthe doorkeeper thought he could not be telling a lie and asked him to\\ngo in and he was right for when hans uncovered his basket in the\\nkings presence goldenyellow apples came tumbling out the king was\\ndelighted and caused some of them to be taken to his daughter and\\nthen waited in anxious expectation until news should be brought to him\\nof the effect they had but before much time had passed by news was\\nbrought to him but who do you think it was who came it was his\\ndaughter herself as soon as she had eaten of those apples she was\\ncured and sprang out of her bed the joy the king felt cannot be\\ndescribed but now he did not want to give his daughter in marriage to\\nhans and said he must first make him a boat which would go quicker on\\ndry land than on water hans agreed to the conditions and went home\\nand related how it had fared with him then the father sent uele into\\nthe forest to make a boat of that kind he worked diligently and\\nwhistled all the time at midday when the sun was at the highest\\ncame the little iron man and asked what he was making uele gave him\\nfor answer wooden bowls for the kitchen the iron man said so it\\nshall be and remain by evening uele thought he had now made the\\nboat but when he wanted to get into it he had nothing but wooden\\nbowls the next day seame went into the forest but everything went\\nwith him just as it had done with uele on the third day stupid hans\\nwent he worked away most industriously so that the whole forest\\nresounded with the heavy strokes and all the while he sang and\\nwhistled right merrily at midday when it was the hottest the little\\nman came again and asked what he was making a boat which will go\\nquicker on dry land than on the water replied hans and when i have\\nfinished it i am to have the kings daughter for my wife well\\nsaid the little man such an one shall it be and remain in the\\nevening when the sun had turned into gold hans finished his boat and\\nall that was wanted for it he got into it and rowed to the palace the\\nboat went as swiftly as the wind the king saw it from afar but would\\nnot give his daughter to hans yet and said he must first take a\\nhundred hares out to pasture from early morning until late evening and\\nif one of them got away he should not have his daughter hans was\\ncontented with this and the next day went with his flock to the\\npasture and took great care that none of them ran away\\n\\nbefore many hours had passed came a servant from the palace and told\\nhans that he must give her a hare instantly for some visitors had come\\nunexpectedly hans however was very well aware what that meant and\\nsaid he would not give her one the king might set some hare soup\\nbefore his guest next day the maid however would not believe in his\\nrefusal and at last she began to get angry with him then hans said\\nthat if the kings daughter came herself he would give her a hare the\\nmaid told this in the palace and the daughter did go herself in the\\nmeantime however the little man came again to hans and asked him\\nwhat he was doing there he said he had to watch over a hundred hares\\nand see that none of them ran away and then he might marry the kings\\ndaughter and be king good said the little man there is a whistle\\nfor thee and if one of them runs away just whistle with it and then\\nit will come back again when the kings daughter came hans gave her\\na hare into her apron but when she had gone about a hundred steps with\\nit he whistled and the hare jumped out of the apron and before she\\ncould turn round was back to the flock again when the evening came the\\nhareherd whistled once more and looked to see if all were there and\\nthen drove them to the palace the king wondered how hans had been able\\nto take a hundred hares to graze without losing any of them he would\\nhowever not give him his daughter yet and said he must now bring him\\na feather from the griffins tail hans set out at once and walked\\nstraight forwards in the evening he came to a castle and there he\\nasked for a nights lodging for at that time there were no inns the\\nlord of the castle promised him that with much pleasure and asked\\nwhere he was going hans answered to the griffin oh to the\\ngriffin they tell me he knows everything and i have lost the key of\\nan iron moneychest so you might be so good as to ask him where it\\nis yes indeed said hans i will do that early the next morning\\nhe went onwards and on his way arrived at another castle in which he\\nagain stayed the night when the people who lived there learnt that he\\nwas going to the griffin they said they had in the house a daughter\\nwho was ill and that they had already tried every means to cure her\\nbut none of them had done her any good and he might be so kind as to\\nask the griffin what would make their daughter healthy again hans said\\nhe would willingly do that and went onwards then he came to a lake\\nand instead of a ferryboat a tall tall man was there who had to\\ncarry everybody across the man asked hans whither he was journeying\\nto the griffin said hans then when you get to him said the man\\njust ask him why i am forced to carry everybody over the lake yes\\nindeed most certainly ill do that said hans then the man took him\\nup on his shoulders and carried him across at length hans arrived at\\nthe griffins house but the wife only was at home and not the griffin\\nhimself then the woman asked him what he wanted thereupon he told her\\neverything—that he had to get a feather out of the griffins tail and\\nthat there was a castle where they had lost the key of their\\nmoneychest and he was to ask the griffin where it was—that in\\nanother castle the daughter was ill and he was to learn what would\\ncure her—and then not far from thence there was a lake and a man\\nbeside it who was forced to carry people across it and he was very\\nanxious to learn why the man was obliged to do it then said the woman\\nbut look here my good friend no christian can speak to the griffin\\nhe devours them all but if you like you can lie down under his bed\\nand in the night when he is quite fast asleep you can reach out and\\npull a feather out of his tail and as for those things which you are\\nto learn i will ask about them myself hans was quite satisfied with\\nthis and got under the bed in the evening the griffin came home and\\nas soon as he entered the room said wife i smell a christian\\nyes said the woman one was here today but he went away again\\nand on that the griffin said no more\\n\\nin the middle of the night when the griffin was snoring loudly hans\\nreached out and plucked a feather from his tail the griffin woke up\\ninstantly and said wife i smell a christian and it seems to me\\nthat somebody was pulling at my tail his wife said thou hast\\ncertainly been dreaming and i told thee before that a christian was\\nhere today but that he went away again he told me all kinds of\\nthings that in one castle they had lost the key of their moneychest\\nand could find it nowhere oh the fools said the griffin the key\\nlies in the woodhouse under a log of wood behind the door and then\\nhe said that in another castle the daughter was ill and they knew no\\nremedy that would cure her oh the fools said the griffin under\\nthe cellarsteps a toad has made its nest of her hair and if she got\\nher hair back she would be well and then he also said that there was\\na place where there was a lake and a man beside it who was forced to\\ncarry everybody across oh the fool said the griffin if he only\\nput one man down in the middle he would never have to carry another\\nacross early the next morning the griffin got up and went out then\\nhans came forth from under the bed and he had a beautiful feather and\\nhad heard what the griffin had said about the key and the daughter\\nand the ferryman the griffins wife repeated it all once more to him\\nthat he might not forget it and then he went home again first he came\\nto the man by the lake who asked him what the griffin had said but\\nhans replied that he must first carry him across and then he would\\ntell him so the man carried him across and when he was over hans told\\nhim that all he had to do was to set one person down in the middle of\\nthe lake and then he would never have to carry over any more the man\\nwas hugely delighted and told hans that out of gratitude he would take\\nhim once more across and back again but hans said no he would save\\nhim the trouble he was quite satisfied already and pursued his way\\nthen he came to the castle where the daughter was ill he took her on\\nhis shoulders for she could not walk and carried her down the\\ncellarsteps and pulled out the toads nest from beneath the lowest\\nstep and gave it into her hand and she sprang off his shoulder and up\\nthe steps before him and was quite cured then were the father and\\nmother beyond measure rejoiced and they gave hans gifts of gold and of\\nsilver and whatsoever else he wished for that they gave him and when\\nhe got to the other castle he went at once into the woodhouse and\\nfound the key under the log of wood behind the door and took it to the\\nlord of the castle he also was not a little pleased and gave hans as\\na reward much of the gold that was in the chest and all kinds of\\nthings besides such as cows and sheep and goats when hans arrived\\nbefore the king with all these things—with the money and the gold\\nand the silver and the cows sheep and goats the king asked him how he\\nhad come by them then hans told him that the griffin gave every one\\nwhatsoever he wanted so the king thought he himself could make such\\nthings useful and set out on his way to the griffin but when he got\\nto the lake it happened that he was the very first who arrived there\\nafter hans and the man put him down in the middle of it and went away\\nand the king was drowned hans however married the

and at last came into a great cavern which was lighted by a\\nfire which burnt on the hearth on the wall hung swords sabres and\\nother deadly weapons which gleamed in the light and in the midst stood\\na black table at which four other robbers were sitting gambling and\\nthe captain sat at the head of it as soon as he saw the woman he came\\nand spoke to her and told her to be at ease and have no fear they\\nwould do nothing to hurt her but she must look after the\\nhousekeeping and if she kept everything in order she should not fare\\nill with them thereupon they gave her something to eat and showed her\\na bed where she might sleep with her child\\n\\nthe woman stayed many years with the robbers and hans grew tall and\\nstrong his mother told him stories and taught him to read an old book\\nof tales about knights which she found in the cave when hans was nine\\nyears old he made himself a strong club out of a branch of fir hid it\\nbehind the bed and then went to his mother and said dear mother\\npray tell me who is my father i must and will know his mother was\\nsilent and would not tell him that he might not become homesick\\nmoreover she knew that the godless robbers would not let him go away\\nbut it almost broke her heart that hans should not go to his father in\\nthe night when the robbers came home from their robbing expedition\\nhans brought out his club stood before the captain and said i now\\nwish to know who is my father and if thou dost not at once tell me i\\nwill strike thee down then the captain laughed and gave hans such a\\nbox on the ear that he rolled under the table hans got up again held\\nhis tongue and thought i will wait another year and then try again\\nperhaps i shall do better then when the year was over he brought out\\nhis club again rubbed the dust off it looked at it well and said\\nit is a stout strong club at night the robbers came home drank one\\njug of wine after another and their heads began to be heavy then hans\\nbrought out his club placed himself before the captain and asked him\\nwho was his father but the captain again gave him such a vigorous box\\non the ear that hans rolled under the table but it was not long before\\nhe was up again and beat the captain and the robbers so with his club\\nthat they could no longer move either their arms or their legs his\\nmother stood in a corner full of admiration of his bravery and\\nstrength when hans had done his work he went to his mother and said\\nnow i have shown myself to be in earnest but now i must also know who\\nis my father dear hans answered the mother come we will go and\\nseek him until we find him she took from the captain the key to the\\nentrancedoor and hans fetched a great mealsack and packed into it\\ngold and silver and whatsoever else he could find that was beautiful\\nuntil it was full and then he took it on his back they left the cave\\nbut how hans did open his eyes when he came out of the darkness into\\ndaylight and saw the green forest and the flowers and the birds and\\nthe morning sun in the sky he stood there and wondered at everything\\njust as if he had not been very wise his mother looked for the way\\nhome and when they had walked for a couple of hours they got safely\\ninto their lonely valley and to their little house the father was\\nsitting in the doorway he wept for joy when he recognized his wife and\\nheard that hans was his son for he had long regarded them both as\\ndead but hans although he was not twelve years old was a head taller\\nthan his father they went into the little room together but hans had\\nscarcely put his sack on the bench by the stove than the whole house\\nbegan to crack the bench broke down and then the floor and the heavy\\nsack fell through into the cellar god save us cried the father\\nwhats that now thou hast broken our little house to pieces dont\\ngrow any grey hairs about that dear father answered hans there in\\nthat sack is more than is wanting for a new house the father and\\nhans at once began to build a new house to buy cattle and land and to\\nkeep a farm hans ploughed the fields and when he followed the plough\\nand pushed it into the ground the bullocks had scarcely any need to\\ndraw the next spring hans said keep all the money and get a\\nwalkingstick that weighs a hundredweight made for me that i may go\\natravelling when the wishedfor stick was ready he left his\\nfathers house went forth and came to a deep dark forest there he\\nheard something crunching and cracking looked round and saw a\\nfirtree which was wound round like a rope from the bottom to the top\\nand when he looked upwards he saw a great fellow who had laid hold of\\nthe tree and was twisting it like a willowwand hollo cried hans\\nwhat art thou doing up there the fellow replied i got some faggots\\ntogether yesterday and am twisting a rope for them that is what i\\nlike thought hans he has some strength and he called to him\\nleave that alone and come with me the fellow came down and he was\\ntaller by a whole head than hans and hans was not little thy name is\\nnow firtwister said hans to him thereupon they went further and\\nheard something knocking and hammering with such force that the ground\\nshook at every stroke shortly afterwards they came to a mighty rock\\nbefore which a giant was standing and striking great pieces of it away\\nwith his fist when hans asked what he was about he answered at\\nnight when i want to sleep bears wolves and other vermin of that\\nkind come which sniff and snuffle about me and wont let me rest so i\\nwant to build myself a house and lay myself inside it so that i may\\nhave some peace oh indeed thought hans i can make use of this\\none also and said to him leave thy housebuilding alone and go\\nwith me thou shalt be called rocksplitter the man consented and\\nthey all three roamed through the forest and wherever they went the\\nwild beasts were terrified and ran away from them in the evening they\\ncame to an old deserted castle went up into it and laid themselves\\ndown in the hall to sleep the next morning hans went into the garden\\nit had run quite wild and was full of thorns and bushes and as he was\\nthus walking round about a wild boar rushed at him he however gave\\nit such a blow with his club that it fell directly he took it on his\\nshoulders and carried it in and they put it on a spit roasted it and\\nenjoyed themselves then they arranged that each day in turn two\\nshould go out hunting and one should stay at home and cook nine\\npounds of meat for each of them firtwister stayed at home the first\\nand hans and rocksplitter went out hunting when firtwister was busy\\ncooking a little shrivelledup old mannikin came to him in the castle\\nand asked for some meat be off sly hypocrite he answered thou\\nneedest no meat but how astonished firtwister was when the little\\ninsignificant dwarf sprang up at him and belaboured him so with his\\nfists that he could not defend himself but fell on the ground and\\ngasped for breath the dwarf did not go away until he had thoroughly\\nvented his anger on him when the two others came home from hunting\\nfirtwister said nothing to them of the old mannikin and of the blows\\nwhich he himself had received and thought when they stay at home\\nthey may just try their chance with the little scrubbingbrush and\\nthe mere thought of that gave him pleasure already\\n\\nthe next day rocksplitter stayed at home and he fared just as\\nfirtwister had done he was very illtreated by the dwarf because he\\nwas not willing to give him any meat when the others came home in the\\nevening firtwister easily saw what he had suffered but both kept\\nsilence and thought hans also must taste some of that soup\\n\\nhans who had to stay at home the next day did his work in the kitchen\\nas it had to be done and as he was standing skimming the pan the\\ndwarf came and without more ado demanded a bit of meat then hans\\nthought he is a poor wretch i will give him some of my share that\\nthe others may not run short and handed him a bit when the dwarf had\\ndevoured it he again asked for some meat and goodnatured hans gave\\nit to him and told him it was a handsome piece and that he was to be\\ncontent with it but the dwarf begged again for the third time thou\\nart shameless said hans and gave him none then the malicious dwarf\\nwanted to spring on him and treat him as he had treated firtwister and\\nrocksplitter but he had got to the wrong man hans without exerting\\nhimself much gave him a couple of blows which made him jump down the\\ncastle steps hans was about to run after him but fell right over him\\nfor he was so tall when he rose up again the dwarf had got the start\\nof him hans hurried after him as far as the forest and saw him slip\\ninto a hole in the rock hans now went home but he had marked the\\nspot when the two others came back they were surprised that hans was\\nso well he told them what had happened and then they no longer\\nconcealed how it had fared with them hans laughed and said it served\\nyou quite right why were you so greedy with your meat it is a\\ndisgrace that you who are so big should have let yourselves be beaten\\nby the dwarf thereupon they took a basket and a rope and all three\\nwent to the hole in the rock into which the dwarf had slipped and let\\nhans and his club down in the basket when hans had reached the bottom\\nhe found a door and when he opened it a maiden was sitting there who\\nwas lovely as any picture nay so beautiful that no words can express\\nit and by her side sat the dwarf and grinned at hans like a seacat\\nshe however was bound with chains and looked so mournfully at him\\nthat hans felt great pity for her and thought to himself thou must\\ndeliver her out of the power of the wicked dwarf and gave him such a\\nblow with his club that he fell down dead immediately the chains fell\\nfrom the maiden and hans was enraptured with her beauty she told him\\nshe was a kings daughter whom a savage count had stolen away from her\\nhome and imprisoned there among the rocks because she would have\\nnothing to say to him the count had however set the dwarf as a\\nwatchman and he had made her bear misery and vexation enough and now\\nhans placed the maiden in the basket and had her drawn up the basket\\ncame down again but hans did not trust his two companions and\\nthought they have already shown themselves to be false and told me\\nnothing about the dwarf who knows what design they may have against\\nme so he put his club in the basket and it was lucky he did for\\nwhen the basket was halfway up they let it fall again and if hans\\nhad really been sitting in it he would have been killed but now he did\\nnot know how he was to work his way out of the depths and when he\\nturned it over and over in his mind he found no counsel it is indeed\\nsad said he to himself that i have to waste away down here and as\\nhe was thus walking backwards and forwards he once more came to the\\nlittle chamber where the maiden had been sitting and saw that the\\ndwarf had a ring on his finger which shone and sparkled then he drew\\nit off and put it on and when he turned it round on his finger he\\nsuddenly heard something rustle over his head he looked up and saw\\nspirits of the air hovering above who told him he was their master\\nand asked what his desire might be hans was at first struck dumb but\\nafterwards he said that they were to carry him above again they obeyed\\ninstantly and it was just as if he had flown up himself when\\nhowever he was above again he found no one in sight firtwister and\\nrocksplitter had hurried away and had taken the beautiful maiden with\\nthem but hans turned the ring and the spirits of the air came and\\ntold him that the two were on the sea hans ran and ran without\\nstopping until he came to the seashore and there far far out on the\\nwater he perceived a little boat in which his faithless comrades were\\nsitting and in fierce anger he leapt without thinking what he was\\ndoing club in hand into the water and began to swim but the club\\nwhich weighed a hundredweight dragged him deep down until he was all\\nbut drowned then in the very nick of time he turned his ring and\\nimmediately the spirits of the air came and bore him as swift as\\nlightning into the boat he swung his club and gave his wicked comrades\\nthe reward they merited and threw them into the water and then he\\nsailed with the beautiful maiden who had been in the greatest alarm\\nand whom he delivered for the second time home to her father and\\nmother and married her and all rejoiced exceedingly',\n",

shut one eye and with the other looked\\nstraight at the mousehole the little fellow put his head out and\\npeeped and wanted to slip away but the owl came forward immediately\\nand he drew his head

for nothing it ought to have gravel in it not sand i shall\\nlive to see that house tumble down on the people who are in it he sat\\ndown put a couple of stitches in and then jumped up again

lengthways but obliquely did any\\none ever see such a piece of stupidity thought master pfriem but he\\nsaid nothing and seemed satisfied with it it comes to the same thing\\nafter all whichever way they carry the beam straight or crooked if\\nthey only get along with it and truly i do not see them knock against\\nanything soon after this he saw two angels who were drawing water out\\nof a well into a bucket but at the same time he observed that the\\nbucket was full of holes and that the water was running out of it on\\nevery side they were watering the earth with rain hang it

as i\\nhave already noticed do nothing but idle about he went farther and\\nsaw a cart which had stuck fast in a deep hole its no wonder said\\nhe to the man who stood by it who would load so unreasonably what\\nhave you there good wishes replied the man i could not go along\\nthe right way with it but still i have pushed it safely up here and\\nthey wont leave me sticking here in fact an angel did come and\\nharnessed two horses to it thats quite right thought pfriem but\\ntwo horses wont get that cart out it must at least have four to it\\nanother angel came and brought two more

and pushed him forth with\\nirresistible strength beneath the gateway master pfriem turned his\\nhead round to take one more look at the cart and saw that it was being\\nraised into the air by four winged horses\\n\\nat this moment master pfriem awoke things are certainly arranged in\\nheaven otherwise than they are on earth said he to himself and that\\nexcuses much but who can see horses

heard that he\\nfell into a passion and said if thou lovest me like salt thy love\\nshall also be repaid thee with salt then he divided the kingdom\\nbetween the two elder but caused a sack of salt to be bound on the\\nback of the youngest and two servants had to lead her forth into the\\nwild forest we all begged and prayed for her said the queen but the\\nkings anger was not to be appeased how she cried when she had to\\nleave us the whole road was strewn with the pearls which flowed from\\nher eyes the king soon afterwards repented of his great severity and\\nhad the whole forest searched for the poor child but no one could find\\nher when i think that the wild beasts have devoured her i know not\\nhow to contain myself for sorrow many a time i console myself with the\\nhope that she is still alive and may have hidden herself in a cave or\\nhas found shelter with compassionate people but picture to yourself\\nwhen i opened your little emerald book a pearl lay therein of exactly\\nthe same kind as those which used to fall from my daughters eyes and\\nthen you can also imagine how the sight of it stirred my heart you\\nmust tell me how you came by that pearl the count told her that he\\nhad received it from the old woman in the forest who had appeared very\\nstrange to him and must be a witch but he had neither seen nor hear\\nanything of the queens child the king and the queen resolved to seek\\nout the old woman they thought that there where the pearl had been\\nthey would obtain news of their daughter\\n\\nthe old woman was sitting in that lonely place at her spinningwheel\\nspinning it was already dusk and a log which was burning on the\\nhearth gave a scanty light all at once there was a noise outside the\\ngeese were coming home from the pasture and uttering their hoarse\\ncries soon afterwards the daughter also entered but the old woman\\nscarcely thanked her and only shook her head a little the daughter\\nsat down beside her took her spinningwheel and twisted the threads\\nas nimbly as a young girl thus they both sat for two hours and\\nexchanged never a word at last something rustled at the window and\\ntwo fiery eyes peered in it was an old nightowl which cried uhu\\nthree times the old woman looked up just a little then she said\\nnow my little daughter it is time for thee to go out and do thy\\nwork she rose and went out and where did she go over the meadows\\never onward into the valley at last she came to a well with three old\\noaktrees standing beside it meanwhile the moon had risen large and\\nround over the mountain and it was so light that one could have found\\na needle she removed a skin which covered her face then bent down to\\nthe well and began to wash herself when she had finished she dipped\\nthe skin also in the water and then laid it on the meadow so that it\\nshould bleach in the moonlight and dry again but how the maiden was\\nchanged such a change as that was never seen before when the gray\\nmask fell off her golden hair broke forth like sunbeams and spread\\nabout like a mantle over her whole form her eyes shone out as brightly\\nas the stars in heaven and her cheeks bloomed a soft red like\\nappleblossom\\n\\nbut the fair maiden was sad she sat down and wept bitterly one tear\\nafter another forced itself out of her eyes and rolled through her\\nlong hair to the ground there she sat and would have remained sitting\\na long time if there had not been a rustling and cracking in the\\nboughs of the neighbouring tree she sprang up like a roe which has\\nbeen overtaken by the shot of the hunter just then the moon was\\nobscured by a dark cloud and in an instant the maiden had put on the\\nold skin and vanished like a light blown out by the wind\\n\\nshe ran back home trembling like an aspenleaf the old woman was\\nstanding on the threshold and the girl was about to relate what had\\nbefallen her but the old woman laughed kindly and said i already\\nknow all she led her into the room and lighted a new log she did\\nnot however sit down to her spinning again but fetched a broom and\\nbegan to sweep and scour all must be clean and sweet she said to\\nthe girl but mother said the maiden why do you begin work at so\\nlate an hour what do you expect dost thou know then what time it\\nis asked the old woman not yet midnight answered the maiden but\\nalready past eleven oclock dost thou not remember continued the\\nold woman that it is three years today since thou camest to me thy\\ntime is up we can no longer remain together the girl was terrified\\nand said alas dear mother will you cast me off where shall i go i\\nhave no friends and no home to which i can go i have always done as\\nyou bade me and you have always been satisfied with me do not send me\\naway the old woman would not tell the maiden what lay before her my\\nstay here is over she said to her but when i depart house and\\nparlour must be clean therefore do not hinder me in my work have no\\ncare for thyself thou shalt find a roof to shelter thee and the wages\\nwhich i will give thee shall also content thee but tell me what is\\nabout to happen the maiden continued to entreat i tell thee again\\ndo not hinder me in my work do not say a word more go to thy chamber\\ntake the skin off thy face and put on the silken gown which thou hadst\\non when thou camest to me and then wait in thy chamber until i call\\nthee\\n\\nbut i must once more tell of the king and queen who had journeyed\\nforth with the count in order to seek out the old woman in the\\nwilderness the count had strayed away from them in the wood by night\\nand had to walk onwards alone next day it seemed to him that he was on\\nthe right track he still went forward until darkness came on then he\\nclimbed a tree intending to pass the night there for he feared that\\nhe might lose his way when the moon illumined the surrounding country\\nhe perceived a figure coming down the mountain she had no stick in her\\nhand but yet he could see that it was the goosegirl whom he had seen\\nbefore in the house of the old woman oho cried he there she\\ncomes and if i once get hold of one of the witches the other shall\\nnot escape me but how astonished he was when she went to the well\\ntook off the skin and washed herself when her golden hair fell down\\nall about her and she was more beautiful than any one whom he had ever\\nseen in the whole world he hardly dared to breathe but stretched his\\nhead as far forward through the leaves as he dared and stared at her\\neither he bent over too far or whatever the cause might be the bough\\nsuddenly cracked and that very moment the maiden slipped into the\\nskin sprang away like a roe and as the moon was suddenly covered\\ndisappeared from his eyes hardly had she disappeared before the count\\ndescended from the tree and hastened after her with nimble steps he\\nhad not been gone long before he saw in the twilight two figures\\ncoming over the meadow it was the king and queen who had perceived\\nfrom a distance the light shining in the old womans little house and\\nwere going to it the count told them what wonderful things he had seen\\nby the well and they did not doubt that it had been their lost\\ndaughter they walked onwards full of joy and soon came to the little\\nhouse the geese were sitting all round it and had thrust their heads\\nunder their wings and were sleeping and not one of them moved the\\nking and queen looked in at the window the old woman was sitting there\\nquite quietly spinning nodding her head and never looking round the\\nroom was perfectly clean as if the little mist men who carry no dust\\non their feet lived there their daughter however they did not see\\nthey gazed at all this for a long time at last they took heart and\\nknocked softly at the window the old woman appeared to have been\\nexpecting them she rose and called out quite kindly come in—i know\\nyou already when they had entered the room the old woman said you\\nmight have spared yourself the long walk if you had not three years\\nago unjustly driven away your child who is so good and lovable no\\nharm has come to her for three years she has had to tend the geese\\nwith them she has learnt no evil but has preserved her purity of\\nheart you however have been sufficiently punished by the misery in\\nwhich you have lived then she went to the chamber and called come\\nout my little daughter thereupon the door opened and the princess\\nstepped out in her silken garments with her golden hair and her\\nshining eyes and it was as if an angel from heaven had entered\\n\\nshe went up to her father and mother fell on their necks and kissed\\nthem there was no help for it they all had to weep for joy the young\\ncount stood near them and when she perceived him she became as red in\\nthe face as a mossrose she herself did not know why the king said\\nmy dear child i have given away my kingdom what shall i give thee\\nshe needs nothing said the old woman i give her the tears that she\\nhas wept on your account they are precious pearls finer than those\\nthat are found in the sea and worth more than your whole kingdom and\\ni give her my little house as payment for her services when the old\\nwoman had said that she disappeared from their sight the walls\\nrattled a little and when the king and queen looked round the little\\nhouse had changed into a splendid palace a royal table had been\\nspread and the servants were running hither and thither\\n\\nthe story goes still further but my grandmother who related it to me\\nhad partly lost her memory and had forgotten the rest i shall always\\nbelieve that the beautiful princess married the count and that they\\nremained together in the palace and lived there in all happiness so\\nlong as god willed it whether the snowwhite geese which were kept\\nnear the little hut were verily young maidens no one need take\\noffence whom the old woman had taken under her protection and\\nwhether they now received their human form again and stayed as\\nhandmaids to the young queen i do not exactly know but i suspect it\\nthis much is certain that the old woman was no witch as people\\nthought but a wise woman who meant well very likely it was she who\\nat the princesss birth gave her the gift of weeping pearls instead of\\ntears that does not happen nowadays or else the poor would soon\\nbecome rich',\n",

       " 'there was once upon a time a miller who lived with his wife in great\\ncontentment they had money and land and their prosperity increased\\nyear by year more and more but illluck comes like

when he lay down after\\nhis days work found no rest but tossed about in his bed full of\\ncare one morning he rose before daybreak and went out into the open\\nair thinking that perhaps there his heart might become lighter as he\\nwas stepping over the milldam the first sunbeam was just breaking\\nforth and he heard a rippling sound in the pond he turned round and\\nperceived a beautiful woman rising slowly out of the water her long\\nhair which she was holding off her shoulders with her soft hands fell\\ndown on both sides and covered her white body he soon saw that she\\nwas the nix of the millpond and in his fright did not know whether he\\nshould run away or stay where he was but the nix made her sweet voice\\nheard called him by his name and asked him why he was so sad the\\nmiller was at first struck dumb but when he heard her speak so kindly\\nhe took heart and told her how he had formerly lived in wealth and\\nhappiness but that now he was so poor that he did not know what to do\\nbe easy answered the nix i will make thee richer and happier than\\nthou hast ever been before only thou must promise to give me the young\\nthing which has just been born in thy house what else can that be\\nthought the miller but a young puppy or kitten and he promised her\\nwhat she desired the nix descended into the water again and he\\nhurried back to his mill consoled and in good spirits he had not yet\\nreached it when the maidservant came out of the house and cried to\\nhim to rejoice for his wife had given birth to a little boy the\\nmiller stood as if struck by

the village took him into his\\nservice in the village lived a beautiful and truehearted maiden who\\npleased the huntsman and when his master perceived that he gave him a\\nlittle house the two were married lived peacefully and happily and\\nloved each other with all their hearts\\n\\none day the huntsman was chasing a roe and when the animal turned\\naside from the forest into the open country he pursued it and at last\\nshot it he did not notice that he was now in the neighbourhood of the\\ndangerous millpond and went after he had disembowelled the stag to\\nthe water in order to wash his

it was evening and the huntsman did not\\nreturn home his wife became alarmed she went out to seek him and as\\nhe had often told her that he had to be on his guard against the snares\\nof the nix and dared not venture into the neighbourhood of the\\nmillpond she already suspected what had happened she hastened to the\\nwater and when she found his huntingpouch lying on the shore she\\ncould no longer have any doubt of the misfortune lamenting her sorrow\\nand wringing her hands she called on her beloved by name but in vain\\nshe hurried across to the other side of the pond and called him anew\\nshe reviled the nix with harsh words but no answer followed the\\nsurface of the water remained calm only the crescent moon stared\\nsteadily back at her the poor woman did not leave the pond with hasty\\nsteps she paced round and round it without resting a moment\\nsometimes in silence sometimes uttering a loud cry sometimes softly\\nsobbing at last her strength came to an end she sank down to the\\nground and fell into a heavy sleep presently a dream took possession\\nof her she was anxiously climbing upwards between great masses of\\nrock thorns and briars caught her feet the rain beat in her face and\\nthe wind tossed her long hair about when she had reached the summit\\nquite a different sight presented itself to her the sky was blue the\\nair soft the ground sloped gently downwards and on a green meadow\\ngay with flowers of every colour stood a pretty cottage she went up\\nto it and opened the door there sat an old woman with white hair who\\nbeckoned to her kindly at that very moment the poor woman awoke day\\nhad already dawned and she at once resolved to act in accordance with\\nher dream she laboriously climbed the mountain everything was exactly\\nas she had seen it in the night the old woman received her kindly and\\npointed out a chair on which she might sit thou must have met with a\\nmisfortune she said since thou hast sought out my lonely cottage\\nwith tears the woman related what had befallen her be comforted\\nsaid the old woman i will help thee here is a golden comb for thee\\ntarry till the full moon has risen then go to the millpond seat\\nthyself on the shore and comb thy long black hair with this comb when\\nthou hast done lay it down on the bank and thou wilt see what will\\nhappen the woman returned home but the time till the full moon came\\npassed slowly at last the shining disc appeared in the heavens then\\nshe went out to the millpond sat down and combed her long black hair\\nwith the golden comb and when she had finished she laid it down at\\nthe waters edge it was not long before there was a movement in the\\ndepths a wave rose rolled to the shore and bore the comb away with\\nit in not more than the time necessary for the comb to sink to the\\nbottom the surface of the water parted and the head of the huntsman\\narose he did not speak but looked at his wife with sorrowful glances\\nat the same instant a second wave came rushing up and covered the\\nmans head all had vanished the millpond lay peaceful as before and\\nnothing but the face of the full moon shone on it full of sorrow the\\nwoman went back but again the dream showed her the cottage of the old\\nwoman next morning she again set out and complained of her woes to the\\nwise woman the old woman gave her a golden flute and said tarry\\ntill the full moon comes again then take this flute play a beautiful\\nair on it and when thou hast finished lay it on the sand then thou\\nwilt see what will happen the wife did as the old woman told her no\\nsooner was the flute lying on the sand than there was a stirring in the\\ndepths and a wave rushed up and bore the flute away with it\\nimmediately afterwards the water parted and not only the head of the\\nman but half of his body also arose he stretched out his arms\\nlongingly towards her but a second wave came up covered him and drew\\nhim down again alas what does it profit me said the unhappy woman\\nthat i should see my beloved only to lose him again despair filled\\nher heart anew but the dream led her a third time to the house of the\\nold woman she set out and the wise woman gave her a golden\\nspinningwheel consoled her and said all is not yet fulfilled tarry\\nuntil the time of the full moon then take the spinningwheel seat\\nthyself on the shore and spin the spool full and when thou hast done\\nthat place the spinningwheel near the water and thou wilt see what\\nwill happen the woman obeyed all she said exactly as soon as the\\nfull moon showed itself she carried the golden spinningwheel to the\\nshore and span industriously until the flax came to an end and the\\nspool was quite filled with the threads no sooner was the wheel\\nstanding on the shore than there was a more violent movement than\\nbefore in the depths of the pond and a mighty wave rushed up and bore\\nthe wheel away with it immediately the head and the whole body of the\\nman rose into the air in a waterspout he quickly sprang to the\\nshore caught his wife by the hand and fled but they had scarcely gone\\na very little distance when the whole pond rose with a frightful roar\\nand streamed out over the open country the fugitives already saw death\\nbefore their eyes when the woman in her terror implored the help of\\nthe old woman and in an instant they were transformed she into a\\ntoad he into a frog the flood which had overtaken them could not\\ndestroy them but it tore them apart and carried them far away when\\nthe water had dispersed and they both touched dry land again they\\nregained their human form but neither knew where the other was they\\nfound themselves among strange people who did not know their native\\nland high mountains and deep valleys lay between them in order to\\nkeep themselves alive they were both obliged to tend sheep for many\\nlong years they drove their flocks through field and forest and were\\nfull of sorrow and longing when spring had once more broken forth on\\nthe earth they both went out one day with their flocks and as chance\\nwould have it they drew near each other they met in a valley but did\\nnot recognize each other yet they rejoiced that they were no longer so\\nlonely henceforth they each day drove their flocks to the same place\\nthey did not speak much but they felt comforted one evening when the\\nfull moon was shining in the sky and the sheep were already at rest\\nthe shepherd pulled the flute out of his pocket and played on it a\\nbeautiful but sorrowful air when he had finished he saw that the\\nshepherdess was weeping bitterly why art thou weeping he asked\\nalas answered she thus shone the full moon when i played this air\\non the flute for the last time and the head of my beloved rose out of\\nthe water he looked at her and it seemed as if a veil fell from his\\neyes and he recognized his dear wife and when she looked at him and\\nthe moon shone in his face she knew him also they embraced and kissed\\neach other and no one need ask if they were happy',\n",
       " 'a tailor and a goldsmith were travelling together and one evening when\\nthe sun had sunk behind the mountains they heard the sound of distant\\nmusic which became more and more distinct it sounded strange but so\\npleasant that they forgot all their weariness and stepped quickly\\nonwards the moon had already arisen when they reached a hill on which\\nthey saw a crowd of little men and women who had taken each others\\nhands and were whirling round in the dance with the greatest pleasure\\nand delight\\n\\nthey sang to it most charmingly and that was the music which the\\ntravellers had heard in the midst of them sat an old man who was\\nrather taller than the rest he wore a particoloured coat and his\\nirongrey beard hung down over his breast the two remained standing\\nfull of astonishment and watched the dance the old man made a sign\\nthat they should enter and the little folks willingly opened their\\ncircle the goldsmith who had a hump and like all hunchbacks was\\nbrave enough stepped in the tailor felt a little afraid at first and\\nheld back but when he saw how merrily all was going he plucked up his\\ncourage and followed the circle closed again directly and the little\\nfolks went on singing and dancing with the wildest leaps the old man\\nhowever took a large knife which hung to his girdle whetted it and\\nwhen it was sufficiently sharpened he looked round at the strangers\\nthey were terrified but they had not much time for reflection for the\\nold man seized the goldsmith and with the greatest speed shaved the\\nhair of his head clean off and then the same thing happened to the\\ntailor but their fear left them when after he had finished his work\\nthe old man clapped them both on the shoulder in a friendly manner as\\nmuch as to say they had behaved well to let all that be done to them\\nwillingly and without any struggle he pointed with his finger to a\\nheap of coals which lay at one side and signified to the travellers by\\nhis gestures that they were to fill their pockets with them both of\\nthem obeyed although they did not know of what use the coals would be\\nto them and then they went on their way to seek a shelter for the\\nnight when they had got into the valley the clock of the neighbouring\\nmonastery struck twelve and the song ceased in a moment all had\\nvanished and the hill lay in solitude in the moonlight\\n\\nthe two travellers found an inn and covered themselves up on their\\nstrawbeds with their coats but in their weariness forgot to take the\\ncoals out of them before doing so a heavy weight on their limbs\\nawakened them earlier than usual they felt in the pockets and could\\nnot believe their eyes when they saw that they were not filled with\\ncoals but with pure gold happily too the hair of their heads and\\nbeards was there again as thick as ever\\n\\nthey had now become rich folks but the goldsmith who in accordance\\nwith his greedy disposition had filled his pockets better was as rich\\nagain as the tailor a greedy man even if he has much still wishes to\\nhave more so the goldsmith proposed to the tailor that they should\\nwait another day and go out again in the evening in order to bring\\nback still greater treasures from the old man on the hill the tailor\\nrefused and said i have enough and am content now i shall be a\\nmaster and marry my dear object for so he called his sweetheart and\\ni am a happy man but he stayed another day to please him in the\\nevening the goldsmith hung a couple of bags over his shoulders that he\\nmight be able to stow away a great deal and took the road to the hill\\nhe found as on the night before the little folks at their singing and\\ndancing and the old man again shaved him clean and signed to him to\\ntake some coal away with him he was not slow about sticking as much\\ninto his bags as would go went back quite delighted and covered\\nhimself over with his coat even if the gold does weigh heavily said\\nhe i will gladly bear that and at last he fell asleep with the\\nsweet anticipation of waking in the morning an enormously rich man\\n\\nwhen he opened his eyes he got up in haste to examine his pockets but\\nhow amazed he was when he drew nothing out of them but black coals and\\nthat howsoever often he put his hands in them the gold i got the\\nnight before is still there for me thought he and went and brought\\nit out but how shocked he was when he saw that it likewise had again\\nturned into coal he smote his forehead with his dusty black hand and\\nthen he felt that his whole head was bald and smooth as was also the\\nplace where his beard should have been but his misfortunes were not\\nyet over he now remarked for the first time that in addition to the\\nhump on his back a second just as large had grown in front on his\\nbreast then he recognized the punishment of his greediness and began\\nto weep aloud the good tailor who was wakened by this comforted the\\nunhappy fellow as well as he could and said thou hast been my\\ncomrade in my travelling time thou shalt stay with me and share in my\\nwealth he kept his word but the poor goldsmith was obliged to

       " 'this story my dear young folks seems to be false but it really is\\ntrue for my grandfather from whom i have it used always when\\nrelating it to say complacently it must be true my son or else no\\none could tell it to you the story is as follows one sunday morning\\nabout harvest time just as the buckwheat was in bloom the sun was\\nshining brightly in heaven the east wind was blowing warmly over the\\nstubblefields the larks were singing in the air the bees buzzing\\namong the buckwheat the people were all going in their sunday clothes\\nto church and all creatures were happy and the hedgehog was happy\\ntoo\\n\\nthe hedgehog however was standing by his door with his arms akimbo\\nenjoying the morning breezes and slowly trilling a little song to\\nhimself which was neither better nor worse than the songs which\\nhedgehogs are in the habit of singing on a blessed sunday morning\\nwhilst he was thus singing half aloud to himself it suddenly occurred\\nto him that while his wife was washing and drying the children he\\nmight very well take a walk into the field and see how his turnips\\nwere going on the turnips were in fact close beside his house and\\nhe and his family were accustomed to eat them for which reason he\\nlooked upon them as his own no sooner said than done the hedgehog\\nshut the housedoor behind him and took the path to the field he had\\nnot gone very far from home and was just turning round the sloebush\\nwhich stands there outside the field to go up into the turnipfield\\nwhen he observed the hare who had gone out on business of the same\\nkind namely to visit his cabbages when the hedgehog caught sight of\\nthe hare he bade him a friendly good morning but the hare who was in\\nhis own way a distinguished gentleman and frightfully haughty did not\\nreturn the hedgehogs greeting but said to him assuming at the same\\ntime a very contemptuous manner how do you happen to be running about\\nhere in the field so early in the morning i am taking a walk said\\nthe hedgehog a walk said the hare with a smile it seems to me\\nthat you might use your legs for a better purpose this answer made\\nthe hedgehog furiously angry for he can bear anything but an attack on\\nhis legs just because they are crooked by nature so now the hedgehog\\nsaid to the hare you seem to imagine that you can do more with your\\nlegs than i with mine that is just what i do think said the hare\\nthat can be put to the test said the hedgehog i wager that if we\\nrun a race i will outstrip you that is ridiculous you with your\\nshort legs said the hare but for my part i am willing if you have\\nsuch a monstrous fancy for it what shall we wager a golden\\nlouisdor and a bottle of brandy said the hedgehog done said the\\nhare shake hands on it and then we may as well come off at once\\nnay said the hedgehog there is no such great hurry i am still\\nfasting i will go home first and have a little breakfast in\\nhalfanhour i will be back again at this place\\n\\nhereupon the hedgehog departed for the hare was quite satisfied with\\nthis on his way the hedgehog thought to himself the hare relies on\\nhis long legs but i will contrive to get the better of him he may be\\na great man but he is a very silly fellow and he shall pay for what\\nhe has said so when the hedgehog reached home he said to his wife\\nwife dress thyself quickly thou must go out to the field with me\\nwhat is going on then said his wife i have made a wager with the\\nhare for a gold louisdor and a bottle of brandy i am to run a race\\nwith him and thou must be present good heavens husband the wife\\nnow cried art thou not right in thy mind hast thou completely lost\\nthy wits what can make thee want to run a race with the hare hold\\nthy tongue woman said the hedgehog that is my affair dont begin\\nto discuss things which are matters for men be off dress thyself and\\ncome with me what could the hedgehogs wife do she was forced to\\nobey him whether she liked it or not\\n\\nso when they had set out on their way together the hedgehog said to\\nhis wife now pay attention to what i am going to say look you i\\nwill make the long field our racecourse the hare shall run in one\\nfurrow and i in another and we will begin to run from the top now\\nall that thou hast to do is to place thyself here below in the furrow\\nand when the hare arrives at the end of the furrow on the other side\\nof thee thou must cry out to him i am here already\\n\\nthen they reached the field and the hedgehog showed his wife her\\nplace and then walked up the field when he reached the top the hare\\nwas already there shall we start said the hare certainly said\\nthe hedgehog then both at once so saying each placed himself in\\nhis own furrow the hare counted once twice thrice and away and\\nwent off like a whirlwind down the field the hedgehog however only\\nran about three paces and then he stooped down in the furrow and\\nstayed quietly where he was when the hare therefore arrived in full\\ncareer at the lower end of the field the hedgehogs wife met him with\\nthe cry i am here already the hare was shocked and wondered not a\\nlittle he thought no other than that it was the hedgehog himself who\\nwas calling to him for the hedgehogs wife looked just like her\\nhusband the hare however thought to himself that has not been done\\nfairly and cried it must be run again let us have it again and\\nonce more he went off like the wind in a storm so that he seemed to\\nfly but the hedgehogs wife stayed quietly in her place so when the\\nhare reached the top of the field the hedgehog himself cried out to\\nhim i am here already the hare however quite beside himself with\\nanger cried it must be run again we must have it again all\\nright answered the hedgehog for my part well run as often as you\\nchoose so the hare ran seventythree times more and the hedgehog\\nalways held out against him and every time the hare reached either the\\ntop or the bottom either the hedgehog or his wife said i am here\\nalready\\n\\nat the seventyfourth time however the hare could no longer reach the\\nend in the middle of the field he fell to the ground blood streamed\\nout of his mouth and he lay dead on the spot but the hedgehog took\\nthe louisdor which he had won and the bottle of brandy called his\\nwife out of the furrow and both went home together in great delight\\nand if they are not dead they are living there still\\n\\nthis is how it happened that the hedgehog made the hare run races with\\nhim on the buxtehuder heath till he died and since that time no hare\\nhas ever had any fancy for running races with a buxtehuder hedgehog\\n\\nthe moral of this story however is firstly that no one however\\ngreat he may be should permit himself to jest at any one beneath him\\neven if he be only a hedgehog and secondly it teaches that when a\\nman marries he should take a wife in his own position who looks just\\nas he himself looks so whosoever is a hedgehog let him see to it that\\nhis wife is a hedgehog also and so forth',\n",

they first\\nnamed the richest the poorest they said was the girl who lived in\\nthe small house quite at the end of the village the rich girl was\\nsitting in all her splendour before the door of her house and when the\\nprince approached her she got up went to meet him and made him a low\\ncurtsey he looked at her said nothing and rode on when he came to\\nthe house of the poor girl she was not standing at the door but\\nsitting in her little room he stopped his horse and saw through the\\nwindow on which the bright sun was shining the girl sitting at her\\nspinningwheel busily spinning she looked up and when she saw that\\nthe prince was looking in she blushed all over her face let her eyes\\nfall and went on spinning i do not know whether just at that moment\\nthe thread was quite even but she went on spinning until the kings\\nson had ridden away again then she went to the window opened it and\\nsaid it is so warm in this room but she still looked after him as\\nlong as she could distinguish the white feathers in his hat then she\\nsat down to work again in her own room and went on with her spinning\\nand a saying which the old woman had often repeated when she was\\nsitting at her work came into her mind and she sang these words to\\nherself—\\n\\nspindle my spindle haste haste thee away\\nand here to my house bring the wooer i pray\\n\\n\\nand what do you think happened the spindle sprang out of her hand in\\nan instant and out of the door and when in her astonishment she got\\nup and looked after it she saw that it was dancing out merrily into\\nthe open country and drawing a shining golden thread after it before\\nlong it had entirely vanished from her sight as she had now no\\nspindle the girl took the weavers shuttle in her hand sat down to\\nher loom and began to weave\\n\\nthe spindle however danced continually onwards and just as the\\nthread came to an end reached the prince what do i see he cried\\nthe spindle certainly wants to show me the way turned his horse\\nabout and rode back with the golden thread the girl was however\\nsitting at her work singing\\n\\nshuttle my shuttle weave well this day\\nand guide the wooer to me i pray\\n\\n\\nimmediately the shuttle sprang out of her hand and out by the door\\nbefore the threshold however it began to weave a carpet which was\\nmore beautiful than the eyes of man had ever yet beheld lilies and\\nroses blossomed on both sides of it and on a golden ground in the\\ncentre green branches ascended under which bounded hares and rabbits\\nstags and deer stretched their heads in between them brightlycoloured\\nbirds were sitting in the branches above they lacked nothing but the\\ngift of song the shuttle leapt hither and thither and everything\\nseemed to grow of its own accord\\n\\nas the shuttle had run away the girl sat down to sew she held the\\nneedle in her hand and sang\\n\\nneedle my needle sharppointed and fine\\nprepare for a wooer this house of mine\\n\\n\\nthen the needle leapt out of her fingers and flew everywhere about the\\nroom as quick as lightning it was just as if invisible spirits were\\nworking they covered tables and benches with green cloth in an\\ninstant and the chairs with velvet and hung the windows with silken\\ncurtains hardly had the needle put in the last stitch than the maiden\\nsaw through the window the white feathers of the prince whom the\\nspindle had brought thither by the golden thread he alighted stepped\\nover the carpet into the house and when he entered the room there\\nstood the maiden in her poor garments but she shone out from within\\nthem like a rose surrounded by leaves thou art the poorest and also\\nthe richest said he to her come with me thou shalt be my bride\\nshe did not speak but she gave him her hand then he gave her a kiss\\nled her forth lifted her on to his horse and took her to the royal\\ncastle where the wedding was solemnized with great rejoicings the\\nspindle shuttle and needle were preserved in the treasurechamber\\nand held in great honour',\n",

       " 'one day an old man and his wife were sitting in front of a miserable\\nhouse resting a while from their work suddenly a splendid carriage\\nwith four black horses came driving up and a richlydressed man\\ndescended from it the peasant stood up went to the great man and\\nasked what he wanted and in what way he could be useful to him the\\nstranger stretched out his hand to the old man and said i want\\nnothing but to enjoy for once a country dish cook me some potatoes in\\nthe way you always have them and then i will sit down at your table\\nand eat them with pleasure the peasant smiled and said you are a\\ncount or a prince or perhaps even a duke noble gentlemen often have\\nsuch fancies but you shall have your wish the wife went into the\\nkitchen and began to wash and rub the potatoes and to make them into\\nballs as they are eaten by the countryfolks whilst she was busy with\\nthis work the peasant said to the stranger come into my garden with\\nme for a while i have still something to do there he had dug some\\nholes in the garden and now wanted to plant some trees in them have\\nyou no children asked the stranger who could help you with your\\nwork no answered the peasant i had a son it is true but it is\\nlong since he went out into the world he was a neerdowell sharp\\nand knowing but he would learn nothing and was full of bad tricks at\\nlast he ran away from me and since then i have heard nothing of him\\n\\nthe old man took a young tree put it in a hole drove in a post beside\\nit and when he had shovelled in some earth and had trampled it firmly\\ndown he tied the stem of the tree above below and in the middle\\nfast to the post by a rope of straw but tell me said the stranger\\nwhy you dont tie that crooked knotted tree which is lying in the\\ncorner there bent down almost to the ground to a post also that it\\nmay grow straight as well as these the old man smiled and said\\nsir you speak according to your knowledge it is easy to see that you\\nare not familiar with gardening that tree there is old and\\nmisshapen no one can make it straight now trees must be trained\\nwhile they are young that is how it was with your son said the\\nstranger if you had trained him while he was still young he would\\nnot have run away now he too must have grown hard and misshapen\\ntruly it is a long time since he went away replied the old man he\\nmust have changed would you know him again if he were to come to\\nyou asked the stranger hardly by his face replied the peasant\\nbut he has a mark about him a birthmark on his shoulder that looks\\nlike a bean when he had said that the stranger pulled off his coat\\nbared his shoulder and showed the peasant the bean good god cried\\nthe old man thou art really my son and love for his child stirred\\nin his heart but he added how canst thou be my son thou hast\\nbecome a great lord and livest in wealth and luxury how hast thou\\ncontrived to do that ah father answered the son the young tree\\nwas bound to no post and has grown crooked now it is too old it will\\nnever be straight again how have i got all that i have become a\\nthief but do not be alarmed i am a masterthief for me there are\\nneither locks nor bolts whatsoever i desire is mine do not imagine\\nthat i steal like a common thief i only take some of the superfluity\\nof the rich poor people are safe i would rather give to them than\\ntake anything from them it is the same with anything which i can have\\nwithout trouble cunning and dexterity i never touch it alas my\\nson said the father it still does not please me a thief is still a\\nthief i tell thee it will end badly he took him to his mother and\\nwhen she heard that was her son she wept for joy but when he told her\\nthat he had become a masterthief two streams flowed down over her\\nface at length she said even if he has become a thief he is still\\nmy son and my eyes have beheld him once more they sat down to table\\nand once again he ate with his parents the wretched food which he had\\nnot eaten for so long the father said if our lord the count up\\nthere in the castle learns who thou art and what trade thou\\nfollowest he will not take thee in his arms and cradle thee in them as\\nhe did when he held thee at the font but will cause thee to swing from\\na halter be easy father he will do me no harm for i understand my\\ntrade i will go to him myself this very day when evening drew near\\nthe masterthief seated himself in his carriage and drove to the\\ncastle the count received him civilly for he took him for a\\ndistinguished man when however the stranger made himself known the\\ncount turned pale and was quite silent for some time at length he\\nsaid thou art my godson and on that account mercy shall take the\\nplace of justice and i will deal leniently with thee since thou\\npridest thyself on being a masterthief i will put thy art to the\\nproof but if thou dost not stand the test thou must marry the\\nropemakers daughter and the croaking of the raven must be thy music\\non the occasion lord count answered the masterthief think of\\nthree things as difficult as you like and if i do not perform your\\ntasks do with me what you will the count reflected for some minutes\\nand then said well then in the first place thou shalt steal the\\nhorse i keep for my own riding out of the stable in the next thou\\nshalt steal the sheet from beneath the bodies of my wife and myself\\nwhen we are asleep without our observing it and the weddingring of\\nmy wife as well thirdly and lastly thou shalt steal away out of the\\nchurch the parson and clerk mark what i am saying for thy life\\ndepends on it\\n\\nthe masterthief went to the nearest town there he bought the clothes\\nof an old peasant woman and put them on then he stained his face\\nbrown and painted wrinkles on it as well so that no one could have\\nrecognized him then he filled a small cask with old hungary wine in\\nwhich was mixed a powerful sleepingdrink he put the cask in a basket\\nwhich he took on his back and walked with slow and tottering steps to\\nthe counts castle it was already dark when he arrived he sat down on\\na stone in the courtyard and began to cough like an asthmatic old\\nwoman and to rub his hands as if he were cold in front of the door of\\nthe stable some soldiers were lying round a fire one of them observed\\nthe woman and called out to her come nearer old mother and warm\\nthyself beside us after all thou hast no bed for the night and must\\ntake one where thou canst find it the old woman tottered up to them\\nbegged them to lift the basket from her back and sat down beside them\\nat the fire what hast thou got in thy little cask old lady asked\\none a good mouthful of wine she answered i live by trade for\\nmoney and fair words i am quite ready to let you have a glass let us\\nhave it here then said the soldier and when he had tasted one glass\\nhe said when wine is good i like another glass and had another\\npoured out for himself and the rest followed his example hallo\\ncomrades cried one of them to those who were in the stable here is\\nan old goody who has wine that is as old as herself take a draught it\\nwill warm your stomachs far better than our fire the old woman\\ncarried her cask into the stable one of the soldiers had seated\\nhimself on the saddled ridinghorse another held its bridle in his\\nhand a third had laid hold of its tail she poured out as much as they\\nwanted until the spring ran dry it was not long before the bridle fell\\nfrom the hand of the one and he fell down and began to snore the\\nother left hold of the tail lay down and snored still louder the one\\nwho was sitting in the saddle did remain sitting but bent his head\\nalmost down to the horses neck and slept and blew with his mouth like\\nthe bellows of a forge the soldiers outside had already been asleep\\nfor a long time and were lying on the ground motionless as if dead\\nwhen the masterthief saw that he had succeeded he gave the first a\\nrope in his hand instead of the bridle and the other who had been\\nholding the tail a wisp of straw but what was he to do with the one\\nwho was sitting on the horses back he did not want to throw him down\\nfor he might have awakened and have uttered a cry he had a good idea\\nhe unbuckled the girths of the saddle tied a couple of ropes which\\nwere hanging to a ring on the wall fast to the saddle and drew the\\nsleeping rider up into the air on it then he twisted the rope round\\nthe posts and made it fast he soon unloosed the horse from the chain\\nbut if he had ridden over the stony pavement of the yard they would\\nhave heard the noise in the castle so he wrapped the horses hoofs in\\nold rags led him carefully out leapt upon him and galloped off\\n\\nwhen day broke the master galloped to the castle on the stolen horse\\nthe count had just got up and was looking out of the window good\\nmorning sir count he cried to him here is the horse which i have\\ngot safely out of the stable just look how beautifully your soldiers\\nare lying there sleeping and if you will but go into the stable you\\nwill see how comfortable your watchers have made it for themselves\\nthe count could not help laughing then he said for once thou hast\\nsucceeded but things wont go so well the second time and i warn thee\\nthat if thou comest before me as a thief i will handle thee as i would\\na thief when the countess went to bed that night she closed her hand\\nwith the weddingring tightly together and the count said all the\\ndoors are locked and bolted i will keep awake and wait for the thief\\nbut if he gets in by the window i will shoot him the masterthief\\nhowever went in the dark to the gallows cut a poor sinner who was\\nhanging there down from the halter and carried him on his back to the\\ncastle then he set a ladder up to the bedroom put the dead body on\\nhis shoulders and began to climb up when he had got so high that the\\nhead of the dead man showed at the window the count who was watching\\nin his bed fired a pistol at him and immediately the master let the\\npoor sinner fall down and hid himself in one corner the night was\\nsufficiently lighted by the moon for the master to see distinctly how\\nthe count got out of the window on to the ladder came down carried\\nthe dead body into the garden and began to dig a hole in which to lay\\nit now thought the thief the favourable moment has come stole\\nnimbly out of his corner and climbed up the ladder straight into the\\ncountesss bedroom dear wife he began in the counts voice the\\nthief is dead but after all he is my godson and has been more of a\\nscapegrace than a villain i will not put him to open shame besides\\ni am sorry for the parents i will bury him myself before daybreak in\\nthe garden that the thing may not be known so give me the sheet i\\nwill wrap up the body in it and bury him as a dog burries things by\\nscratching the countess gave him the sheet i tell you what\\ncontinued the thief i have a fit of magnanimity on me give me the\\nring too—the unhappy man risked his life for it so he may take it\\nwith him into his grave she would not gainsay the count and although\\nshe did it unwillingly she drew the ring from her finger and gave it\\nto him the thief made off with both these things and reached home\\nsafely before the count in the garden had finished his work of burying\\n\\nwhat a long face the count did pull when the master came next morning\\nand brought him the sheet and the ring art thou a wizard said he\\nwho has fetched thee out of the grave in which i myself laid thee and\\nbrought thee to life again you did not bury me said the thief\\nbut the poor sinner on the gallows and he told him exactly how\\neverything had happened and the count was forced to own to him that he\\nwas a clever crafty thief but thou hast not reached the end yet he\\nadded thou hast still to perform the third task and if thou dost not\\nsucceed in that all is of no use the master smiled and returned no\\nanswer when night had fallen he went with a long sack on his back a\\nbundle under his arms and a lantern in his hand to the villagechurch\\nin the sack he had some crabs and in the bundle short waxcandles he\\nsat down in the churchyard took out a crab and stuck a waxcandle on\\nhis back then he lighted the little light put the crab on the ground\\nand let it creep about he took a second out of the sack and treated\\nit in the same way and so on until the last was out of the sack\\nhereupon he put on a long black garment that looked like a monks cowl\\nand stuck a gray beard on his chin when at last he was quite\\nunrecognizable he took the sack in which the crabs had been went into\\nthe church and ascended the pulpit the clock in the tower was just\\nstriking twelve when the last stroke had sounded he cried with a loud\\nand piercing voice hearken sinful men the end of all things has\\ncome the last day is at hand hearken hearken whosoever wishes to go\\nto heaven with me must creep into the sack i am peter who opens and\\nshuts the gate of heaven behold how the dead outside there in the\\nchurchyard are wandering about collecting their bones come come and\\ncreep into the sack the world is about to be destroyed the cry\\nechoed through the whole village the parson and clerk who lived\\nnearest to the church heard it first and when they saw the lights\\nwhich were moving about the churchyard they observed that something\\nunusual was going on and went into the church they listened to the\\nsermon for a while and then the clerk nudged the parson and said it\\nwould not be amiss if we were to use the opportunity together and\\nbefore the dawning of the last day find an easy way of getting to\\nheaven to tell the truth answered the parson that is what i\\nmyself have been thinking so if you are inclined we will set out on\\nour way yes answered the clerk but you the pastor have the\\nprecedence i will follow so the parson went first and ascended the\\npulpit where the master opened his sack the parson crept in first and\\nthen the clerk the master immediately tied up the sack tightly seized\\nit by the middle and dragged it down the pulpitsteps and whenever\\nthe heads of the two fools bumped against the steps he cried we are\\ngoing over the mountains then he drew them through the village in the\\nsame way and when they were passing through puddles he cried now we\\nare going through wet clouds and when at last he was dragging them up\\nthe steps of the castle he cried now we are on the steps of heaven\\nand will soon be in the outer court when he had got to the top he\\npushed the sack into the pigeonhouse and when the pigeons fluttered\\nabout he said hark how glad the angels are and how they are\\nflapping their wings then he bolted the door upon them and went\\naway\\n\\nnext morning he went to the count and told him that he had performed\\nthe third task also and had carried the parson and clerk out of the\\nchurch where hast thou left them asked the lord they are lying\\nupstairs in a sack in the pigeonhouse and imagine that they are in\\nheaven the count went up himself and convinced himself that the\\nmaster had told the truth when he had delivered the parson and clerk\\nfrom their captivity he said thou art an archthief and hast won\\nthy wager for once thou escapest with a whole skin but see that thou\\nleavest my land for if ever thou settest foot on it again thou mayst\\ncount on thy elevation to the gallows the archthief took leave of\\nhis parents once more went forth into the wide world

       " 'a young drummer went out quite alone one evening into the country and\\ncame to a lake on the shore of which he perceived three pieces of white\\nlinen lying what fine linen said he and put

was aware of a soft voice\\nwhich cried to him drummer drummer wake up as it was a dark night\\nhe could see no one but it appeared to him that a figure was hovering\\nabout his bed what do you want he asked give me back my dress\\nanswered the voice that you took away from me last evening by the\\nlake you shall have it back again said the drummer if you will\\ntell me who you are ah replied the voice i am the daughter of a\\nmighty king but i have fallen into the power of a witch and am shut\\nup on the glassmountain i have to bathe in the lake every day with my\\ntwo sisters but i cannot fly back again without my dress my sisters\\nhave gone away but i have been forced to stay behind i entreat you to\\ngive me my dress back be easy poor child said the drummer i\\nwill willingly give it back to you he took it out of his pocket and\\nreached it to her in the dark she snatched it in haste and wanted to\\ngo away with it stop a moment perhaps i can help you you can only\\nhelp me by ascending the glassmountain and freeing me from the power\\nof the witch but you cannot come to the glassmountain and indeed if\\nyou were quite close to it you could not ascend it when i want to do\\na thing i always can do it said the drummer i am sorry for you and\\nhave no fear of anything but i do not know the way which leads to the\\nglassmountain the road goes through the great forest in which the\\nmaneaters live she answered and more than that i dare not tell\\nyou and then he heard her wings quiver as she flew away\\n\\nby daybreak the drummer arose buckled on his drum and went without\\nfear straight into the forest after he had walked for a while without\\nseeing any giants he thought to himself i must waken up the\\nsluggards and he hung his drum before him and beat such a reveille\\nthat the birds flew out of the trees with loud cries it was not long\\nbefore a giant who had been lying sleeping among the grass rose up\\nand was as tall as a firtree wretch cried he what art thou\\ndrumming here for and wakening me out of my best sleep i am\\ndrumming he replied because i want to show the way to many\\nthousands who are following me what do they want in my forest\\ndemanded the giant they want to put an end to thee and cleanse the\\nforest of such a monster as thou art oho said the giant i will\\ntrample you all to death like so many ants dost thou think thou\\ncanst do anything against us said the drummer if thou stoopest to\\ntake hold of one he will jump away and hide himself but when thou art\\nlying down and sleeping they will come forth from every thicket and\\ncreep up to thee every one of them has a hammer of steel in his belt\\nand with that they will beat in thy skull the giant grew angry and\\nthought if i meddle with the crafty

seat thyself on my shoulder i will carry thee where thou\\nwishest to be the giant lifted him up and the drummer began to beat\\nhis drum up aloft to his hearts delight the giant thought that is\\nthe signal for the other people to turn back\\n\\nafter a while a second giant was standing in the road who took the\\ndrummer from the first and stuck him in his buttonhole the drummer\\nlaid hold of the button which was as large as a dish held on by it\\nand looked merrily around then they came to a third giant who took\\nhim out of the buttonhole and set him on the rim of his hat then the\\ndrummer walked backwards and forwards up above and looked over the\\ntrees and when he perceived a mountain in the blue distance he\\nthought that must be the glassmountain and so it was the giant\\nonly made two steps more and they reached the foot of the mountain\\nwhere the giant put him down the drummer demanded to be put on the\\nsummit of the glassmountain but the giant shook his head growled\\nsomething in his beard and went back into the forest\\n\\nand now the poor drummer was standing before the mountain which was as\\nhigh as if three mountains were piled on each other and at the same\\ntime as smooth as a lookingglass and did not know how to get up it\\nhe began to climb but that was useless for he always slipped back\\nagain if one was a bird now thought he but what was the good of\\nwishing no wings grew for him\\n\\nwhilst he was standing thus not knowing what to do he saw not far\\nfrom him two men who were struggling fiercely together he went up to\\nthem and saw that they were disputing about a saddle which was lying on\\nthe ground before them and which both of them wanted to have what\\nfools you are said he to quarrel about a saddle when you have not\\na horse for it the saddle is worth fighting about answered one of\\nthe men whosoever sits on it and wishes himself in any place even\\nif it should be the very end of the earth gets there the instant he\\nhas uttered the wish the saddle belongs to us in common it is my turn\\nto ride on it but that other man will not let me do it i will soon\\ndecide the quarrel said the drummer and he went to a short distance\\nand stuck a white rod in the ground then he came back and said now\\nrun to the goal and whoever gets there first shall ride first both\\nput themselves into a trot but hardly had they gone a couple of steps\\nbefore the drummer swung himself on the saddle wished himself on the\\nglassmountain and before any one could turn round he was there on\\nthe top of the mountain was a plain there stood an old stone house\\nand in front of the house lay a great fishpond but behind it was a\\ndark forest he saw neither men nor animals everything was quiet only\\nthe wind rustled amongst the trees and the clouds moved by quite close\\nabove his head he went to the door and knocked when he had knocked\\nfor the third time an old woman with a brown face and red eyes opened\\nthe door she had spectacles on her long nose and looked sharply at\\nhim then she asked what he wanted entrance food and a bed for the\\nnight replied the drummer that thou shalt have said the old\\nwoman if thou wilt perform three services in return why not he\\nanswered i am not afraid of any kind of work however hard it may\\nbe the old woman let him go in and gave him some food and a good bed\\nat night the next morning when he had had his sleep out she took a\\nthimble from her wrinkled finger reached it to the drummer and said\\ngo to work now and empty out the pond with this thimble but thou\\nmust have it done before night and must have sought out all the fishes\\nwhich are in the water and laid them side by side according to their\\nkind and size that is strange work said the drummer but he went\\nto the pond and began to empty it he baled the whole morning but\\nwhat can any one do to a great lake with a thimble even if he were to\\nbale for a thousand years\\n\\nwhen it was noon he thought it is all useless and whether i work or\\nnot it will come to the same thing so he gave it up and sat down\\nthen came a maiden out of the house who set a little basket with food\\nbefore him and said what ails thee that thou sittest so sadly\\nhere he looked at her and saw that she was wondrously beautiful\\nah said he i cannot finish the first piece of work how will it be\\nwith the others i came forth to seek a kings daughter who is said to\\ndwell here but i have not found her and i will go farther stay\\nhere said the maiden i will help thee out of thy difficulty thou\\nart tired lay thy head in my lap and sleep when thou awakest again\\nthy work will be done the drummer did not need to be told that twice\\nas soon as his eyes were shut she turned a wishingring and said\\nrise water fishes come out instantly the water rose on high like\\na white mist and moved away with the other clouds and the fishes\\nsprang on the shore and laid themselves side by side each according to\\nhis size and kind when the drummer awoke he saw with amazement that\\nall was done but the maiden said one of the fish is not lying with\\nthose of its own kind but quite alone when the old woman comes\\ntonight and sees that all she demanded has been done she will ask\\nthee what is this fish lying alone for then throw the fish in her\\nface and say this one shall be for thee old witch in the evening\\nthe witch came and when she had put this question he threw the fish\\nin her face she behaved as if she did not remark it and said nothing\\nbut looked at him with malicious eyes next morning she said\\nyesterday it was too easy for thee i must give thee harder work\\ntoday thou must hew down the whole of the forest split the wood into\\nlogs and pile them up and everything must be finished by the\\nevening she gave him an axe a mallet and two wedges but the axe\\nwas made of lead and the mallet and wedges were of tin when he began\\nto cut the edge of the axe turned back and the mallet and wedges were\\nbeaten out of shape he did not know how to manage but at midday the\\nmaiden came once more with his dinner and comforted him lay thy head\\non my lap said she and sleep when thou awakest thy work will be\\ndone she turned her wishingring and in an instant the whole forest\\nfell down with a crash the wood split and arranged itself in heaps\\nand it seemed just as if unseen giants were finishing the work when he\\nawoke the maiden said dost thou see that the wood is piled up and\\narranged one bough alone remains but when the old woman comes this\\nevening and asks thee about that bough give her a blow with it and\\nsay that is for thee thou witch\\n\\nthe old woman came there thou seest how easy the work was said she\\nbut for whom hast thou left that bough which is lying there still\\n\\nfor thee thou witch he replied and gave her a blow with it but\\nshe pretended not to feel it laughed scornfully and said early\\ntomorrow morning thou shalt arrange all the wood in one heap set fire\\nto it and burn it he rose at break of day and began to pick up the\\nwood but how can a single man get a whole forest together the work\\nmade no progress the maiden however did not desert him in his need\\nshe brought him his food at noon and when he had eaten he laid his\\nhead on her lap and went to sleep when he awoke the entire pile of\\nwood was burning in one enormous flame which stretched its tongues out\\ninto the sky listen to me said the maiden when the witch comes\\nshe will give thee all kinds of orders do whatever she asks thee\\nwithout fear and then she will not be able to get the better of thee\\nbut if thou art afraid the fire will lay hold of thee and consume\\nthee at last when thou hast done everything seize her with both thy\\nhands and throw her into the midst of the fire the maiden departed\\nand the old woman came sneaking up to him oh i am cold said she\\nbut that is a fire that burns it warms my old bones for me and does\\nme good but there is a log lying there which wont burn bring it out\\nfor me when thou hast done that thou art free and mayst go where\\nthou likest come go in with a good will\\n\\nthe drummer did not reflect long he sprang into the midst of the\\nflames but they did not hurt him and could not even singe a hair of\\nhis head he carried the log out and laid it down hardly however\\nhad the wood touched the earth than it was transformed and the\\nbeautiful maiden who had helped him in his need stood before him and\\nby the silken and shining golden garments which she wore he knew right\\nwell that she was the kings daughter but the old woman laughed\\nvenomously and said thou thinkest thou hast her safe but thou hast\\nnot got her yet just as she was about to fall on the maiden and take\\nher away the youth seized the old woman with both his hands raised\\nher up on high and threw her into the jaws of the fire which closed\\nover her as if it were delighted that an old witch was to be burnt\\n\\nthen the kings daughter looked at the drummer and when she saw that\\nhe was a handsome youth and remembered how he had risked his life to\\ndeliver her she gave him her hand and said thou hast ventured\\neverything for my sake but i also will do everything for thine\\npromise to be true to me and thou shalt be my husband we shall not\\nwant for riches we shall have enough with what the witch has gathered\\ntogether here she led him into the house where there were chests and\\ncoffers crammed with the old womans treasures the maiden left the\\ngold and silver where it was and took only the precious stones she\\nwould not stay any longer on the glassmountain so the drummer said to\\nher seat thyself by me on my saddle and then we will fly down like\\nbirds i do not like the old saddle said she i need only turn my\\nwishingring and we shall be at home very well then answered the\\ndrummer then wish us in front of the towngate in the twinkling of\\nan eye they were there but the drummer said i will just go to my\\nparents and tell them the news wait for me outside here i shall soon\\nbe back ah said the kings daughter i beg thee to be careful on\\nthy arrival do not kiss thy parents on the right cheek or else thou\\nwilt forget everything and i shall stay behind here outside alone and\\ndeserted how can i forget thee said he and promised her to come\\nback very soon and gave his hand upon it when he went into his\\nfathers house he had changed so much that no one knew who he was for\\nthe three days which he had passed on the glassmountain had been three\\nyears then he made himself known and his parents fell on his neck\\nwith joy and his heart was so moved that he forgot what the maiden had\\nsaid and kissed them on both cheeks but when he had given them the\\nkiss on the right cheek every thought of the kings daughter vanished\\nfrom him he emptied out his pockets and laid handfuls of the largest\\njewels on the table the parents had not the least idea what to do with\\nthe riches then the father built a magnificent castle all surrounded\\nby gardens woods and meadows as if a prince were going to live in it\\nand when it was ready the mother said i have found a maiden for\\nthee and the wedding shall be in three days the son was content to do\\nas his parents desired\\n\\nthe poor kings daughter had stood for a long time without the town\\nwaiting for the return of the young man when evening came she said\\nhe must certainly have kissed his parents on the right cheek and has\\nforgotten me her heart was full of sorrow she wished herself into a\\nsolitary little hut in a forest and would not return to her fathers\\ncourt every evening she went into the town and passed the young mans\\nhouse he often saw her but he no longer knew her at length she heard\\nthe people saying the wedding will take place tomorrow then she\\nsaid i will try if i can win his heart back\\n\\non the first day of the wedding ceremonies she turned her\\nwishingring and said a dress as bright as the sun instantly the\\ndress lay before her and it was as bright as if it had been woven of\\nreal sunbeams when all the guests were assembled she entered the\\nhall every one was amazed at the beautiful dress and the bride most\\nof all and as pretty dresses were the things she had most delight in\\nshe went to the stranger and asked if she would sell it to her not\\nfor money she answered but if i may pass the first night outside\\nthe door of the room where your betrothed sleeps i will give it up to\\nyou the bride could not overcome her desire and consented but she\\nmixed a sleepingdraught with the wine her betrothed took at night\\nwhich made him fall into a deep sleep when all had become quiet the\\nkings daughter crouched down by the door of the bedroom opened it\\njust a little and cried\\n\\ndrummer drummer i pray thee hear\\nhast thou forgotten thou heldest me dear\\nthat on the glassmountain we sat hour by hour\\nthat i rescued thy life from the witchs power\\ndidst thou not plight thy troth to me\\ndrummer drummer hearken to me\\n\\n\\nbut it was all in vain the drummer did not awake and when morning\\ndawned the kings daughter was forced to go back again as she came on\\nthe second evening she turned her wishingring and said a dress as\\nsilvery as the moon when she appeared at the feast in the dress which\\nwas as soft as moonbeams it again excited the desire of the bride and\\nthe kings daughter gave it to her for permission to pass the second\\nnight also outside the door of the bedroom then in the stillness of\\nthe night she cried\\n\\ndrummer drummer i pray thee hear\\nhast thou forgotten thy heldest me dear\\nthat on the glassmountain we sat hour by hour\\nthat i rescued thy life from the witchs power\\ndidst thou not plight thy troth to me\\ndrummer drummer hearken to me\\n\\n\\nbut the drummer who was stupefied with the sleepingdraught could not\\nbe aroused sadly next morning she went back to her hut in the forest\\nbut the people in the house had heard the lamentation of the\\nstrangermaiden and told the bridegroom about it they told him also\\nthat it was impossible that he could hear anything of it because the\\nmaiden he was going to marry had poured a sleepingdraught into his\\nwine\\n\\non the third evening the kings daughter turned her wishingring and\\nsaid a dress glittering like the stars when she showed herself\\ntherein at the feast the bride was quite beside herself with the\\nsplendour of the dress which far surpassed the others and she said\\ni must and will have it the maiden gave it as she had given the\\nothers for permission to spend the night outside the bridegrooms door\\nthe bridegroom however did not drink the wine which was handed to him\\nbefore he went to bed but poured it behind the bed and when\\neverything was quiet he heard a sweet voice which called to him\\n\\ndrummer drummer i pray thee hear\\nhast thou forgotten thou held me dear\\nthat on the glassmountain we sat hour by hour\\nthat i rescued thy life from the witchs power\\ndidst thou not plight thy troth to me\\ndrummer drummer hearken to me\\n\\n\\nsuddenly his memory returned to him ah cried he how can i have\\nacted so unfaithfully but the kiss which in the joy of my heart i gave\\nmy parents on the right cheek that is to blame for it all that is\\nwhat stupefied me he sprang up took the kings daughter by the hand\\nand led her to his parents bed this is my true bride said he if\\ni marry the other i shall do a great wrong the parents when they\\nheard how everything had happened gave their consent then the lights\\nin the hall were lighted again drums and trumpets were brought\\nfriends and relations were invited to come and the real wedding was\\nsolemnized with great rejoicing the first bride received the beautiful\\ndresses as a

       " 'there was once a king who had a son who asked in marriage the daughter\\nof a mighty king she was called maid maleen and was very beautiful\\nas her father wished to give her to another the prince was rejected\\nbut as they both loved each other with all their hearts they would not\\ngive each other up and maid maleen said to her father i can and will\\ntake no other for my husband then the king flew into a passion and\\nordered a dark tower to be built into which no ray of sunlight or\\nmoonlight should enter when it was finished he said therein shalt\\nthou be imprisoned for seven years and then i will come and see if thy\\nperverse spirit is broken meat and drink for the seven years were\\ncarried into the tower and then she and her waitingwoman were led\\ninto it and walled up and thus cut off from the sky and from the\\nearth there they sat in the darkness and knew not when day or night\\nbegan the kings son often went round and round the tower and called\\ntheir names but no sound from without pierced through the thick walls\\nwhat else could they do but lament and complain meanwhile the time\\npassed and by the diminution of the food and drink they knew that the\\nseven years were coming to an end they thought the moment of their\\ndeliverance was come but no stroke of the hammer was heard no stone\\nfell out of the wall and it seemed to maid maleen that her father had\\nforgotten her as they only had food for a short time longer and saw a\\nmiserable death awaiting them maid maleen said we must try our last\\nchance and see if we can break through the wall she took the\\nbreadknife and picked and bored at the mortar of a stone and when\\nshe was tired the waitingmaid took her turn with great labour they\\nsucceeded in getting out one stone and then a second and a third and\\nwhen three days were over the first ray of light fell on their\\ndarkness and at last the opening was so large that they could look\\nout the sky was blue and a fresh breeze played on their faces but\\nhow melancholy everything looked all around her fathers castle lay in\\nruins the town and the villages were so far as could be seen\\ndestroyed by fire the fields far and wide laid to waste and no human\\nbeing was visible when the opening in the wall was large enough for\\nthem to slip through the waitingmaid sprang down first and then maid\\nmaleen followed but where were they to go the enemy had ravaged the\\nwhole kingdom driven away the king and slain all the inhabitants\\nthey wandered forth to seek another country but nowhere did they find\\na shelter or a human being to give them a mouthful of bread and their\\nneed was so great that they were forced to appease their hunger with\\nnettles when after long journeying they came into another country\\nthey tried to get work everywhere but wherever they knocked they were\\nturned away and no one would have pity on them at last they arrived\\nin a large city and went to the royal palace there also they were\\nordered to go away but at last the cook said that they might stay in\\nthe kitchen and be scullions\\n\\nthe son of the king in whose kingdom they were was however the very\\nman who had been betrothed to maid maleen his father had chosen\\nanother bride for him whose face was as ugly as her heart was wicked\\nthe wedding was fixed and the maiden had already arrived but because\\nof her great ugliness however she shut herself in her room and\\nallowed no one to see her and maid maleen had to take her her meals\\nfrom the kitchen when the day came for the bride and the bridegroom to\\ngo to church she was ashamed of her ugliness and afraid that if she\\nshowed herself in the streets she would be mocked and laughed at by\\nthe people then said she to maid maleen a great piece of luck has\\nbefallen thee i have sprained my foot and cannot well walk through\\nthe streets thou shalt put on my weddingclothes and take my place a\\ngreater honour than that thou canst not have maid maleen however\\nrefused it and said i wish for no honour which is not suitable for\\nme it was in vain too that the bride offered her gold at last she\\nsaid angrily if thou dost not obey me it shall cost thee thy life i\\nhave but to speak the word and thy head will lie at thy feet then\\nshe was forced to obey and put on the brides magnificent clothes and\\nall her jewels when she entered the royal hall every one was amazed\\nat her great beauty and the king said to his son this is the bride\\nwhom i have chosen for thee and whom thou must lead to church the\\nbridegroom was astonished and thought she is like my maid maleen\\nand i should believe that it was she herself but she has long been\\nshut up in the tower or dead he took her by the hand and led her to\\nchurch on the way was a nettleplant and she said\\n\\noh nettleplant\\nlittle nettleplant\\nwhat dost thou here alone\\ni have known the time\\nwhen i ate thee unboiled\\nwhen i ate thee unroasted\\n\\n\\nwhat art thou saying asked the kings son nothing she replied\\ni was only thinking of maid maleen he was surprised that she knew\\nabout her but kept silence when they came to the footplank into the\\nchurchyard she said\\n\\nfootbridge do not break\\ni am not the true bride\\n\\n\\nwhat art thou saying there asked the kings son nothing she\\nreplied i was only thinking of maid maleen dost thou know maid\\nmaleen no she answered how should i know her i have only heard\\nof her when they came to the churchdoor she said once more\\n\\nchurchdoor break not\\ni am not the true bride\\n\\n\\nwhat art thou saying there asked he ah she answered i was only\\nthinking of maid maleen then he took out a precious chain put it\\nround her neck and fastened the clasp thereupon they entered the\\nchurch and the priest joined their hands together before the altar\\nand married them he led her home but she did not speak a single word\\nthe whole way when they got back to the royal palace she hurried into\\nthe brides chamber put off the magnificent clothes and the jewels\\ndressed herself in her gray gown and kept nothing but the jewel on her\\nneck which she had received from the bridegroom\\n\\nwhen the night came and the bride was to be led into the princes\\napartment she let her veil fall over her face that he might not\\nobserve the deception as soon as every one had gone away he said to\\nher what didst thou say to the nettleplant which was growing by the\\nwayside\\n\\nto which nettleplant asked she i dont talk to nettleplants\\nif thou didst not do it then thou art not the true bride said he\\nso she bethought herself and said\\n\\ni must go out unto my maid\\nwho keeps my thoughts for me\\n\\n\\nshe went out and sought maid maleen girl what hast thou been saying\\nto the nettle i said nothing but\\n\\noh nettleplant\\nlittle nettleplant\\nwhat dost thou here alone\\ni have known the time\\nwhen i ate thee unboiled\\nwhen i ate thee

when we went over it\\nasked the kings son to the footbridge she answered i dont talk\\nto footbridges then thou art not the true bride\\n\\nshe again said\\n\\ni must go out unto my maid\\nwho keeps my thoughts for me\\n\\n\\nand ran out and found maid maleen girl what didst thou say to the\\nfootbridge\\n\\ni said nothing but\\n\\nfootbridge do not break\\ni am not the true bride\\n\\n\\nthat costs thee thy life cried the bride but she hurried into the\\nroom and said i know now what i said to the footbridge and she\\nrepeated the words but what didst thou say to the churchdoor to\\nthe churchdoor she replied i dont talk to churchdoors then\\nthou art not the true bride\\n\\nshe went out and found maid maleen and said girl what didst thou\\nsay to the churchdoor\\n\\ni said nothing but\\n\\nchurchdoor break not\\ni am not the true bride\\n\\n\\nthat will break thy neck for thee cried the bride and flew into a\\nterrible passion but she hastened back into the room and said i\\nknow now what i said to the churchdoor and she repeated the words\\nbut where hast thou the jewel which i gave thee at the churchdoor\\nwhat jewel she answered thou didst not give me any jewel i\\nmyself put it round thy neck and i myself fastened it if thou dost\\nnot know that thou art not the true bride he drew the veil from her\\nface and when he saw her immeasurable ugliness he sprang back\\nterrified and said how comest thou here who art thou i am thy\\nbetrothed bride but because i feared lest the people should mock me\\nwhen they saw me out of doors i commanded the scullerymaid to dress\\nherself in my clothes and to go to church instead of me where is\\nthe girl said he i want to see her go and bring her here she\\nwent out and told the servants that the scullerymaid was an impostor\\nand that they must take her out into the courtyard and strike off her\\nhead the servants laid hold of maid maleen and wanted to drag her out\\nbut she screamed so loudly for help that the kings son heard her\\nvoice hurried out of his chamber and ordered them to set the maiden\\nfree instantly lights were brought and then he saw on her neck the\\ngold chain which he had given her at the churchdoor thou art the\\ntrue bride said he who went with me to the church come with me now\\nto my room when they were both alone he said on the way to church\\nthou didst name maid maleen who

       " 'a soldier who is afraid of nothing troubles himself about nothing one\\nof this kind had received his discharge and as he had learnt no trade\\nand could earn nothing he travelled about and begged alms of kind\\npeople he had an old waterproof on his back and a pair of\\nridingboots of buffaloleather which were still left to him one day\\nhe was walking he knew not where straight out into the open country\\nand at length came to a forest he did not know where he was but saw\\nsitting on the trunk of a tree which had been cut down a man who was\\nwell dressed and wore a green shootingcoat the soldier shook hands\\nwith him sat down on the grass by his side and stretched out his\\nlegs i see thou hast good boots on which are well blacked said he\\nto the huntsman but if thou hadst to travel about as i have they\\nwould not last long look at mine they are of buffaloleather and\\nhave been worn for a long time but in them i can go through thick and\\nthin after a while the soldier got up and said i can stay no\\nlonger hunger drives me onwards but brother brightboots where does\\nthis road lead to i dont know that myself answered the huntsman\\ni have lost my way in the forest then thou art in the same plight\\nas i said the soldier birds of a feather flock together let us\\nremain together and seek our way the huntsman smiled a little and\\nthey walked on further and further until night fell we do not get\\nout of the forest said the soldier but there in the distance i see\\na light shining which will help us to something to eat they found a\\nstone house knocked at the door and an old woman opened it we are\\nlooking for quarters for the night said the soldier and some lining\\nfor our stomachs for mine is as empty as an old knapsack you cannot\\nstay here answered the old woman this is a robbers house and you\\nwould do wisely to get away before they come home or you will be\\nlost it wont be so bad as that answered the soldier i have not\\nhad a mouthful for two days and whether i am murdered here or die of\\nhunger in the forest is all the same to me i shall go in the\\nhuntsman would not follow but the soldier drew him in with him by the\\nsleeve come my dear brother we shall not come to an end so quickly\\nas that the old woman had pity on them and said creep in here\\nbehind the stove and if they leave anything i will give it to you on\\nthe sly when they are asleep scarcely were they in the corner before\\ntwelve robbers came bursting in seated themselves at the table which\\nwas already laid and vehemently demanded some food the old woman\\nbrought in some great dishes of roast meat and the robbers enjoyed\\nthat thoroughly when the smell of the food ascended the nostrils of\\nthe soldier he said to the huntsman i cannot hold out any longer i\\nshall seat myself at the table and eat with them thou wilt bring us\\nto destruction said the huntsman and held him back by the arm but\\nthe soldier began to cough loudly when the robbers heard that they\\nthrew away their knives and forks leapt up and discovered the two who\\nwere behind the stove aha gentlemen are you in the corner cried\\nthey what are you doing here have you been sent as spies wait a\\nwhile and you shall learn how to fly on a dry bough but do be\\ncivil said the soldier i am hungry give me something to eat and\\nthen you can do what you like with me the robbers were astonished\\nand the captain said i see that thou hast no fear well thou shalt\\nhave some food but after that thou must die we shall see said the\\nsoldier and seated himself at the table and began to cut away\\nvaliantly at the roast meat brother brightboots come and eat cried\\nhe to the huntsman thou must be as hungry as i am and cannot have\\nbetter roast meat at home but the huntsman would not eat the robbers\\nlooked at the soldier in astonishment and said the rascal uses no\\nceremony after a while he said i have had enough food now get me\\nsomething good to drink the captain was in the mood to humour him in\\nthis also and called to the old woman bring a bottle out of the\\ncellar and mind it be of the best the soldier drew the cork out with\\na loud noise and then went with the bottle to the huntsman and said\\npay attention brother and thou shalt see something that will\\nsurprise thee i am now going to drink the health of the whole clan\\nthen he brandished the bottle over the heads of the robbers and cried\\nlong life to you all but with your mouths open and your right hands\\nlifted up and then he drank a hearty draught scarcely were the words\\nsaid than they all sat motionless as if made of stone and their mouths\\nwere open and their right hands stretched up in the air the huntsman\\nsaid to the soldier i see that thou art acquainted with tricks of\\nanother kind but now come and let us go home oho my dear brother\\nbut that would be marching away far too soon we have conquered the\\nenemy and must first take the booty those men there are sitting fast\\nand are opening their mouths with astonishment but they will not be\\nallowed to move until i permit them come eat and drink the old\\nwoman had to bring another bottle of the best wine and the soldier\\nwould not stir until he had eaten enough to last for three days at\\nlast when day came he said now it is time to strike our tents and\\nthat our march may be a short one the old woman shall show us the\\nnearest way to the town when they had arrived there he went to his\\nold comrades and said out in the forest i have found a nest full of\\ngallows birds come with me and we will take it the soldier led\\nthem and said to the huntsman thou must go back again with me to see\\nhow they shake when we seize them by the feet he placed the men round\\nabout the robbers and then he took the bottle drank a mouthful\\nbrandished it above them and cried live again instantly they all\\nregained the power of movement but were thrown down and bound hand and\\nfoot with cords then the soldier ordered them to be thrown into a cart\\nas if they had been so many sacks and said now drive them straight\\nto prison the huntsman however took one of the men aside and gave\\nhim another commission besides brother brightboots said the\\nsoldier we have safely routed the enemy and been well fed now we\\nwill quietly walk behind them as if we were stragglers when they\\napproached the town the soldier saw a crowd of people pouring through\\nthe gate of the town who were raising loud cries of joy and waving\\ngreen boughs in the air then he saw that the entire bodyguard was\\ncoming up what can this mean said he to the huntsman dost thou\\nnot know he replied that the king has for a long time been absent\\nfrom his kingdom and that today he is returning and every one is\\ngoing to meet him but where is the king said the soldier i do\\nnot see him here he is answered the huntsman i am the king and\\nhave announced my arrival then he opened his huntingcoat and his\\nroyal garments were visible the soldier was alarmed and fell on his\\nknees and begged him to forgive him for having in his ignorance treated\\nhim as an equal and spoken to him by such a name but the king shook\\nhands with him and said thou art a brave soldier and hast saved my\\nlife thou shalt never again be in want i will take care of thee and\\nif ever

    "One issue we noticed before is that some words are separated by spaces, but others might be separated by newline characters (\\n). Since we don't care about poem structure in this exercise, the simplest solution is to replace line break characters with spaces. This will allow us to use the string.split() method afterwards using spaces to divide the stories up into tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we didn't do this in the first text-preprocessing step, where we argued we should make these changes in a way that minimized the number of iterations necessary in our code. The reason is simple: up to this point, we needed line breaks to split the text into individual poems. Now, the newline characters have served their purpose, and we can remove them before splitting further.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code cell below, create an empty list called poems_clean. Then build a loop that iterates through each item in our stories_dict, replaces all \\n characters with spaces, and appends the modified poem to our stories_clean dict."
