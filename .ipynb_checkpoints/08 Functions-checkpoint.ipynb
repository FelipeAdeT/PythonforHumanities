    "We learned about functions at the beginning of our course.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Functions** are blocks of code for performing an action that have been given a name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several predefined functions are available on the main Python module, and modules usually supply additional functions of their own. We have been using some of these functions, such as ```print()``` or ```len()```, for a while now. But we can also create (define) our own functions. In this lesson, we will learn how to define and call our own functions.\n",

    "# Methods\n",

    "We will not learn about defining object classes and their methods in this course, though you should know how to call existing methods. They are called by giving the object name, followed by a period and the method name:\n",

    "# Why define functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining functions helps us avoid repetition in the code, which has several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Organizes code into clear, purposeful chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prevents human error: code only has to be written (and corrected) once.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maximizes readability: minimize length & repetition\n",
    "\n",
    "- Makes code easier to maintain\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you find yourself repeatedly using the same chunk of code, it's good practice to move it into a function. It makes your script more legible, reduces the likelihood of errors, and makes your code more maintainable, because if you need to make a change, you only have to do it in one place. Functions can be tested and debugged separately from the code they will be used in.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip** Don't obsess over creating functions when starting a project. In a first pass, try focusing on working out a functioning script without using functions. Once you find a functional way to go through a project, you can return to your script, edit and improve it, and run it for all your data.\n",
    "\n",

Parameters are placeholder words for values that modify the way the function behaves. The statement ends in a **colon**. It is followed by the body of the function indented in a **code block**, which can include as many statements or nested code blocks as necessary.  Note that variable and parameter names used within a function definition are local to  the function, and will not cause problems if these names exist as variables or for other purposes in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once stored, we can **call** the function as many times as we would like using the function name. When we call a function that has already been defined, we give **arguments** or values for its parameters, within the parentheses.

To store these multiple results, all you need to do is assign the results of the function to multiple variables when calling the function.
