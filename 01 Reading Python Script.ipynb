    "    \n",
    "- Syntax Errors: Errors that indicate that there is a mistake in the structure of your code\n",
    "-Exceptions: The code is structurally correct, but fails to execute for another reason (perhaps because of invalid input).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python will point to the line where the earliest error has occurred. The error name and message will give clues as to what went wrong.\n",

    "- The Python language is human-readable because of its clear syntax and semantics.\n",
    "- In it, you create instances of objects and then perform actions on them.\n",
    "- It can be read much like sentences with nouns (objects) and a syntactical structure, or like a recipe with ingredients (semantics) and instructions (syntax).\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic syntax:\n",
    "- Comments (#) can help explain what each line is doing.\n",
    "- Each line (enter) represents a statement: an action.\n",
    "- Each code block (indent) is a set of actions performed together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic semantics:\n",
    "- Objects in Python have attributes and methods.\n",
    "- Variables assign a name to instances of objects.\n",
    "- Functions are pieces of code with a name that run an action. (Methods are a special type of function).\n",
    "- Modules are files that give access to functions, objects and variables created by others.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Finally, error messages give insight into how to correct your code, including what caused the error and where it occurred.\n",
