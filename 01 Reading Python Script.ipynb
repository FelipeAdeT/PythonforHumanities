    "- The Python language is human-readable because of its clear syntax and semantics.\n",
    "- In it, you create instances of objects and then perform actions on them.\n",
    "- It can be read much like sentences with nouns (objects) and a syntactical structure, or like a recipe with ingredients (semantics) and instructions (syntax).\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic syntax:\n",
    "- Comments (#) can help explain what each line is doing.\n",
    "- Each line (enter) represents a statement: an action.\n",
    "- Each code block (indent) is a set of actions performed together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic semantics:\n",
    "- Objects in Python have attributes and methods.\n",
    "- Variables assign a name to instances of objects.\n",
    "- Functions are pieces of code with a name that run an action. (Methods are a special type of function).\n",
    "- Modules are files that give access to functions, objects and variables created by others.\n",

    "- Finally, error messages give insight into how to correct your code, including what caused the error and where it occurred.\n",
