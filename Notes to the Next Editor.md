# Notes to the Next Editor

08-10-2020 Felipe √Ålvarez de Toledo

At this stage, the resource consists of:

- An introductory notebook (00)
- 10 lessons  that teach the building blocks of Python in a way that is hopefully well-suited to the needs of humanities students.
- 7B is a review lesson for lessons 1-7. It is a long-form exercise meant to help consolidate what was learned up to that point. Right now, it is a developed "answer key" to the exercises; a future editor would have to duplicate the document and adapt it so that students can develop their own code.

These lessons have been tested by volunteers and edited accordingly. Extensive edits were also provided by Eric Monson, who was an immense help. As the lessons are tested by more students, more edits might be necessary. The forms we used to gather feedback are available here: 

- Individual lesson form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1aDub95txBBvwQTdK2_Qwmps3CnGgrDP6u-yUmdLwhoA/edit?usp=sharing
- Overall feedback form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1adPk-0lx0w0-D8fyrONqY5oDFEx2_5aK0CmfGIC52dg/edit?usp=sharing (No responses)

The Sandbox includes files and resources that were begun but not finished. At this stage of the project, it is worth mentioning:
- Lesson 11: Power Up Your Python. This lesson was thought of as a more advanced Python lesson that discussed a variety of techniques that are useful (but not essential to the beginner). This includes a variety of topics, mainly centered around producing efficient code. The file includes some ideas but would need to be written out and researched further.
- Case Studies: These originally were going to be a third part of the course. They are long-form exercises that develop a theme relevant to humanities projects. The files might contain some code but are not very developed.
- Potentially useful datasets: Paintings exhibited at the Paris salons; Shakespeare's Sonnets; the lives of Vasari; poems by Oscar Wilde. 
-Python CheatSheet. Was meant to provide all key statements and structures in one page as a reference to the student.
- Python and Jupyter Installation & a Tour of Jupyter. Were meant as resources for installing and using Python and Jupyter but set aside. Instructions and tutorials are available elsewhere online, so it might not be useful to develop these further.

Regarding the case studies, I originally thought of them as something to be developed by the creator of this project. Researching potential data sets and developing the code, however, is very labor intensive and difficult to do without an outright purpose. It might make more sense to think of these as a way to reinforce concepts and evaluate students' progress. When students begin to use this resource, they could be encouraged to think of a potential project idea (pick from the list of Cases, or think of their own) and invest time in finding a data set. Once they have gone through the lessons, their final project could then be developing one of the cases, either alone or in groups. The instructor could serve as an aid and guide when students get stuck.  Once these projects are completed, these could be accepted (with revisions if necessary) and included in the resource as example files for students and scholars embarking into coding projects.

Finally, there were a few documents that I would have liked to make but did not have the time for. I would have liked to have revisited the exercise in Lesson 7B at the end of all the lessons to take the analysis further and practice creating functions and refactoring code. I also envisioned creating a cheat sheet (some are available online) and a list of further resources.  Regarding the latter, there are a couple of files in the Sandbox that could serve as the beginning for these.

Ultimately, these lessons could be expanded in multiple directions. There are likely many concepts some would consider basic that have not been covered. There is also the potential of expanding in the direction of practical advice for taking coding projects from beginning to end, which goes beyond writing script (something lesson 07B begins to point to). Finally, Eric Monson strongly believes that these lessons could also be filmed as videos for students to follow.
