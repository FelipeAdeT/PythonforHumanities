    "> **Extensible:** The language can be built upon and expanded, resulting in new functionalities \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Object-oriented:** Everything in Python is an object that you perform actions upon.\n",
    "    \n",
    "> **High-level or Human-Readable:** High level languages abstract from the details of machine language, resulting in code that is very easy for a human to read and interpret.', \n",

    ">**Popular:** It is widely used, a sustainable way to develop and share a project.\n",

    "### Use 1: Text Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "'Distant reading', or the search for patterns in large amounts of text, was one of the first areas of development in the digital humanities. Many tools within Python can be used for the purpose of text analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "With Python, we can manipulate texts into formats that are legible by computer, as well as apply different models made for studying the human language, from anything as simple as word frequencies to sophisticated natural language processing techniques such as sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "These models can be used for analyzing text viewed as an end goal, or for developing datasets from textual information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Gothic Colors**\n",
    "\n",
    "Scholars have, for instance, challenged the 'gloomy' reputation of Gothic literature (19th century, think Frankenstein and Dracula) by analyzing and visualizing the uses of color within a corpus of 134 works within the genre. \n",

    "Python is a powerful tool for data gathering. As alluded to before, several tools within Python can be used to transform texts into data. The geoprocessing tools described below can be also used to create spatial data. What is more, Python can be used for **Web Scraping**, to extract information from online sources. It can be used to iterate through documents or records, to edit and clean data. And finally, it provides powerful modules for the analysis and visualization of this data.\n",
