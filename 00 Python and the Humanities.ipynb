    "# Python and the Humanities\n",
    "\n",
    "This resource is intended for humanists interested in learning the programming language Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "You might be coming in with a clear purpose for using Python, or you might be wondering how Python is useful to you. This chapter aims to illustrate how Python is useful in the humanities, and give some key information regarding the resource.\n",

    "---\n",
    "## Lesson Goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define Python\n",
    "- Show uses of Python in the Humanities\n",

    "## What is Python? \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a popular programming language that is...\n",
    "\n",
    "> **General purpose:** It has a wide variety of applications\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Open source:** Code is freely available, not requiring payment\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Extensible:** The language can be built upon and expanded, resulting in new functionalities \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Object-oriented:** Everything in Python is an object that you perform actions upon.\n",
    "    \n",
    "> **High-level or Human-Readable:** High level languages abstract from the details of machine language, resulting in code that is very easy for a human to read and interpret.', \n",
    "\n",
    ">**Popular:** It is widely used, a sustainable way to develop and share a project.\n",
    "\n",
    "These characteristics of Python (open source, object-oriented, high-level, human-readable, popular) make it a great choice for people with little or no prior coding knowledge. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is easy to read and understand, and a lot of code is readily available, which you can reuse and adapt to solve your own problems. \n",

    "## Python Programming and the Humanities\n",
    "\n",
    "The Digital Humanities have spurred an interest in using technology for humanistic inquiry, but many digital humanities projects can be done with out-of-the-box software which requires little programming knowledge. So why learn to code?\n",
    "\n",
    "You might want to learn to program if you want to:\n",
    "- **Expand** the functionalities of preexisting digital tools\n",
    "- **Create** new digital tools\n",
    "- **Automate** repetitive tasks in a large project\n",
    "- **Document** steps in a digital project\n",
    "\n",
    "Python in particular has many potential uses for the humanities, some of which are illustrated here with examples. \n",

    "### Use 1: Text Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "'Distant reading', or the search for patterns in large amounts of text, was one of the first areas of development in the digital humanities. Many tools within Python can be used for the purpose of text analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "With Python, we can manipulate texts into formats that are legible by computer, as well as apply different models made for studying the human language, from anything as simple as word frequencies to sophisticated natural language processing techniques such as sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "These models can be used for analyzing text viewed as an end goal, or for developing datasets from textual information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Gothic Colors**\n",
    "\n",
    "Scholars have, for instance, challenged the 'gloomy' reputation of Gothic literature (19th century, think Frankenstein and Dracula) by analyzing and visualizing the uses of color within a corpus of 134 works within the genre. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project required splitting novels into tokens (single words), identifying which words represented colors by analyzing context, and then counting word frequencies to produce the final visualizations (click on the link below to learn more). \n",

    "### Use 2: Data Gathering, Cleaning, Analysis and Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a powerful tool for data gathering. As alluded to before, several tools within Python can be used to transform texts into data. The geoprocessing tools described below can be also used to create spatial data. What is more, Python can be used for **Web Scraping**, to extract information from online sources. It can be used to iterate through documents or records, to edit and clean data. And finally, it provides powerful modules for the analysis and visualization of this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1: Extracting Illustrated Pages from Digital Libraries with Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "In [one example](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/extracting-illustrated-pages) from _The Programming Historian_, Python was used to identify and download pages with images from collections of books from HathiTrust and the Internet Archive.\n",
    "\n",
    "So they wrote code that took them from this, on a website:\n",

    "<img src=https://programminghistorian.org/images/extracting-illustrated-pages/file-explorer-example.png width=\"400\" >\n",
    "\n",
    "In just a few lines of code, instead of hours of tedious, repetitive (and error-prone) clicking through pages. \n",
    "    \n",
    "**Example 2: Visualizing WWII Data with Bokeh**\n",
    "\n",

    "### Use 3: Python and Mapping \n",
    "\n",
    "The Python language offers several tools that can propel mapping projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geopy** is a Python tool for geocoding with popular services such as Google Maps, Bing, MapBox, and ArcGIS, among others. It can be used to locate the coordinates of addresses, cities, countries, and landmarks across the globe. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Geotext** is a tool for extracting geographical names from text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Python is the scripting language of choice for **ArcGIS Pro**. This application has a native Python window for writing and running scripts. And ESRI has made available **ArcPy**, a module for using ArcGIS' functionalities directly within Python. Through Python, you can automate repetitive workflows, as well as customize ArcGIS tools.\n",

    "### Use 4: Generative Art\n",
    "\n",
    "Artists also use Python to create generative art, or art that is created (at least partially) by an autonomous system. In these cases, code that incorporates a random element or user interactions can be used to create self-generating art pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Processing** is a popular open-source project for coding and the visual arts. While originally released with a Java-based syntax, it now has released a Python mode for making artwork in this language. The examples below illustrate the possibilities of Processing.\n",

    "### Course Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Most resources for teaching python are not geared towards humanities students, but to a broader public that often has a programming background. Thus, they spend considerable time on concepts that will not be central to humanistic research, delivering pay off at a considerable delay. Oftentimes, they teach the structures of the language without giving the tools to piece it together for a practical application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Teach building blocks of Python\n",
    "- Provide functional knowledge applicable to projects\n",
    "- Stress understanding and reuse of existing code\n",
    "- Deliver pay-off early on by:\n",
    "    - Giving practical, project-oriented examples and exercises\n",
    "    - Focus on concepts that will be central to humanistic research\n",
    "- Stimulate an interest in Python through  a first contact with key implementations for the humanities.\n",
    "- Point to resources for further learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Course\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is intended as an independent online resource that does not need a spoken workshop (though it could serve as a resource in one). Students should emerge from this course with a solid understanding of the basics of Python that they can later increment with further training or self-study.\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide notebooks for learning Python basics that include short exercises. At the beginning of the course, exercises are pre-written. Students will modify code to make it work instead of writing it from scratch. As the course advances, students will increasingly work on their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "These lessons are followed by 'cases', longform  practical examples that are relevant to the humanities. Additional notebooks explaining how to install Python and Jupyter Notebooks are also available, as well as a list of resources for further training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Students or teachers can pick notebooks as necessary for a course or project. We cover the standard basics, emphasizing practical needs for humanists, divided into two main sections. Section 1 (Lessons 01-05) provide the building blocks of Python: the knowledge necessary for writing functional Python script. We call section 2 (Lessons 06-10) 'Practical Python,' which gives the basic information necessary for developing your own projects. Order and the emphasis differ from courses with other publics in mind. \n",
