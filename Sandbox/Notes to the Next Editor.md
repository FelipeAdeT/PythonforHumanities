# Notes to the Next Editor

08-10-2020 Felipe Álvarez de Toledo

At this stage, the resource consists of:

- An introductory notebook (00)
- 10 lessons  that teach the building blocks of Python in a way that is hopefully well-suited to the needs of humanities students.
- 7B is a review lesson for lessons 1-7. It is a long-form exercise meant to help consolidate what was learned up to that point. Right now, it is a developed "answer key" to the exercises; a future editor would have to duplicate the document and adapt it so that students can develop their own code.

These lessons have been tested by volunteers and edited accordingly. Extensive edits were also provided by Eric Monson, who was an immense help. As the lessons are tested by more students, more edits might be necessary. The forms we used to gather feedback are available here: 

- Individual lesson form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1aDub95txBBvwQTdK2_Qwmps3CnGgrDP6u-yUmdLwhoA/edit?usp=sharing
- Overall feedback form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1adPk-0lx0w0-D8fyrONqY5oDFEx2_5aK0CmfGIC52dg/edit?usp=sharing (No responses)

The Sandbox includes files and resources that were begun but not finished. At this stage of the project, it is worth several areas where the resource can be expanded. 

**Lesson 11: Power Up Your Python.** This lesson was intended as a more advanced Python lesson that discussed a variety of techniques that are useful, but not essential. This includes a variety of topics, mainly centered around producing more efficient code. The file includes some ideas but would need to be written out and researched further (resources available in the 'Resources for Further Learning' file and below). Topics include:
        - Writing efficient (Fast code)
            - timing code
            - list comprehensions and lambda functions
            - optimizing code
                - code refactoring
                - optimal loops
        - Pythonic writing (style)
        - String formatting

**Case Studies:** These originally were going to be a third part of the course. They are long-form exercises that develop a theme relevant to humanities projects. The files might contain some code but are not very developed.
I originally thought of the case studies as something to be developed by the creator of this project, where students could learn by doing. But this approach was not conducive to teaching the fundaments of Python, and just resulted in confusing lessons. And the amount of work necessary for developing all these cases was not manageable for a single person. Centralizing the creation of all cases is inefficient, requiring a lot of labor and the exploration of many avenues of research (including finding optimal datasets and researching and learning the individual modules for each task). It would be more efficient to decentralize this work as part of a student project that speaks to the student's interests. When students begin to use this resource, they could be encouraged to think of a potential project idea (pick from the list of Cases, or think of their own) and invest time in finding a data set. Once they have gone through the lessons, their final project could then be developing one of the cases, either alone or in groups. The instructor's role would be to serve as a guide and troubleshoot. The development of case studies would then serve as a way to reinforce concepts and evaluate students' progress, and the results could be saved as a database of "case studies" that might serve as a reference and inspiration to other students. 

**Review Lesson after Final Lesson**  I would have liked to create a notebook revisiting the exercise in Lesson 7B to take the analysis further and practice creating functions and refactoring code. 


**Other embrionic documents:** Other documents in the sandbox might be used as the starting point for other projects:
- Potentially useful datasets: Paintings exhibited at the Paris salons; Shakespeare's Sonnets; the lives of Vasari; poems by Oscar Wilde. 
-Python CheatSheet. Was meant to provide all key statements and structures in one page as a reference to the student.
- Python and Jupyter Installation & a Tour of Jupyter. Were meant as resources for installing and using Python and Jupyter but set aside. Instructions and tutorials are available elsewhere online, so it might not be useful to develop these further.


Ultimately, these lessons could be expanded in multiple directions. Eric Monson strongly believes that these lessons could also be filmed as videos for students to follow. Victoria Szabo and Hannah Jacobs have expressed an interest in a video that illustrates some useful applications of Python for the Humanities. And of course, there are many subjects and concepts that this series of lessons does not yet broach.
