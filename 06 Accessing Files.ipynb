    "As with any variable, you can choose which name to assign (here, 'myfile').\n",

    "You must give a string with the filename and filetype, ex. 'data.txt'. If the file is in another directory, you have to specify a filepath.\n",
    "\n",
    "And you can optionally give a mode for opening the file. 'r' will read an existing file. 'w' allows you to write it (create a new file if one with that name does not exist, or write onto an existing file). 'a' allows you to append data to an existing file as new lines. You can also dictate whether a the file is not text but binary format by following the mode with the letter 'b'. \n",
