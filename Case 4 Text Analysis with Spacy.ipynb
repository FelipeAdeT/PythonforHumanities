    "# Named-Entity Recognition with Spacy\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing is a subfield of computer science that provides a broad set of tools for the extraction of information from texts by computational means. In the humanities, the field has proven useful for distant reading, particularly for the study of word frequencies, topic modelling, and sentiment analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several libraries for text analysis with Python. The most well-known are NLTK, the Stanford Core NLP and Spacy. These libraries provide widely-tested toolkits for various NLP processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Spacy has many advantages. Its functionalities are streamlined to deliver results quickly.  By default, the user is not overwhelmed with choices, while simultaneously allowing for user modifications.  Models can be retrained to improve results, and the pipeline (workflow) modified to suit our needs. Moreover, adding new categories to the model is easy.  And finally, they provide several models in multiple languages.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will use the Spacy library to conduct some simple Named-Entity Recognition analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spacy Installation and Import\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Spacy, we need to install their module and the statistical model we wish to use. Everything has been made available for this case study, so no installation is necessary. For future reference, instructions are available here ([spacy installation](https://spacy.io/usage); [model installation](https://spacy.io/usage/models)).\n",

      " Jacopo worked for many years in Rome, or, to be more precise, he lived many years in Rome, working very little. By his hand, in that city, is the first chapel on the right hand as one enters the Church of S. Agostino by the door of the façade; on the vaulting of which chapel are the Apostles receiving the Holy Spirit, and on the wall below are two stories of Christ--in one His taking Peter and Andrew from their nets, and in the other the Feast of Simon and the Magdalene, in which there is a ceiling of planks and beams, counterfeited very well. In the panel of the same chapel, which he painted in oil, is a Dead Christ, wrought and executed with much mastery and diligence. In the Trinità at Rome, likewise, there is a little panel by his hand with the Coronation of Our Lady. But what need is there to say more about this man? What more, indeed, is there to say? It is enough that he loved gossiping as much as he always hated working and painting.\n"
