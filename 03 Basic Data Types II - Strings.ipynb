    "# Working with Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strings** are text data, and are expressed inside single or double quotes. That is, these are equivalent in Python and you can choose between which to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 'text'\n",
    "y = \"text\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Above, both variables have the same content.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few rules derive from the demarcation of strings with quotes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Occasionally you will have text that includes quotes within the string. If you choose to surround your string with double quotes, you can include single quotes within it, and vice versa:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = \"Chicago O'Hare\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Quotes (and other special characters) can also be **escaped** by preceding them with the backslash (\\\\) character.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 'Chicago O\\'Hare'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, if you have a string with backslashes in it (for example, a file directory), you can convert the string into a 'raw string' and void the escape function by preceding the string with the letter r, as shown here:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "r'\\string'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if a string has several lines in it, you must enclose it in triple quotes:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = '''this\n",
    "is\n",
    "one\n",
    "string'''\n",
    "```\n",
