    "Like an if-statement, the **while** statement evaluates a condition. But instead of going through to the next statement in the code, the loop will re-run as long as that condition remains true. This means that we have to program ways for the condition to eventually result in a 'False' output. \n",

    "We will do this through an **iteration variable**, a variable that changes value as the loop progresses and determines the number of iterations in the loop. These often go through a sequence of numbers.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. and continue with other code.\n",
    "\n",
