# Python for the Humanities

To view an interactive version, go to [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/FelipeAdeT/PythonforHumanities/master)

## Course Description

This course imparts the basics of Python for students and scholars working in the humanities. 

The course is focused on teaching a functional knowledge of the building blocks of Python, but is intended to be less code-heavy and more about being able to read code and use and modify preexisting resources. 

It applies a different approach from typical Python lessons by starting with applicable examples and teaching the meaning of code as the student runs into it. This mirrors the way humanists often have to work on projects that use code, progressing and searching for solutions as a project develops.

The examples used are also intended to illustrate the possibilities of coding for the humanities.

## Objectives

The following are the primary learning objectives for students:

1. Explore Humanities applications of Python

1. Spark an interest in programming with Python

1. Learn to read, modify and write basic Python code

1. Lay the foundations and provide tools for further learning 

## Navigating the Content

Clicking on the link to the course on Binder will take you to a docker image of our Github Repository. 

You will see a list of files. You can click on a lesson to begin. 

Lessons are intended to be more content-driven, with exercises that drive home context and basic commands.

Reviews are long-form coding exercises at the end of a section for consolidating knowledge from the lessons in said section.

Cases are long-form coding exercises that provide a workflow for a specific humanities task.

## Installation Requisites

We are using Binder for all materials (slides, worksheets, etc.). Binder provides an online environment so that there is **no need to install** Python or Jupyter.

That being said, you will need to download Python and Jupyter, as well as additional Python modules, for your future work. 

We provide the steps for when you choose to do so in [this notebook](Python,%20Jupyter%20and%20Packages%20Installation.ipynb).
