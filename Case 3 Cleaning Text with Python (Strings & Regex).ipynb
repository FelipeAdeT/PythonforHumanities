      "fresco. Messer Giovanni Bentivogli had caused his palace to be\n",
      "painted by diverse masters of Ferrara and Bologna, and by certain\n",
      "others from Modena; but, having seen Francia's experiments in\n",
      "fresco, he determined that this master should paint a scene on one\n",
      "wall of an apartment that he occupied for his own use. There Francia\n",
      "painted the camp of Holofernes, guarded by various sentinels both on\n",
      "foot and on horseback, who were keeping watch over the pavilions;\n",
      "and the while that they were intent on something else, the sleeping\n",
      "Holofernes was seen surprised by a woman clothed in widow's\n",
      "garments, who, with her left hand, was holding his hair, which was\n",
      "wet with the heat of wine and sleep, and with her right hand she was\n",
      "striking the blow to slay her enemy, the while that an old wrinkled\n",
      "handmaid, with the true air of a most faithful slave, and with her\n",
      "eyes fixed on those of her Judith in order to encourage her, was\n",
      "bending down and holding a basket near the ground, to receive\n",
      "therein the head of the slumbering lover. This scene was one of the\n",
      "most beautiful and most masterly that Francia ever painted, but it\n",
      "was thrown to the ground in the destruction of that edifice at the\n",
      "time of the expulsion of the Bentivogli, together with another scene\n",
      "over that same apartment, coloured to look like bronze, and\n",
      "representing a disputation of philosophers, which was excellently\n",
      "wrought, with his conception very well expressed. These works\n",
      "brought it about that he was loved and honoured by Messer Giovanni\n",
      "and all the members of his house, and, after them, by all the city.\n",

      "In the Chapel of S. Cecilia, which is attached to the Church of S.\n",

      "made the Marriage of Our Lady with Joseph, and in the other the\n",
      "Death of S. Cecilia--a work held in great esteem by the people of\n",
      "Bologna. And, indeed, Francia gained such mastery and such\n",

      "that he desired, that he executed many pictures, of which I will\n",
      "make no mention, it being enough for me to point out, to all who may\n",

      "painting hinder him from carrying on both the Mint and his other\n",
      "work of making medals, as he had done from the beginning. Francia,\n",
      "so it is said, felt the greatest sorrow at the departure of Messer\n",
      "Giovanni Bentivogli, for he had received such great benefits from\n",
      "Messer Giovanni, that it caused him infinite grief; however, like\n",
      "the prudent and orderly man that he was, he kept at his work. After\n",
      "his parting from his patron, he painted three panels that went to\n",
      "Modena, in one of which there was the Baptism of Christ by S. John;\n",
      "in the second, a very beautiful Annunciation; and in the last, which\n",

      "among them many gentlemen of Bologna, eager to see his works. And\n",
      "since it generally comes to pass that every man extols most\n",
      "willingly the intellects of his native place, these Bolognese began\n",
      "to praise the works, the life, and the talents of Francia in the\n",
      "presence of Raffaello, and they established such a friendship\n",

      "Rome for Cardinal Santi Quattro, of the Pucci family, a\n",
      "panel-picture of S. Cecilia, which had to be sent to Bologna to be\n",
      "placed in a chapel of S. Giovanni in Monte, where there is the tomb\n",
      "of the Blessed Elena dall' Olio. This he packed up and addressed to\n",
      "Francia, who, as his friend, was to have it placed on the altar of\n",
      "that chapel, with the ornament, just as he had prepared it himself.\n",
      "Right readily did Francia accept this charge, which gave him a\n",
      "chance of seeing a work by Raffaello, as he had so much desired. And\n",
      "having opened the letter that Raffaello had written to him, in which\n",
      "he besought Francia, if there were any scratch in the work, to put\n",
      "it right, and likewise, as a friend, to correct any error that he\n",
      "might notice, with the greatest joy he had the said panel taken from\n",
      "its case into a good light. But such was the amazement that it\n",
      "caused him, and so great his marvel, that, recognizing his own error\n",
      "and the foolish presumption of his own rash confidence, he took it\n",
      "greatly to heart, and in a very short time died of grief.\n",
      "\n",
      "Raffaello's panel was divine, not so much painted as alive, and so\n",
      "well wrought and coloured by him, that among all the beautiful\n",
      "pictures that he painted while he lived, although they are all\n",
      "miraculous, it could well be called most rare. Wherefore Francia,\n",
      "half dead with terror at the beauty of the picture, which lay before\n",
      "his eyes challenging comparison with those by his own hand that he\n",
      "saw around him, felt all confounded, and had it placed with great\n",
      "diligence in that chapel of S. Giovanni in Monte for which it was\n",
      "destined; and taking to his bed in a few days almost beside himself,\n",
      "thinking that he was now almost of no account in his art in\n",
      "comparison with the opinion held both by himself and by others, he\n",
      "died of grief and melancholy, so some believe, overtaken by the same\n",
      "fate, through contemplating too attentively that most lifelike\n",
      "picture of Raffaello's, as befell Fivizzano from feasting his eyes\n",
      "with his own beautiful Death, about which the following epigram was\n",
      "written:\n",
      "\n",
      "  Me veram pictor divinus mente recepit;\n",
      "    Admota est operi deinde perita manus.\n",

      "However, certain others say that his death was so sudden, that from\n",
      "many symptoms it appeared to be due rather to poison or apoplexy\n",
      "than to anything else. Francia was a prudent man, most regular in\n",
      "his way of life, and very robust. After his death, in the year 1518,\n",

      "But in order that the rise of this craftsman may be better known, let\n",
      "me begin with his origin, and relate that, according to common report,\n",
      "there was born in the city of Perugia, to a poor man of Castello\n",
      "della Pieve, named Cristofano, a son who was baptized with the name of\n",
      "Pietro. This son, brought up amid misery and distress, was given by\n",
      "his father as a shop-boy to a painter of Perugia, who was no great\n",
      "master of his profession, but held in great veneration both the art\n",
      "and the men who were excellent therein; nor did he ever cease to tell\n",
      "Pietro how much gain and honour painting brought to those who\n",
      "practised it well, and he would urge the boy to the study of that art\n",
      "by recounting to him the rewards won by ancient and modern masters;\n",
      "wherefore he fired his mind in such a manner, that Pietro took it into\n",
      "his head to try, if only fortune would assist him, to become one of\n",
      "these. For this reason he was often wont to ask any man whom he knew\n",
      "to have seen the world, in what part the best craftsmen in that\n",
      "calling were formed; particularly his master, who always gave him one\n",
      "and the same answer--namely, that it was in Florence more than in any\n",
      "other place that men became perfect in all the arts, especially in\n",
      "painting, since in that city men are spurred by three things. The\n",
      "first is censure, which is uttered freely and by many, seeing that the\n",
      "air of that city makes men's intellects so free by nature, that they\n",
      "do not content themselves, like a flock of sheep, with mediocre works,\n",
      "but ever consider them with regard to the honour of the good and the\n",
      "beautiful rather than out of respect for the craftsman. The second is\n",
      "that, if a man wishes to live there, he must be industrious, which is\n",
      "naught else than to say that he must continually exercise his\n",
      "intelligence and his judgment, must be ready and adroit in his\n",
      "affairs, and, finally, must know how to make money, seeing that the\n",
      "territory of Florence is not so wide or abundant as to enable her to\n",
      "support at little cost all who live there, as can be done in countries\n",
      "that are rich enough. The third, which is perchance no less potent\n",
      "than the others, is an eager desire for glory and honour, which is\n",
      "generated mightily by that air in the men of all professions; and this\n",
      "desire, in all persons of spirit, will not let them stay content with\n",
      "being equal, much less inferior, to those whom they see to be men like\n",
      "themselves, although they may recognize them as masters--nay, it\n",
      "forces them very often to desire their own advancement so eagerly,\n",
      "that, if they are not kindly or wise by nature, they turn out\n",
      "evil-speakers, ungrateful, and unthankful for benefits. It is true,\n",
      "indeed, that when a man has learnt there as much as suffices him, he\n",
      "must, if he wishes to do more than live from day to day like an\n",
      "animal, and desires to become rich, take his departure from that place\n",
      "and find a sale abroad for the excellence of his works and for the\n",
      "repute conferred on him by that city, as the doctors do with the fame\n",
      "derived from their studies. For Florence treats her craftsmen as time\n",
      "treats its own works, which when perfected, it destroys and consumes\n",
      "little by little.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moved by these counsels, therefore, and by the persuasions of many\n",
      "others, Pietro came to Florence, minded to become excellent; and\n",
      "well did he succeed, for the reason that in those times works in his\n",
      "manner were held in very great price. He studied under the\n",
      "discipline of Andrea Verrocchio, and his first figures were painted\n",
      "without the Porta a Prato, in the Nunnery of S. Martino, now in\n",
      "ruins by reason of the wars. In Camaldoli he made a S. Jerome on a\n",
      "wall, which was then much esteemed by the Florentines and celebrated\n",
      "with great praise, for the reason that he made that Saint old, lean,\n",
      "and emaciated, with his eyes fixed on the Crucifix, and so wasted\n",
      "away, that he seems like an anatomical model, as may be seen from a\n",
      "copy of that picture which is in the hands of the aforesaid\n",
      "Bartolommeo Gondi. In a few years, then, he came into such credit,\n",
      "that his works filled not only Florence and all Italy, but also\n",
      "France, Spain, and many other countries to which they were sent.\n",
      "Wherefore, his paintings being held in very great price and repute,\n",
      "merchants began to buy them up wholesale and to send them abroad to\n",
      "various countries, to their own great gain and profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the Nuns of S. Chiara he painted a Dead Christ on a panel, with\n",
      "such lovely and novel colouring, that he made the craftsmen believe\n",
      "that he would become excellent and marvellous. In this work there\n",
      "are seen some most beautiful heads of old men, and likewise certain\n",
      "figures of the Maries, who, having ceased to weep, are contemplating\n",
      "the Dead Jesus with extraordinary awe and love; not to mention that\n",
      "he made therein a landscape that was then held most beautiful,\n",
      "because the true method of making them, such as it appeared later,\n",
      "had not yet been seen. It is said that Francesco del Pugliese\n",
      "offered to give to the aforesaid nuns three times as much money as\n",
      "they had paid to Pietro, and to have a similar one made for them by\n",
      "the same man's hand, but that they would not consent, because Pietro\n",
      "said that he did not believe he could equal it.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were also many things by the hand of Pietro in the Convent of\n",
      "the Frati Gesuati, without the Porta a Pinti; and since the said\n",
      "church and convent are now in ruins, I do not wish, with this\n",
      "occasion, and before I proceed further with this Life, to grudge the\n",
      "labour of giving some little account of them. This church, then, the\n",
      "architect of which was Antonio di Giorgio of Settignano, was forty\n",
      "braccia long and twenty wide. At the upper end one ascended by four\n",
      "treads, or rather steps, to a platform six braccia in extent, on\n",
      "which stood the high-altar, with many ornaments carved in stone; and\n",
      "on the said altar was a panel with a rich ornament, by the hand, as\n",
      "has been related, of Domenico Ghirlandajo. In the centre of the\n",
      "church was a partition-wall, with a door wrought in open-work from\n",
      "the middle upwards, on either side of which was an altar, while over\n",
      "either altar, as will be told, there stood a panel by the hand of\n",
      "Pietro Perugino. Over the said door was a most beautiful Crucifix by\n",
      "the hand of Benedetto da Maiano, with a Madonna on one side and a S.\n",
      "John on the other, both in relief. Before the said platform of the\n",
      "high-altar, and against the said partition-wall, was a choir of the\n",
      "Doric Order, very well wrought in walnut-wood; and over the\n",
      "principal door of the church there was another choir, which rested\n",
      "on well-strengthened woodwork, with the under part forming a\n",
      "ceiling, or rather soffit, beautifully partitioned, and with a row\n",
      "of balusters acting as parapet to the front of the choir, which\n",
      "faced towards the high-altar. This choir was very convenient to the\n",
      "friars of that convent for holding their night services, for saying\n",
      "their individual prayers, and likewise for week-days. Over the\n",
      "principal door of the church--which was made with most beautiful\n",
      "ornaments of stone, and had a portico in front raised on columns,\n",
      "which made a covered way as far as the door of the convent--was a\n",
      "lunette with a very beautiful figure of S. Giusto, the Bishop, and\n",
      "an angel on either side, by the hand of the illuminator Gherardo;\n",
      "and this because that church was dedicated to the said S. Giusto,\n",
      "and within it those friars preserved a relic of that Saint--that is,\n",
      "an arm. At the entrance of the convent was a little cloister of\n",
      "exactly the same size as the church--namely, forty braccia long and\n",
      "twenty wide--with arches and vaulting going right round and\n",
      "supported by columns of stone, thus making a spacious and most\n",
      "commodious loggia on every side. In the centre of the court of this\n",
      "cloister, which was all neatly paved with squared stone, was a very\n",
      "beautiful well, with a loggia above, which likewise rested on\n",
      "columns of stone, and made a rich and beautiful ornament. In this\n",
      "cloister were the chapter-house of the friars, the side-door of\n",
      "entrance into the church, and the stairs that ascended to the\n",
      "dormitory and other rooms for the use of the friars. On the farther\n",

      "line--that is, the forty braccia of the loggia of the first\n",
      "cloister, the passage, and the line of the second cloister--made a\n",
      "very long enfilade, more beautiful than words can tell, and the\n",
      "rather as from that farther cloister, in the same straight line,\n",
      "there issued a garden-walk two hundred braccia in length; and all\n",
      "this, as one came from the principal door of the convent, made a\n",
      "marvellous view. In the said second cloister was a refectory, sixty\n",
      "braccia long and eighteen wide, with all those well-appointed rooms,\n",
      "and, as the friars call them, offices, which were required in such a\n",
      "convent. Over this was a dormitory in the shape of a =T=, one part\n",
      "of which--namely, the principal part in the direct line, which was\n",
      "sixty braccia long--was double--that is to say, it had cells on\n",
      "either side, and at the upper end, in a space of fifteen braccia,\n",
      "was an oratory, over the altar of which there was a panel by the\n",
      "hand of Pietro Perugino; and over the door of this oratory was\n",
      "another work by the same man's hand, in fresco, as will be told. And\n",
      "on the same floor, above the chapter-house, was a large room where\n",
      "those fathers worked at making glass windows, with the little\n",
      "furnaces and other conveniences that were necessary for such an\n",
      "industry; and since while Pietro lived he made the cartoons for many\n",
      "of their works, those that they executed in his time were all\n",
      "excellent. Then the garden of this convent was so beautiful and so\n",
      "well kept, and the vines were trained round the cloister and in\n",
      "every place with such good order, that nothing better could be seen\n",
      "in the neighbourhood of Florence. In like manner the room wherein\n",
      "they distilled scented waters and medicines, as was their custom,\n",
      "had all the best conveniences that could possibly be imagined. In\n",

      "wrought in so good a manner, that it was judged by the most\n",
      "experienced craftsmen to be the best thing that Pietro ever made. In\n",

      "view receding in perspective, which was much extolled, and rightly,\n",
      "since Pietro made a particular profession of this. In another scene\n",
      "below the first he began a Nativity of Christ, with certain angels\n",
      "and shepherds, wrought with the freshest colouring. And in an arch\n",
      "over the door of the aforesaid oratory he made three half-length\n",
      "figures--Our Lady, S. Jerome, and the Blessed Giovanni--with so\n",

      "works; but he was nevertheless so mean and suspicious that he would\n",
      "never trust Pietro, and always insisted on being present when he was\n",
      "using blue in the work. Wherefore Pietro, who had an honest and\n",
      "upright nature, and had no desire for another man's goods save in\n",
      "return for his own labour, took the Prior's distrust very ill, and\n",
      "resolved to put him to shame; and so, having taken a basin of water,\n",
      "and having laid on the ground for draperies or for anything else that\n",
      "he wished to paint in blue and white, from time to time he caused the\n",
      "Prior, who turned grudgingly to his little bag, to put some\n",
      "ultramarine into the little vase that contained the tempera-water, and\n",
      "then, setting to work, at every second stroke of the brush Pietro\n",
      "would dip his brush in the basin, so that there remained more in the\n",
      "water than he had used on the picture. The Prior, who saw his little\n",
      "bag becoming empty without much to show for it in the work, kept\n",
      "saying time after time: \"Oh, what a quantity of ultramarine this\n",
      "plaster consumes!\" \"Does it not?\" Pietro would answer. After the\n",
      "departure of the Prior, Pietro took the ultramarine from the bottom of\n",

      "painted a panel containing Our Lady and three figures, among which\n",
      "is a S. Sebastian worthy of the highest praise. Now Pietro had done\n",
      "so much work, and he always had so many works in hand, that he would\n",
      "very often use the same subjects; and he had reduced the theory of\n",
      "his art to a manner so fixed, that he made all his figures with the\n",
      "same expression. By that time Michelagnolo Buonarroti had already\n",
      "come to the front, and Pietro greatly desired to see his figures, by\n",
      "reason of the praise bestowed on him by craftsmen; and seeing the\n",
      "greatness of his own name, which he had acquired in every place\n",
      "through so grand a beginning, being obscured, he was ever seeking to\n",
      "wound his fellow-workers with biting words. For this reason, besides\n",
      "certain insults aimed at him by the craftsmen, he had only himself\n",
      "to blame when Michelagnolo told him in public that he was a clumsy\n",
      "fool at his art. But Pietro being unable to swallow such an affront,\n",
      "they both appeared before the Tribunal of Eight, where Pietro came\n",
      "off with little honour. Meanwhile the Servite Friars of Florence,\n",
      "wishing to have the altar-piece of their high-altar painted by some\n",
      "famous master, had handed it over, by reason of the departure of\n",
      "Leonardo da Vinci, who had gone off to France, to Filippino; but he,\n",
      "when he had finished half of one of two panels that were to adorn\n",
      "the altar, passed from this life to the next; wherefore the friars,\n",
      "by reason of the faith that they had in Pietro, entrusted him with\n",
      "the whole work. In that panel, wherein he was painting the\n",
      "Deposition of Christ from the Cross, Filippino had finished the\n",
      "figures of Nicodemus that are taking Him down; and Pietro continued\n",
      "the lower part with the Swooning of the Madonna, and certain other\n",
      "figures. Now this work was to be composed of two panels, one facing\n",
      "towards the choir of the friars, and the other towards the body of\n",
      "the church, and the Deposition from the Cross was to be placed\n",
      "behind, facing the choir, with the Assumption of Our Lady in front;\n",
      "but Pietro made the latter so commonplace, that the Deposition of\n",
      "Christ was placed in front, and the Assumption on the side of the\n",
      "choir. These panels have now been removed, both one and the other,\n",
      "and replaced by the Tabernacle of the Sacrament; they have been set\n",
      "up over certain other altars in that church, and out of the whole\n",
      "work there only remain six pictures, wherein are some saints painted\n",
      "by Pietro in certain niches. It is said that when the work was\n",
      "unveiled, it received no little censure from all the new craftsmen,\n",
      "particularly because Pietro had availed himself of those figures\n",
      "that he had been wont to use in other pictures; with which his\n",
      "friends twitted him, saying that he had taken no pains, and that he\n",
      "had abandoned the good method of working, either through avarice or\n",
      "to save time. To this Pietro would answer: \"I have used the figures\n",
      "that you have at other times praised, and which have given you\n",
      "infinite pleasure; if now they do not please you, and you do not\n",
      "praise them, what can I do?\" But they kept assailing him bitterly\n",
      "with sonnets and open insults; whereupon, although now old, he\n",

      "places in the district of Perugia; more particularly in S. Maria\n",
      "degli Angeli at Assisi, where he painted in fresco a Christ on the\n",

      "high-altar of the Church of S. Pietro, an abbey of Black Friars in\n",

      "To begin with the first, I start by saying that Stefano Veronese, of\n",
      "whom I gave some account in the Life of Agnolo Gaddi, was a painter\n",
      "more than passing good in his day. And when Donatello was working in\n",
      "Padua, as has been already told in his Life, going on one of several\n",
      "occasions to Verona, he was struck with marvel at the works of\n",
      "Stefano, declaring that the pictures which he had made in fresco\n",
      "were the best that had been wrought in those parts up to that time.\n",
      "The first works of this man were in the tramezzo[7] of the Church of\n",
      "S. Antonio at Verona, at the top of a wall on the left, below the\n",
      "curve of a part of the vaulting; and the subjects were a Madonna\n",
      "with the Child in her arms, and S. James and S. Anthony, one on\n",
      "either side of her. This work is held very beautiful in that city\n",
      "even at the present day, by reason of a certain liveliness that is\n",
      "seen in the said figures, particularly in the heads, which are\n",
      "wrought with much grace. In S. Niccolò, a parish church of that\n",
      "city, likewise, he painted a S. Nicholas in fresco, which is very\n",
      "beautiful. On the front of a house in the Via di S. Polo, which\n",
      "leads to the Porta del Vescovo, he painted the Virgin, with certain\n",
      "very beautiful angels and a S. Christopher; and over the wall of the\n",
      "Church of S. Consolata in the Via del Duomo, in a recess made in the\n",
      "wall, he painted a Madonna and certain birds, in particular a\n",
      "peacock, his emblem. In S. Eufemia, a convent of the Eremite Friars\n",
      "of S. Augustine, he painted over the side-door a S. Augustine with\n",
      "two other saints, and under the mantle of this S. Augustine are many\n",
      "friars and nuns of his Order; but the most beautiful things in this\n",
      "work are two half-length prophets of the size of life, for the\n",
      "reason that they have the most beautiful and most lifelike heads\n",
      "that Stefano ever made; and the colouring of the whole work,\n",
      "having been executed with diligence, has remained beautiful even to\n",
      "our own day, notwithstanding that it has been much exposed to rain,\n",
      "wind, and frost. If this work had been under cover, it would still\n",
      "be as beautiful and fresh as it issued from his hands, for the\n",
      "reason that Stefano did not retouch it on the dry, but used\n",
      "diligence in executing it well in fresco; as it is, it has suffered\n",
      "a little. Within the church, in the Chapel of the Sacrament--namely,\n",
      "round the Tabernacle--he afterwards painted certain angels flying,\n",
      "some of whom are sounding instruments, some singing, and others\n",
      "burning incense before the Sacrament; together with a figure of\n",
      "Jesus Christ, which he painted at the top as a finish to the\n",
      "Tabernacle. Below there are other angels, who are supporting Him,\n",
      "clothed in white garments reaching to their feet, and ending, as it\n",
      "were, in clouds, which was an idea peculiar to Stefano in painting\n",
      "figures of angels, whom he always made most gracious in countenance\n",
      "and very beautiful in expression. In this same work are life-size\n",
      "figures of S. Augustine and S. Jerome, one on either side; and these\n",
      "are supporting with their hands the Church of God, as if to show\n",
      "that both of them defend Holy Church from heretics with their\n",
      "learning, and support her. On a pilaster of the principal chapel in\n",
      "the same church he painted a S. Eufemia in fresco, with a beautiful\n",
      "and gracious expression of countenance; and there he wrote his own\n",
      "name in letters of gold, perchance since it appeared to him to be,\n",
      "as in fact it is, one of the best pictures that he had made; and\n",
      "according to his custom he painted there a very beautiful peacock,\n",
      "and beside it two lion cubs, which are not very beautiful, because\n",
      "at that time he could not see live ones, as he saw the peacock. He\n",
      "also painted for the same place a panel containing, as was the\n",
      "custom in those times, many half-length figures, such as S. Niccola\n",
      "da Tolentino and others; and he filled the predella with scenes in\n",
      "little figures from the life of that Saint. In S. Fermo, a church in\n",
      "the same city belonging to the Friars of S. Francis, he painted, as\n",
      "an ornament for a Deposition from the Cross on the wall opposite to\n",
      "the side-door of entrance, twelve half-length prophets of the size\n",
      "of life, with Adam and Eve lying below them, and his usual peacock,\n",

      "contains some pictures in fresco by the hand of the same man. And in\n",
      "the Church of S. Francesco, on the right hand as one enters by the\n",
      "principal door, there is a row of chapels formerly built by the\n",
      "noble Della Ramma family, in one of which are seated figures of the\n",
      "four Evangelists, painted on the vaulting by the hand of Stefano;\n",
      "and behind their shoulders, for a background, he made certain\n",
      "espaliers of roses, with a cane trellis-work in a pattern of\n",
      "mandorle, above which are various trees and other greenery full of\n",
      "birds, particularly of peacocks; and there are also some very\n",
      "beautiful angels. In this same church, on a column on the right hand\n",
      "as one enters, he painted a life-size figure of S. Mary Magdalene.\n",
      "And in the same city, on the frontal of a door in the street called\n",
      "Rompilanza, he painted in fresco a Madonna with the Child in her\n",

      "he could not help it; and so he used to say that doing nothing else\n",

      "nor judgment in such people--and Michelagnolo, who, perchance, had\n",
      "other thoughts in his mind at the time and wished to get rid of him,\n",
      "sent him to buy some figs; and no sooner had Jacopo left the house\n",
      "than Michelagnolo bolted the door behind him, determined not to open\n",
      "to him when he came back. L'Indaco, then, on returning from the\n",
      "market-square, perceived, after having knocked at the door for a\n",
      "time in vain, that Michelagnolo did not intend to open to him;\n",
      "whereupon, flying into a rage, he took the figs and the leaves and\n",
      "spread them all over the threshold of the door. This done, he went\n",
      "his way and for many months refused to speak to Michelagnolo; but at\n",
      "last, becoming reconciled with him, he was more his friend than\n",

      "Father in Heaven surrounded by many angels in the form of children.\n",

      "although only with art and difficulty, to appear alive. He was a\n",
      "pupil and disciple of Piero dal Borgo a San Sepolcro, and greatly\n",
      "did he strive in his youth to imitate his master, and even to\n",
      "surpass him; and the while that he was working with Piero at Arezzo,\n",
      "living in the house of his uncle Lazzaro Vasari, as it has been\n",
      "told, he imitated the manner of the said Piero so well that the one\n",
      "could scarcely be distinguished from the other.\n",

      "The first works of Luca were in S. Lorenzo at Arezzo, where he\n",
      "painted the Chapel of S. Barbara in fresco in the year 1472; and he\n",
      "painted for the Company of S. Caterina, on cloth and in oil, the\n",
      "banner that is borne in processions, and likewise that of the\n",
      "Trinità, although this does not appear to be by the hand of Luca,\n",
      "but by Piero dal Borgo himself. In S. Agostino in the same city he\n",
      "painted the panel of S. Niccola da Tolentino, with most beautiful\n",
      "little scenes, executing the work with good drawing and invention;\n",
      "and in the same place, in the Chapel of the Sacrament, he made two\n",
      "angels wrought in fresco. In the Chapel of the Accolti in the Church\n",
      "of S. Francesco, for Messer Francesco, Doctor of Laws, he painted a\n",
      "panel in which he portrayed the said Messer Francesco with some of\n",
      "his relatives. In this work is a S. Michael weighing souls, who is\n",
      "admirable; and in him there is seen the knowledge of Luca, both in\n",
      "the splendour of his armour and in the reflected lights, and, in\n",
      "short, throughout the whole work. In his hands he placed a pair of\n",
      "scales, in which are nude figures, very beautifully foreshortened,\n",
      "one going up and the other down; and among other ingenious things\n",
      "that are in this picture is a nude figure most skilfully transformed\n",
      "into a devil, with a lizard licking the blood from a wound in its\n",

      "with S. Stephen, S. Laurence, S. Catherine, and two angels, of whom\n",
      "one is playing on a lute and the other on a rebec; and all these\n",
      "figures are draped and adorned so beautifully that it is a marvel.\n",
      "But the most miraculous part of this panel is the predella, which is\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Truly great was the advancement conferred on the arts of\n",
      "architecture, painting, and sculpture by those excellent masters of\n",
      "whom we have written hitherto, in the Second Part of these Lives,\n",
      "for to the achievements of the early masters they added rule, order,\n",
      "proportion, draughtsmanship, and manner; not, indeed, in complete\n",
      "perfection, but with so near an approach to the truth that the\n",
      "masters of the third age, of whom we are henceforward to speak, were\n",
      "enabled, by means of their light, to aspire still higher and attain\n",
      "to that supreme perfection which we see in the most highly prized\n",
      "and most celebrated of our modern works. But to the end that the\n",
      "nature of the improvement brought about by the aforesaid craftsmen\n",
      "may be even more clearly understood, it will certainly not be out of\n",
      "place to explain in a few words the five additions that I have\n",
      "named, and to give a succinct account of the origin of that true\n",
      "excellence which, having surpassed the age of the ancients, makes\n",
      "the modern so glorious.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rule, then, in architecture, was the process of taking measurements\n",
      "from antiquities and studying the ground-plans of ancient edifices\n",
      "for the construction of modern buildings. Order was the separating\n",
      "of one style from another, so that each body should receive its\n",
      "proper members, with no more interchanging between Doric, Ionic,\n",
      "Corinthian, and Tuscan. Proportion was the universal law applying\n",
      "both to architecture and to sculpture, that all bodies should be\n",
      "made correct and true, with the members in proper harmony; and so,\n",
      "also, in painting. Draughtsmanship was the imitation of the most\n",
      "beautiful parts of nature in all figures, whether in sculpture or in\n",
      "painting; and for this it is necessary to have a hand and a brain\n",
      "able to reproduce with absolute accuracy and precision, on a level\n",
      "surface--whether by drawing on paper, or on panel, or on some other\n",
      "level surface--everything that the eye sees; and the same is true of\n",
      "relief in sculpture. Manner then attained to the greatest beauty\n",
      "from the practice which arose of constantly copying the most\n",
      "beautiful objects, and joining together these most beautiful things,\n",
      "hands, heads, bodies, and legs, so as to make a figure of the\n",
      "greatest possible beauty. This practice was carried out in every\n",
      "work for all figures, and for that reason it is called the beautiful\n",
      "manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "These things had not been done by Giotto or by the other early\n",
      "craftsmen, although they had discovered the rudiments of all these\n",
      "difficulties, and had touched them on the surface; as in their\n",
      "drawing, which was sounder and more true to nature than it had been\n",
      "before, and likewise in harmony of colouring and in the grouping of\n",
      "figures in scenes, and in many other respects of which enough has\n",
      "been said. Now although the masters of the second age improved our\n",
      "arts greatly with regard to all the qualities mentioned above, yet\n",
      "these were not made by them so perfect as to succeed in attaining to\n",
      "complete perfection, for there was wanting in their rule a certain\n",
      "freedom which, without being of the rule, might be directed by the\n",
      "rule and might be able to exist without causing confusion or\n",
      "spoiling the order; which order had need of an invention abundant in\n",
      "every respect, and of a certain beauty maintained in every least\n",
      "detail, so as to reveal all that order with more adornment. In\n",
      "proportion there was wanting a certain correctness of judgment, by\n",
      "means of which their figures, without having been measured, might\n",
      "have, in due relation to their dimensions, a grace exceeding\n",
      "measurement. In their drawing there was not the perfection of\n",
      "finish, because, although they made an arm round and a leg straight,\n",
      "the muscles in these were not revealed with that sweet and facile\n",
      "grace which hovers midway between the seen and the unseen, as is the\n",
      "case with the flesh of living figures; nay, they were crude and\n",
      "excoriated, which made them displeasing to the eye and gave hardness\n",
      "to the manner. This last was wanting in the delicacy that comes from\n",
      "making all figures light and graceful, particularly those of women\n",
      "and children, with the limbs true to nature, as in the case of men,\n",
      "but veiled with a plumpness and fleshiness that should not be\n",
      "awkward, as they are in nature, but refined by draughtsmanship and\n",
      "judgment. They also lacked our abundance of beautiful costumes, our\n",
      "great number and variety of bizarre fancies, loveliness of\n",
      "colouring, wide knowledge of buildings, and distance and variety in\n",
      "landscapes. And although many of them, such as Andrea Verrocchio and\n",
      "Antonio del Pollaiuolo, and many others more modern, began to seek\n",
      "to make their figures with more study, so as to reveal in them\n",
      "better draughtsmanship, with a degree of imitation more correct and\n",
      "truer to nature, nevertheless the whole was not yet there, even\n",
      "though they had one very certain assurance--namely, that they were\n",
      "advancing towards the good, and their figures were thus approved\n",
      "according to the standard of the works of the ancients, as was seen\n",
      "when Andrea Verrocchio restored in marble the legs and arms of the\n",
      "Marsyas in the house of the Medici in Florence. But they lacked a\n",
      "certain finish and finality of perfection in the feet, hands, hair,\n",
      "and beards, although the limbs as a whole are in accordance with the\n",
      "antique and have a certain correct harmony in the proportions. Now\n",
      "if they had had that minuteness of finish which is the perfection\n",
      "and bloom of art, they would also have had a resolute boldness in\n",
      "their works; and from this there would have followed delicacy,\n",
      "refinement, and supreme grace, which are the qualities produced by\n",
      "the perfection of art in beautiful figures, whether in relief or in\n",
      "painting; but these qualities they did not have, although they give\n",
      "proof of diligent striving. That finish, and that certain something\n",
      "that they lacked, they could not achieve so readily, seeing that\n",
      "study, when it is used in that way to obtain finish, gives dryness\n",
      "to the manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "After them, indeed, their successors were enabled to attain to it\n",
      "through seeing excavated out of the earth certain antiquities cited\n",
      "by Pliny as amongst the most famous, such as the Laocoon, the\n",
      "Hercules, the Great Torso of the Belvedere, and likewise the Venus,\n",
      "the Cleopatra, the Apollo, and an endless number of others, which,\n",
      "both with their sweetness and their severity, with their fleshy\n",
      "roundness copied from the greatest beauties of nature, and with\n",
      "certain attitudes which involve no distortion of the whole figure\n",
      "but only a movement of certain parts, and are revealed with a most\n",
      "perfect grace, brought about the disappearance of a certain dryness,\n",
      "hardness, and sharpness of manner, which had been left to our art by\n",
      "the excessive study of Piero della Francesca, Lazzaro Vasari, Alesso\n",
      "Baldovinetti, Andrea dal Castagno, Pesello, Ercole Ferrarese,\n",
      "Giovanni Bellini, Cosimo Rosselli, the Abbot of S. Clemente,\n",
      "Domenico del Ghirlandajo, Sandro Botticelli, Andrea Mantegna,\n",
      "Filippo, and Luca Signorelli. These masters sought with great\n",
      "efforts to do the impossible in art by means of labour, particularly\n",
      "in foreshortenings and in things unpleasant to the eye, which were\n",
      "as painful to see as they were difficult for them to execute. And\n",
      "although their works were for the most part well drawn and free from\n",
      "errors, yet there was wanting a certain resolute spirit which was\n",
      "never seen in them, and that sweet harmony of colouring which the\n",
      "Bolognese Francia and Pietro Perugino first began to show in their\n",

      "overcoming of difficulties, that it is not possible ever to see\n",

      "such a variety of things, he never ceased drawing and working in\n",
      "relief, pursuits which suited his fancy more than any other. Ser\n",
      "Piero, having observed this, and having considered the loftiness of\n",

      "plaster casts are still taken, and likewise some heads of boys which\n",
      "appeared to have issued from the hand of a master; but in\n",
      "architecture, also, he made many drawings both of ground-plans and\n",
      "of other designs of buildings; and he was the first, although but a\n",
      "youth, who suggested the plan of reducing the river Arno to a\n",
      "navigable canal from Pisa to Florence. He made designs of\n",
      "flour-mills, fulling-mills, and engines, which might be driven by\n",
      "the force of water: and since he wished that his profession should\n",
      "be painting, he studied much in drawing after nature, and sometimes\n",
      "in making models of figures in clay, over which he would lay soft\n",
      "pieces of cloth dipped in clay, and then set himself patiently to\n",
      "draw them on a certain kind of very fine Rheims cloth, or prepared\n",
      "linen: and he executed them in black and white with the point of his\n",
      "brush, so that it was a marvel, as some of them by his hand, which I\n",

      "that served it, and he knew so well how to express his conceptions\n",
      "by draughtsmanship, that he vanquished with his discourse, and\n",
      "confuted with his reasoning, every valiant wit. And he was\n",
      "continually making models and designs to show men how to remove\n",
      "mountains with ease, and how to bore them in order to pass from one\n",
      "level to another; and by means of levers, windlasses, and screws, he\n",

      "these ideas and labours many drawings may be seen, scattered abroad\n",

      "taking them with his own hand out of their cages, and having paid to\n",
      "those who sold them the price that was asked, he let them fly away\n",
      "into the air, restoring to them their lost liberty. For which\n",

      "['FILIPPO LIPPI, CALLED FILIPPINO\\nPAINTER OF FLORENCE\\nThere was at this same time in Florence a painter of most beautiful\\nintelligence and most lovely invention, namely, Filippo, son of Fra\\nFilippo of the Carmine, who, following in the steps of his dead\\nfather in the art of painting, was brought up and instructed, being\\nstill very young, by Sandro Botticelli, notwithstanding that his\\nfather had commended him on his death-bed to Fra Diamante, who was\\nmuch his friend--nay, almost his brother. Such was the intelligence\\nof Filippo, and so abundant his invention in painting, and so\\nbizarre and new were his ornaments, that he was the first who showed\\nto the moderns the new method of giving variety to vestments, and\\nembellished and adorned his figures with the girt-up garments of\\nantiquity. He was also the first to bring to light grotesques, in\\nimitation of the antique, and he executed them on friezes in\\nterretta or in colours, with more design and grace than the men\\nbefore him had shown; wherefore it was a marvellous thing to see the\\nstrange fancies that he expressed in painting. What is more, he\\nnever executed a single work in which he did not avail himself with\\ngreat diligence of Roman antiquities, such as vases, buskins,\\ntrophies, banners, helmet-crests, adornments of temples, ornamental\\nhead-dresses, strange kinds of draperies, armour, scimitars, swords,\\ntogas, mantles, and such a variety of other beautiful things, that\\nwe owe him a very great and perpetual obligation, seeing that he\\nadded beauty and adornment to art in this respect.\\nIn his earliest youth he completed the Chapel of the Brancacci in\\nthe Carmine at Florence, begun by Masolino, and left not wholly\\nfinished by Masaccio on account of his death. Filippo, therefore,\\ngave it its final perfection with his own hand, and executed what\\nwas lacking in one scene, wherein S. Peter and S. Paul are restoring\\nto life the nephew of the Emperor. In the nude figure of this boy he\\nportrayed the painter Francesco Granacci, then a youth; and he also\\nmade portraits of the Chevalier, Messer Tommaso Soderini, Piero\\nGuicciardini, father of Messer Francesco the historian, Piero del\\nPugliese, and the poet Luigi Pulci; likewise Antonio Pollaiuolo, and\\nhimself as a youth, as he then was, which he never did again\\nthroughout the whole of his life, so that it has not been possible\\nto find a portrait of him at a more mature age. In the scene\\nfollowing this he portrayed Sandro Botticelli, his master, and many\\nother friends and people of importance; among others, the broker\\nRaggio, a man of great intelligence and wit, who executed in relief\\non a conch the whole Inferno of Dante, with all the circles and\\ndivisions of the pits and the nethermost well in their exact\\nproportions, and all the figures and details that were most\\ningeniously imagined and described by that great poet; which conch\\nwas held in those times to be a marvellous thing.\\nNext, in the Chapel of Francesco del Pugliese at Campora, a seat of\\nthe Monks of the Badia, without Florence, he painted a panel in\\ndistemper of S. Bernard, to whom Our Lady is appearing with certain\\nangels, while he is writing in a wood; which picture is held to be\\nadmirable in certain respects, such as rocks, books, herbage, and\\nsimilar things, that he painted therein, besides the portrait from\\nlife of Francesco himself, so excellent that he seems to lack\\nnothing save speech. This panel was removed from that place on\\naccount of the siege, and placed for safety in the Sacristy of the\\nBadia of Florence. In S. Spirito in the same city, for Tanai de\\'\\nNerli, he painted a panel with Our Lady, S. Martin, S. Nicholas, and\\nS. Catherine; with a panel in the Chapel of the Rucellai in S.\\nPancrazio, and a Crucifix and two figures on a ground of gold in S.\\nRaffaello. In front of the Sacristy of S. Francesco, without the\\nPorta a S. Miniato, he made a God the Father, with a number of\\nchildren. At Palco, a seat of the Frati del Zoccolo, without Prato,\\nhe painted a panel; and in the Audience Chamber of the Priori in\\nthat territory he executed a little panel containing the Madonna, S.\\nStephen, and S. John the Baptist, which has been much extolled. On\\nthe Canto al Mercatale, also in Prato, in a shrine opposite to the\\nNuns of S. Margherita, and near some houses belonging to them, he\\npainted in fresco a very beautiful Madonna, with a choir of\\nseraphim, on a ground of dazzling light. In this work, among other\\nthings, he showed art and beautiful judgment in a dragon that is at\\nthe feet of S. Margaret, which is so strange and horrible, that it\\nis revealed to us as a true fount of venom, fire, and death; and the\\nwhole of the rest of the work is so fresh and vivacious in\\ncolouring, that it deserves infinite praise.\\nHe also wrought certain things in Lucca, particularly a panel in a\\nchapel of the Church of S. Ponziano, which belongs to the Monks of\\nMonte Oliveto; in the centre of which chapel there is a niche\\ncontaining a very beautiful S. Anthony in relief by the hand of\\nAndrea Sansovino, a most excellent sculptor. Being invited to go to\\nHungary by King Matthias, Filippo refused, but made up for this by\\npainting two very beautiful panels for that King in Florence, and\\nsending them to him; and in one of these he made a portrait of the\\nKing, taken from his likeness on medals. He also sent certain works\\nto Genoa; and beside the Chapel of the High-Altar in S. Domenico at\\nBologna, on the left hand, he painted a S. Sebastian on a panel,\\nwhich was a thing worthy of much praise. For Tanai de\\' Nerli he\\nexecuted another panel in S. Salvadore, without Florence; and for\\nhis friend Piero del Pugliese he painted a scene with little\\nfigures, executed with so much art and diligence that when another\\ncitizen besought him to make a second like it, he refused, saying\\nthat it was not possible to do it.\\nAfter these things he executed a very great work in Rome for the\\nNeapolitan Cardinal, Olivieri Caraffa, at the request of the elder\\nLorenzo de\\' Medici, who was a friend of that Cardinal. While going\\nthither for that purpose, he passed through Spoleto at the wish of\\nLorenzo, in order to give directions for the making of a marble tomb\\nfor his father Fra Filippo at the expense of Lorenzo, who had not\\nbeen able to obtain his body from the people of Spoleto for removal\\nto Florence. Filippo, therefore, made a beautiful design for the\\nsaid tomb, and Lorenzo had it erected after that design (as has\\nbeen told in another place), sumptuous and beautiful. Afterwards,\\nhaving arrived in Rome, Filippo painted a chapel in the Church of\\nthe Minerva for the said Cardinal Caraffa, depicting therein scenes\\nfrom the life of S. Thomas Aquinas, and certain most beautiful\\npoetical compositions ingeniously imagined by himself, for he had a\\nnature ever inclined to this. In the scene, then, wherein Faith has\\ntaken Infidelity captive, there are all the heretics and infidels.\\nHope has likewise overcome Despair, and so, too, there are many\\nother Virtues that have subjugated the Vice that is their opposite.\\nIn a disputation is S. Thomas defending the Church \"ex cathedra\"\\nagainst a school of heretics, and holding vanquished beneath him\\nSabellius, Arius, Averroes, and others, all clothed in graceful\\ngarments; of which scene we have in our book of drawings the\\noriginal design by Filippo\\'s own hand, with certain others by the\\nsame man, wrought with such mastery that they could not be bettered.\\nThere, too, is the scene when, as S. Thomas is praying, the Crucifix\\nsays to him, \"Bene scripsisti de me, Thoma\"; while a companion of\\nthe Saint, hearing that Crucifix thus speaking, is standing amazed\\nand almost beside himself. In the panel is the Virgin receiving the\\nAnnunciation from Gabriel; and on the main wall there is her\\nAssumption into Heaven, with the twelve Apostles round the\\nsepulchre. The whole of this work was held, as it still is, to be\\nvery excellent and wrought perfectly for a work in fresco. It\\ncontains a portrait from life of the said Cardinal Olivieri Caraffa,\\nBishop of Ostia, who was buried in this chapel in the year 1511, and\\nafterwards removed to the Piscopio in Naples.\\nHaving returned to Florence, Filippo undertook to paint at his\\nleisure the Chapel of the elder Filippo Strozzi in S. Maria Novella,\\nand he actually began it; but, having finished the ceiling, he was\\ncompelled to return to Rome, where he wrought a tomb with\\nstucco-work for the said Cardinal, and decorated with gesso a little\\nchapel beside that tomb in a part of the same Church of the Minerva,\\ntogether with certain figures, some of which were executed by his\\ndisciple, Raffaellino del Garbo. The chapel described above was\\nvalued by Maestro Lanzilago of Padua and by the Roman Antonio, known\\nas Antoniasso, two of the best painters that were then in Rome,\\nat 2,000 ducats of gold, without the cost of the blues and of the\\nassistants. Having received this sum, Filippo returned to Florence,\\nwhere he finished the aforesaid Chapel of the Strozzi, which was\\nexecuted so well, and with so much art and design, that it causes\\nall who see it to marvel, by reason of the novelty and variety of\\nthe bizarre things that are seen therein--armed men, temples, vases,\\nhelmet-crests, armour, trophies, spears, banners, garments, buskins,\\nhead-dresses, sacerdotal vestments, and other things--all executed\\nin so beautiful a manner that they deserve the highest commendation.\\nIn this work there is the scene of Drusiana being restored to life\\nby S. John the Evangelist, wherein we see most admirably expressed\\nthe marvel of the bystanders at beholding a man restore life to a\\ndead woman by a mere sign of the cross; and the greatest amazement\\nof all is seen in a priest, or rather philosopher, whichever he may\\nbe, who is clothed in ancient fashion and has a vase in his hand. In\\nthe same scene, likewise, among a number of women draped in various\\nmanners, there is a little boy, who, terrified by a small spaniel\\nspotted with red, which has seized him with its teeth by one of his\\nswathing-bands, is running round his mother and hiding himself among\\nher clothes, and appears to be as much afraid of being bitten by the\\ndog as his mother is awestruck and filled with a certain horror at\\nthe resurrection of Drusiana. Next to this, in the scene where S.\\nJohn himself is being boiled in oil, we see the wrath of the judge,\\nwho is giving orders for the fire to be increased, and the flames\\nreflected on the face of the man who is blowing at them; and all the\\nfigures are painted in beautiful and varied attitudes. On the other\\nside is S. Philip in the Temple of Mars, compelling the serpent,\\nwhich has slain the son of the King with its stench, to come forth\\nfrom below the altar. In certain steps the painter depicted the hole\\nthrough which the serpent issued from beneath the altar, and so well\\ndid he paint the cleft in one of the steps, that one evening one of\\nFilippo\\'s lads, wishing to hide something, I know not what, from the\\nsight of someone who was knocking for admittance, ran up in haste in\\norder to conceal it in the hole, being wholly deceived by it.\\nFilippo also showed so much art in the serpent, that its venom,\\nfetid breath, and fire, appear rather real than painted. Greatly\\nextolled, too, is his invention in the scene of the Crucifixion of\\nthat Saint, for he imagined to himself, so it appears, that the\\nSaint was stretched on the cross while it lay on the ground, and\\nthat afterwards the whole was drawn up and raised on high by means\\nof ropes, cords, and poles; which ropes and cords are wound round\\ncertain fragments of antiquities, pieces of pillars, and bases, and\\npulled by certain ministers. On the other side the weight of the\\nsaid cross and of the Saint who is stretched nude thereon is\\nsupported by two men, on the one hand by a man with a ladder, with\\nwhich he is propping it up, and on the other hand by another with a\\npole, upholding it, while two others, setting a lever against the\\nbase and stem of the cross, are balancing its weight and seeking to\\nplace it in the hole made in the ground, wherein it had to stand\\nupright. But why say more? It would not be possible for the work to\\nbe better either in invention or in drawing, or in any other respect\\nwhatsoever of industry or art. Besides this, it contains many\\ngrotesques and other things wrought in chiaroscuro to resemble\\nmarble, executed in strange fashion with invention and most\\nbeautiful drawing.\\nFor the Frati Scopetini, also, at S. Donato, without Florence, which\\nis called Scopeto and is now in ruins, he painted a panel with the\\nMagi presenting their offerings to Christ, finished with great\\ndiligence, wherein he portrayed the elder Pier Francesco de\\' Medici,\\nson of Lorenzo di Bicci, in the figure of an astrologer who is\\nholding a quadrant in his hand, and likewise Giovanni, father of\\nSignor Giovanni de\\' Medici, and another Pier Francesco, brother of\\nthat Signor Giovanni, and other people of distinction. In this work\\nare Moors, Indians, costumes of strange shapes, and a most bizarre\\nhut. In a loggia at Poggio a Cajano he began a Sacrifice in fresco\\nfor Lorenzo de\\' Medici, but it remained unfinished. And for the\\nNunnery of S. Geronimo, above the Costa di S. Giorgio in Florence,\\nhe began the panel of the high-altar, which was brought nearly to\\ncompletion after his death by the Spaniard Alonzo Berughetta, but\\nafterwards wholly finished by other painters, Alonzo having gone to\\nSpain. In the Palazzo della Signoria he painted the panel of the\\nhall where the Council of Eight held their sittings, and he made the\\ndesign for another large panel, with its ornament, for the Sala\\ndel Consiglio; which design his death prevented him from beginning\\nto put into execution, although the ornament was carved; which\\nornament is now in the possession of Maestro Baccio Baldini, a most\\nexcellent physician of Florence, and a lover of every sort of\\ntalent. For the Church of the Badia of Florence he made a very\\nbeautiful S. Jerome; and he began a Deposition from the Cross for\\nthe high-altar of the Friars of the Nunziata, but only finished the\\nfigures in the upper half of the picture, for, being overcome by a\\nmost cruel fever and by that contraction of the throat that is\\ncommonly known as quinsy, he died in a few days at the age of\\nforty-five.\\nThereupon, having ever been courteous, affable, and kindly, he was\\nlamented by all those who had known him, and particularly by the\\nyouth of his noble native city, who, in their public festivals,\\nmasques, and other spectacles, ever availed themselves, to their\\ngreat satisfaction, of the ingenuity and invention of Filippo, who\\nhas never had an equal in things of that kind. Nay, he was so\\nexcellent in all his actions, that he blotted out the stain (if\\nstain it was) left to him by his father--blotted it out, I say, not\\nonly by the excellence of his art, wherein he was inferior to no man\\nof his time, but also by the modesty and regularity of his life,\\nand, above all, by his courtesy and amiability; and how great are\\nthe force and power of such qualities to conciliate the minds of all\\nmen without exception, is only known to those who either have\\nexperienced or are experiencing it. Filippo was buried by his sons\\nin S. Michele Bisdomini, on April 13, 1505; and while he was being\\nborne to his tomb all the shops in the Via de\\' Servi were closed, as\\nis done sometimes for the obsequies of great men.\\nAmong the disciples of Filippo, who all failed by a great measure to\\nequal him, was Raffaellino del Garbo, who made many works, as will\\nbe told in the proper place, although he did not justify the\\nopinions and hopes that were conceived of him while Filippo was\\nalive and Raffaellino himself still a young man. The fruits, indeed,\\nare not always equal to the blossoms that are seen in the spring.\\nNor did any great success come to Niccolò Zoccolo, otherwise known\\nas Niccolò Cartoni, who was likewise a disciple of Filippo, and\\npainted at Arezzo the wall that is over the altar of S. Giovanni\\nDecollato; a little panel, passing well done, in S. Agnesa; a panel\\nover a lavatory in the Abbey of S. Fiora, containing a Christ who is\\nasking for water from the woman of Samaria; and many other works,\\nwhich, since they were commonplace, are not mentioned.', \"BERNARDINO PINTURICCHIO\\nPAINTER OF PERUGIA\\nEven as many are assisted by fortune without being endowed with much\\ntalent, so, on the contrary, there is an infinite number of able men\\nwho are persecuted by an adverse and hostile fortune; whence it is\\nclearly manifest that she acknowledges as her children those who\\ndepend upon her without the aid of any talent, since it pleases her\\nto exalt by her favour certain men who would never be known through\\ntheir own merit; which is seen in Pinturicchio of Perugia, who,\\nalthough he made many works and was assisted by various helpers,\\nnevertheless had a much greater name than his works deserved.\\nHowever, he was a man who had much practice in large works, and ever\\nkept many assistants to aid him in his labours. Now, having worked\\nat many things in his early youth under his master Pietro da\\nPerugia, receiving a third of all that was earned, he was\\nsummoned to Siena by Cardinal Francesco Piccolomini to paint the\\nlibrary made by Pope Pius II in the Duomo of that city. It is true,\\nindeed, that the sketches and cartoons for all the scenes that he\\npainted there were by the hand of Raffaello da Urbino, then a youth,\\nwho had been his companion and fellow-disciple under the same\\nPietro, whose manner the said Raffaello had mastered very well. One\\nof these cartoons is still to be seen at the present day in Siena,\\nand some of the sketches, by the hand of Raffaello, are in our book.\\nNow the stories in this work, wherein Pinturicchio was aided by many\\npupils and assistants, all of the school of Pietro, were divided\\ninto ten pictures. In the first is painted the scene when the said\\nPope Pius II was born to Silvio Piccolomini and Vittoria, and was\\ncalled Æneas, in the year 1405, in Valdorcia, at the township of\\nCorsignano, which is now called Pienza after the name of that Pope,\\nwho afterwards enriched it with buildings and made it a city; and in\\nthis picture are portraits from nature of the said Silvio and\\nVittoria. In the same is the scene when, in company with Cardinal\\nDomenico of Capranica, he is crossing the Alps, which are covered\\nwith ice and snow, on his way to the Council of Bâle. In the second\\nthe Council is sending Æneas on many embassies--namely, to Argentina\\n(three times), to Trent, to Constance, to Frankfurt, and to Savoy.\\nIn the third is the sending of the same Æneas by the Antipope Felix\\nas ambassador to the Emperor Frederick III, with whom the ready\\nintelligence, the eloquence, and the grace of Æneas found so much\\nfavour that he was given the poet's crown of laurel by Frederick\\nhimself, who made him his Protonotary, received him into the number\\nof his friends, and appointed him his First Secretary. In the fourth\\nhe is sent by Frederick to Eugenius IV, by whom he was made Bishop\\nof Trieste, and then Archbishop of Siena, his native city. In the\\nfifth scene the same Emperor, who is about to come to Italy to\\nreceive the crown of Empire, is sending Æneas to Telamone, a port of\\nthe people of Siena, to meet his wife, Leonora, who was coming from\\nPortugal. In the sixth Æneas is going to Calistus IV, at the\\nbidding of the said Emperor, to induce him to make war against the\\nTurks; and in this part, Siena being harassed by the Count of\\nPittigliano and by others at the instigation of King Alfonso of\\nNaples, that Pontiff is sending him to treat for peace. This\\neffected, war is planned against the Orientals; and he, having\\nreturned to Rome, is made a Cardinal by the said Pontiff. In the\\nseventh, Calistus being dead, Æneas is seen being created Supreme\\nPontiff, and called Pius II. In the eighth the Pope goes to Mantua\\nfor the Council about the expedition against the Turks, where the\\nMarquis Lodovico receives him with most splendid pomp and incredible\\nmagnificence. In the ninth the same Pope is placing in the catalogue\\nof saints--or, as the saying is, canonizing--Catherine of Siena, a\\nholy woman and nun of the Preaching Order. In the tenth and last,\\nwhile preparing a vast expedition against the Turks with the help\\nand favour of all the Christian Princes, Pope Pius dies at\\nAncona; and a hermit of the Hermitage of Camaldoli, a holy man, sees\\nthe soul of the said Pontiff being borne by Angels into Heaven at\\nthe very moment of his death, as may also be read. Afterwards, in\\nthe same picture, the body of the same Pope is seen being borne from\\nAncona to Rome by a vast and honourable company of lords and\\nprelates, who are lamenting the death of so great a man and so rare\\nand holy a Pontiff. The whole of this work is full of portraits from\\nthe life, so numerous that it would be a long story to recount their\\nnames; and it is all painted with the finest and most lively\\ncolours, and wrought with various ornaments of gold, and with very\\nwell designed partitions in the ceiling. Below each scene is a Latin\\ninscription, which describes what is contained therein. In the\\ncentre of this library the said Cardinal Francesco Piccolomini,\\nnephew of the Pope, placed the three Graces of marble, ancient and\\nmost beautiful, which are still there, and which were the first\\nantiquities to be held in price in those times. This library,\\nwherein are all the books left by the said Pius II, was scarcely\\nfinished, when the same Cardinal Francesco, nephew of the aforesaid\\nPontiff, Pius II, was created Pope, choosing the name of Pius III in\\nmemory of his uncle. Over the door of that library, which opens into\\nthe Duomo, the same Pinturicchio painted in a very large scene,\\noccupying the whole extent of the wall, the Coronation of the said\\nPope Pius III, with many portraits from life; and beneath it may be\\nread these words:\\n     PIUS III SENENSIS, PII SECUNDI NEPOS, MDIII, SEPTEMBRIS XXI,\\n     APERTIS ELECTUS SUFFRAGIIS, OCTAVO OCTOBRIS CORONATUS EST.\\nWhen Pinturicchio was working with Pietro Perugino and painting at\\nRome in the time of Pope Sixtus, he had also been in the service of\\nDomenico della Rovere, Cardinal of San Clemente; wherefore the said\\nCardinal, having built a very beautiful palace in the Borgo Vecchio,\\ncharged Pinturicchio to paint the whole of it, and to make on the\\nfaçade the coat of arms of Pope Sixtus, with two little boys as\\nsupporters. The same master executed certain works for Sciarra Colonna\\nin the Palace of S. Apostolo; and no long time after--namely, in the\\nyear 1484--Innocent VIII, the Genoese, caused him to paint certain\\nhalls and loggie in the Palace of the Belvedere, where, among other\\nthings, by order of that Pope, he painted a loggia full of landscapes,\\ndepicting therein Rome, Milan, Genoa, Florence, Venice, and Naples,\\nafter the manner of the Flemings; and this, being a thing not\\ncustomary at that time, gave no little satisfaction. In the same\\nplace, over the principal door of entrance, he painted a Madonna in\\nfresco. In S. Pietro, in the chapel that contains the Lance which\\npierced the side of Christ, he painted a panel in distemper, with the\\nMadonna larger than life, for the said Innocent VIII; and he painted\\ntwo chapels in the Church of S. Maria del Popolo, one for the\\naforesaid Domenico della Rovere, Cardinal of San Clemente, who was\\nafterwards buried therein, and the other for Cardinal Innocenzio Cibo,\\nwherein he also was afterwards buried; and in each of these chapels he\\nportrayed the Cardinal who had caused him to paint it. In the Palace\\nof the Pope he painted certain rooms that look out upon the courtyard\\nof S. Pietro, the ceilings and paintings of which were renovated a few\\nyears ago by Pope Pius IV. In the same palace Alexander VI caused\\nPinturicchio to paint all the rooms that he occupied, together with\\nthe whole of the Borgia Tower, wherein he wrought stories of the\\nliberal arts in one room, besides decorating all the ceilings with\\nstucco and gold; but, since they did not then know the method of\\nstucco-work that is now in use, the aforesaid ornaments are for the\\nmost part ruined. Over the door of an apartment in the said palace he\\nportrayed the Signora Giulia Farnese in the countenance of a Madonna,\\nand, in the same picture, the head of Pope Alexander in a figure that\\nis adoring her.\\nBernardino was much given to making gilt ornaments in relief for his\\npictures, to satisfy people who had little understanding of his art\\nwith the more showy lustre that this gave them, which is a most\\nbarbarous thing in painting. Having then executed a story of S.\\nCatherine in the said apartments, he depicted the arches of Rome in\\nrelief and the figures in painting, insomuch that, the figures being\\nin the foreground and the buildings in the background, the things\\nthat should recede stand out more prominently than those that should\\nstrike the eye as the larger--a very grave heresy in our art.\\nIn the Castello di S. Angelo he painted a vast number of rooms with\\ngrotesques; and in the Great Tower, in the garden below, he painted\\nstories of Pope Alexander, with portraits of the Catholic Queen,\\nIsabella; Niccolò Orsino, Count of Pittigliano; Gianjacomo Trivulzi,\\nand many other relatives and friends of the said Pope, in particular\\nCæsar Borgia and his brother and sisters, with many talented men of\\nthose times. At Monte Oliveto in Naples, in the Chapel of Paolo\\nTolosa, there is a panel with an Assumption by the hand of\\nPinturicchio. This master made an infinite number of other works\\nthroughout all Italy, which, since they are of no great excellence,\\nand wrought in a superficial manner, I will pass over in silence.\\nPinturicchio used to say that a painter could only give the greatest\\nrelief to his figures when he had it in himself, without owing\\nanything to principles or to others. He also made works in Perugia,\\nbut these were few. In the Araceli he painted the Chapel of S.\\nBernardino; and in S. Maria del Popolo, where, as we have said, he\\npainted the two chapels, he made the four Doctors of the Church on\\nthe vaulting of the principal chapel.\\nAfterwards, having reached the age of fifty-nine, he was\\ncommissioned to paint the Nativity of Our Lady on a panel in S.\\nFrancesco at Siena. To this he set his hand, and the friars assigned\\nto him a room to live in, which they gave to him, as he wished,\\nempty and stripped of everything, save only a huge old chest, which\\nappeared to them too awkward to remove. But Pinturicchio, like the\\nstrange and whimsical man that he was, made such an outcry at this,\\nand repeated it so often, that finally in despair the friars set\\nthemselves to carry it away. Now their good fortune was such, that\\nin removing it there was broken a plank which contained 500 Roman\\nducats of gold; at which Pinturicchio was so displeased, and felt so\\naggrieved at the good luck of those poor friars, that it can hardly\\nbe imagined--nay, he took it so much to heart, being unable to get\\nit out of his thoughts, that it was the death of him. His pictures\\ndate about the year 1513.\\nA companion and friend of Pinturicchio, although he was a much older\\nman, was Benedetto Buonfiglio, a painter of Perugia, who executed\\nmany works in company with other masters in the Papal Palace at\\nRome. In the Chapel of the Signoria in Perugia, his native city, he\\npainted scenes from the life of S. Ercolano, Bishop and Protector of\\nthat city, and in the same place certain miracles wrought by S.\\nLouis. In S. Domenico he painted the story of the Magi on a panel in\\ndistemper, and many saints on another. In the Church of S.\\nBernardino he painted a Christ in the sky, with S. Bernardino\\nhimself, and a multitude below. In short, this master was in no\\nlittle repute in his native city before Pietro Perugino had come to\\nbe known.\\nAnother friend of Pinturicchio, associated with him in not a few of\\nhis works, was Gerino Pistoiese, who was held to be a diligent\\ncolourist and a faithful imitator of the manner of Pietro Perugino,\\nwith whom he worked nearly up to his death. He did little work in\\nhis native city of Pistoia; but for the Company of the Buon Gesù in\\nBorgo San Sepolcro he painted a Circumcision in oil on a panel,\\nwhich is passing good. In the Pieve of the same place he painted a\\nchapel in fresco; and on the bank of the Tiber, on the road that\\nleads to Anghiari, he painted another chapel, also in fresco, for\\nthe Commune. And he painted still another chapel in the same place,\\nin S. Lorenzo, an abbey of the Monks of Camaldoli. By reason of all\\nthese works he made so long a stay in the Borgo that he almost\\nadopted it as his home. He was a sorry fellow in matters of art,\\nlabouring with the greatest difficulty, and toiling with such pains\\nat the execution of a work, that it was a torture to him.\\nAt this same time there was a painter in the city of Foligno,\\nNiccolò Alunno, who was held to be excellent, for it was little the\\ncustom before Pietro Perugino's day to paint in oil, and many were\\nheld to be able men who did not afterwards justify this opinion.\\nNiccolò therefore gave no little satisfaction with his works, since,\\nalthough he only painted in distemper, he portrayed the heads of his\\nfigures from life, so that they appeared alive, and his manner won\\nconsiderable praise. In S. Agostino at Foligno there is a panel by\\nhis hand with a Nativity of Christ, and a predella with little\\nfigures. At Assisi he painted a banner that is borne in processions,\\nbesides the panel of the high-altar in the Duomo, and another panel\\nin S. Francesco. But the best painting that Niccolò ever did was in\\na chapel in the Duomo, where, among other things, there is a\\nPietà, with two angels who are holding two torches and weeping so\\nnaturally, that I do not believe that any other painter, however\\nexcellent, would have been able to do much better. In the same place\\nhe also painted the façade of S. Maria degli Angeli, besides many\\nother works of which there is no need to make mention, it being\\nenough to have touched on the best. And let this be the end of the\\nLife of Pinturicchio, who, besides his other qualities, gave no\\nlittle satisfaction to many princes and lords because he finished\\nand delivered his works quickly, which is their pleasure, although\\nsuch works are perchance less excellent than those that are made\\nslowly and deliberately.\", \"FRANCESCO FRANCIA\\nGOLDSMITH AND PAINTER OF BOLOGNA\\nFrancesco Francia, who was born in Bologna in the year 1450, of\\nparents who were artisans, but honest and worthy enough, was\\napprenticed in his earliest boyhood to the goldsmith's art, in which\\ncalling he worked with intelligence and spirit; and as he grew up he\\nbecame so well proportioned in person and appearance, and so sweet and\\npleasant in manner and speech, that he was able to keep the most\\nmelancholy of men cheerful and free from care with his talk; for which\\nreason he was beloved not only by all those who knew him, but also by\\nmany Italian princes and other lords. While working as a goldsmith,\\nthen, he gave attention to design, in which he took so much pleasure,\\nthat his mind began to aspire to higher things, and he made very great\\nprogress therein, as may be seen from many works in silver that he\\nexecuted in his native city of Bologna, and particularly from certain\\nmost excellent works in niello. In this manner of work he often put\\ntwenty most beautiful and well-proportioned little figures within a\\nspace no higher than the breadth of two fingers and not much more in\\nlength. He also enamelled many works in silver, which were destroyed\\nat the time of the ruin and exile of the Bentivogli. In a word, he did\\neverything that can be done in that art better than any other man.\\nBut that in which he delighted above all, and in which he was truly\\nexcellent, was the making of dies for medals, wherein he was the\\nrarest master of his day, as may be seen in some that he made with a\\nmost lifelike head of Pope Julius II, which bear comparison with\\nthose of Caradosso; not to mention that he made medals of Signor\\nGiovanni Bentivogli, in which he appears alive, and of an infinite\\nnumber of princes, who would stop in Bologna on their way through\\nthe city, whereupon he would make their portraits in wax for medals,\\nand afterwards, having finished the matrices of the dies, he would\\nsend them; for which, besides immortal fame, he also received very\\nrich presents. As long as he lived he was ever Master of the Mint in\\nBologna, for which he made the stamps of all the dies, both under\\nthe rule of the Bentivogli and also during the lifetime of Pope\\nJulius, after their departure, as is proved by the coins struck by\\nthat Pope on his entrance into the city, which had on one side his\\nhead portrayed from life, and on the other these words: BONONIA PER\\nJULIUM A TYRANNO LIBERATA. So excellent was he held in this\\nprofession, that he continued to make the dies for the coinage down\\nto the time of Pope Leo; and the impressions of his dies are so\\ngreatly prized, and those who have some hold them in such esteem,\\nthat money cannot buy them.\\nNow it came to pass that Francia, being desirous of greater glory,\\nand having known Andrea Mantegna and many other painters who had\\ngained wealth and honours by their art, determined to try whether he\\ncould succeed in that part of painting which had to do with colour;\\nhis drawing was already such that it could well bear comparison with\\ntheirs. Thereupon, having made arrangements to try his hand, he\\npainted certain portraits and some little things, keeping in his\\nhouse for many months men of that profession to teach him the means\\nand methods of colouring, insomuch that, having very good judgment,\\nhe soon acquired the needful practice. The first work that he made\\nwas a panel of no great size for Messer Bartolommeo Felicini, who\\nplaced it in the Misericordia, a church without Bologna; in which\\npanel there is a Madonna seated on a throne, with many other\\nfigures, and the said Messer Bartolommeo portrayed from life. This\\nwork, which was wrought in oil with the greatest diligence, was\\npainted by him in the year 1490; and it gave such satisfaction in\\nBologna, that Messer Giovanni Bentivogli, desiring to honour his own\\nchapel, which was in S. Jacopo in that city, with works by this new\\npainter, commissioned him to paint a panel with the Madonna in the\\nsky, two figures on either side of her, and two angels below\\nsounding instruments; which work was so well executed by Francia,\\nthat he won from Messer Giovanni, besides praise, a most honourable\\npresent. Wherefore Monsignore de' Bentivogli, impressed by this\\nwork, caused him to paint a panel containing the Nativity of Christ,\\nwhich was much extolled, for the high-altar of the Misericordia;\\nwherein, besides the design, which is not otherwise than beautiful,\\nthe invention and the colouring are worthy of nothing but praise. In\\nthis work he made a portrait of Monsignore de' Bentivogli from the\\nlife (a very good likeness, so it is said by those who knew him),\\nclothed in that very pilgrim's dress in which he returned from\\nJerusalem. He also painted a panel in the Church of the Nunziata,\\nwithout the Porta di S. Mammolo, representing the Madonna receiving\\nthe Annunciation from the Angel, with two figures on either side,\\nwhich is held to be a very well executed work.\\nNow that Francia's works had spread his fame abroad, even as his\\npainting in oil had brought him both profit and repute, so he\\ndetermined to try whether he would succeed as well at working in\\nfresco. Messer Giovanni Bentivogli had caused his palace to be\\npainted by diverse masters of Ferrara and Bologna, and by certain\\nothers from Modena; but, having seen Francia's experiments in\\nfresco, he determined that this master should paint a scene on one\\nwall of an apartment that he occupied for his own use. There Francia\\npainted the camp of Holofernes, guarded by various sentinels both on\\nfoot and on horseback, who were keeping watch over the pavilions;\\nand the while that they were intent on something else, the sleeping\\nHolofernes was seen surprised by a woman clothed in widow's\\ngarments, who, with her left hand, was holding his hair, which was\\nwet with the heat of wine and sleep, and with her right hand she was\\nstriking the blow to slay her enemy, the while that an old wrinkled\\nhandmaid, with the true air of a most faithful slave, and with her\\neyes fixed on those of her Judith in order to encourage her, was\\nbending down and holding a basket near the ground, to receive\\ntherein the head of the slumbering lover. This scene was one of the\\nmost beautiful and most masterly that Francia ever painted, but it\\nwas thrown to the ground in the destruction of that edifice at the\\ntime of the expulsion of the Bentivogli, together with another scene\\nover that same apartment, coloured to look like bronze, and\\nrepresenting a disputation of philosophers, which was excellently\\nwrought, with his conception very well expressed. These works\\nbrought it about that he was loved and honoured by Messer Giovanni\\nand all the members of his house, and, after them, by all the city.\\nIn the Chapel of S. Cecilia, which is attached to the Church of S.\\nJacopo, he painted two scenes wrought in fresco, in one of which he\\nmade the Marriage of Our Lady with Joseph, and in the other the\\nDeath of S. Cecilia--a work held in great esteem by the people of\\nBologna. And, indeed, Francia gained such mastery and such\\nconfidence from seeing his works advancing towards the perfection\\nthat he desired, that he executed many pictures, of which I will\\nmake no mention, it being enough for me to point out, to all who may\\nwish to see his works, only the best and most notable. Nor did his\\npainting hinder him from carrying on both the Mint and his other\\nwork of making medals, as he had done from the beginning. Francia,\\nso it is said, felt the greatest sorrow at the departure of Messer\\nGiovanni Bentivogli, for he had received such great benefits from\\nMesser Giovanni, that it caused him infinite grief; however, like\\nthe prudent and orderly man that he was, he kept at his work. After\\nhis parting from his patron, he painted three panels that went to\\nModena, in one of which there was the Baptism of Christ by S. John;\\nin the second, a very beautiful Annunciation; and in the last, which\\nwas placed in the Church of the Frati dell' Osservanza, a Madonna in\\nthe sky with many figures.\\nThe fame of so excellent a master being spread abroad by means of so\\nmany works, the cities contended with one another to obtain his\\npictures. Whereupon he painted a panel for the Black Friars of S.\\nGiovanni in Parma, containing a Dead Christ in the lap of Our Lady,\\nsurrounded by many figures; which panel was universally held to be a\\nmost beautiful work; and the same friars, therefore, thinking that\\nthey had been well served, induced him to make another for a house\\nof theirs at Reggio in Lombardy, wherein he painted a Madonna with\\nmany figures. At Cesena, likewise for the church of these friars, he\\nexecuted another panel, painting therein the Circumcision of Christ,\\nwith lovely colouring. Nor would the people of Ferrara consent to\\nbe left behind by their neighbours; nay, having determined to adorn\\ntheir Duomo with works by Francia, they commissioned him to paint a\\npanel, on which he made a great number of figures; and they named it\\nthe panel of Ognissanti. He painted one in S. Lorenzo at Bologna,\\nwith a Madonna, a figure on either side, and two children below,\\nwhich was much extolled; and scarcely had he finished this when he\\nhad to make another in S. Giobbe, representing a Crucifixion, with\\nthat Saint kneeling at the foot of the Cross, and two figures at the\\nsides.\\nSo widely had the fame and the works of this craftsman spread\\nthroughout Lombardy, that even from Tuscany men sent for something\\nby his hand, as they did from Lucca, whither there went a panel\\ncontaining a S. Anne and a Madonna, with many other figures, and a\\nDead Christ above in the lap of His Mother; which work is set up in\\nthe Church of S. Fridiano, and is held in great price by the people\\nof Lucca. For the Church of the Nunziata in Bologna he painted two\\nother panels, which were wrought with much diligence; and in the\\nMisericordia, likewise, without the Porta a Strà Castione, at the\\nrequest of a lady of the Manzuoli family, he painted another,\\nwherein he depicted the Madonna with the Child in her arms, S.\\nGeorge, S. John the Baptist, S. Stephen, and S. Augustine, with an\\nangel below, who has his hands clasped with such grace, that he\\nappears truly to belong to Paradise. He executed another for the\\nCompany of S. Francesco in the same city, and likewise one for the\\nCompany of S. Gieronimo. He lived in close intimacy with Messer Polo\\nZambeccaro, who, being much his friend, and wishing to have some\\nmemorial of him, caused him to paint a rather large picture of the\\nNativity of Christ, which is one of the most celebrated works that\\nhe ever made; and for this reason Messer Polo commissioned him to\\npaint at his villa two figures in fresco, which are very beautiful.\\nHe also executed a most charming scene in fresco in the house of\\nMesser Gieronimo Bolognino, with many varied and very beautiful\\nfigures.\\nAll these works together had won him such veneration in that city,\\nthat he was held in the light of a god; and what made this\\ninfinitely greater was that the Duke of Urbino caused him to paint a\\nset of horse's caparisons, in which he made a vast forest of trees\\nthat had caught fire, from which there were issuing great numbers of\\nall sorts of animals, both of the air and of the earth, and certain\\nfigures--a terrible, awful, and truly beautiful thing, which was\\nheld in no little esteem by reason of the time spent in painting the\\nplumage of the birds, and the various sorts of terrestrial animals,\\nto say nothing of the diversity of foliage and the variety of\\nbranches that were seen in the different trees. For this work\\nFrancia was rewarded with gifts of great value as a recompense for\\nhis labours, not to mention that the Duke ever held himself indebted\\nto him for the praises that he received for it. Duke Guido Baldo,\\nalso, has in his guardaroba a picture of the Roman Lucretia, which\\nhe esteems very highly, by the same man's hand, together with many\\nother pictures, of which mention will be made when the time comes.\\nAfter these things he painted a panel for the altar of the Madonna\\nin SS. Vitale e Agricola; in which panel are two very beautiful\\nangels, who are playing on the lute. I will not enumerate the\\npictures that are scattered throughout Bologna in the houses of\\ngentlemen of that city, and still less the infinite number of\\nportraits that he made from life, for it would be too wearisome. Let\\nit be enough to say that while he was living in such glory and\\nenjoying the fruits of his labours in peace, Raffaello da Urbino was\\nin Rome, and all day long there flocked round him many strangers,\\namong them many gentlemen of Bologna, eager to see his works. And\\nsince it generally comes to pass that every man extols most\\nwillingly the intellects of his native place, these Bolognese began\\nto praise the works, the life, and the talents of Francia in the\\npresence of Raffaello, and they established such a friendship\\nbetween them with these words, that Francia and Raffaello sent\\nletters of greeting to each other. And Francia, hearing such great\\npraise spoken of the divine pictures of Raffaello, desired to see\\nhis works; but he was now old, and too fond of his comfortable life\\nin Bologna. Now after this it came about that Raffaello painted in\\nRome for Cardinal Santi Quattro, of the Pucci family, a\\npanel-picture of S. Cecilia, which had to be sent to Bologna to be\\nplaced in a chapel of S. Giovanni in Monte, where there is the tomb\\nof the Blessed Elena dall' Olio. This he packed up and addressed to\\nFrancia, who, as his friend, was to have it placed on the altar of\\nthat chapel, with the ornament, just as he had prepared it himself.\\nRight readily did Francia accept this charge, which gave him a\\nchance of seeing a work by Raffaello, as he had so much desired. And\\nhaving opened the letter that Raffaello had written to him, in which\\nhe besought Francia, if there were any scratch in the work, to put\\nit right, and likewise, as a friend, to correct any error that he\\nmight notice, with the greatest joy he had the said panel taken from\\nits case into a good light. But such was the amazement that it\\ncaused him, and so great his marvel, that, recognizing his own error\\nand the foolish presumption of his own rash confidence, he took it\\ngreatly to heart, and in a very short time died of grief.\\nRaffaello's panel was divine, not so much painted as alive, and so\\nwell wrought and coloured by him, that among all the beautiful\\npictures that he painted while he lived, although they are all\\nmiraculous, it could well be called most rare. Wherefore Francia,\\nhalf dead with terror at the beauty of the picture, which lay before\\nhis eyes challenging comparison with those by his own hand that he\\nsaw around him, felt all confounded, and had it placed with great\\ndiligence in that chapel of S. Giovanni in Monte for which it was\\ndestined; and taking to his bed in a few days almost beside himself,\\nthinking that he was now almost of no account in his art in\\ncomparison with the opinion held both by himself and by others, he\\ndied of grief and melancholy, so some believe, overtaken by the same\\nfate, through contemplating too attentively that most lifelike\\npicture of Raffaello's, as befell Fivizzano from feasting his eyes\\nwith his own beautiful Death, about which the following epigram was\\nwritten:\\n  Me veram pictor divinus mente recepit;\\n    Admota est operi deinde perita manus.\\n  Dumque opere in facto defigit lumina pictor,\\n    Intentus nimium, palluit et moritur.\\n  Viva igitur sum mors, non mortua mortis imago,\\n    Si fungor quo mors fungitur officio.\\nHowever, certain others say that his death was so sudden, that from\\nmany symptoms it appeared to be due rather to poison or apoplexy\\nthan to anything else. Francia was a prudent man, most regular in\\nhis way of life, and very robust. After his death, in the year 1518,\\nhe was honourably buried by his sons in Bologna.\", 'PIETRO PERUGINO\\n[_PIETRO VANNUCCI, OR PIETRO DA CASTEL DELLA PIEVE_]\\nPAINTER\\nHow great a benefit poverty may be to men of genius, and how potent\\na force it may be to make them become excellent--nay, perfect--in\\nthe exercise of any faculty whatsoever, can be seen clearly enough\\nin the actions of Pietro Perugino, who, flying from the extremity of\\ndistress at Perugia, and betaking himself to Florence in the desire\\nto attain to some distinction by means of his talent, remained for\\nmany months without any other bed than a miserable chest to sleep\\nin, turning night into day, and devoting himself with the greatest\\nardour to the unceasing study of his profession. And, having made a\\nhabit of this, he knew no other pleasure than to labour continually\\nat his art, and to be for ever painting; for with the fear of\\npoverty constantly before his eyes, he would do for gain such work\\nas he would probably not have looked at if he had possessed the\\nwherewithal to live. Riches, indeed, might perchance have closed the\\npath on which his talent should advance towards excellence, no less\\neffectually than poverty opened it to him, while necessity spurred\\nhim on in his desire to rise from so low and miserable a condition,\\nif not to supreme eminence, at least to a rank in which he might\\nhave the means of life. For this reason he never took heed of cold,\\nof hunger, of hardship, of discomfort, of fatigue, or of ridicule,\\nif only he might one day live in ease and repose; ever saying, as it\\nwere by way of proverb, that after bad weather there must come the\\ngood, and that during the good men build the houses that are to\\nshelter them when there is need.\\nBut in order that the rise of this craftsman may be better known, let\\nme begin with his origin, and relate that, according to common report,\\nthere was born in the city of Perugia, to a poor man of Castello\\ndella Pieve, named Cristofano, a son who was baptized with the name of\\nPietro. This son, brought up amid misery and distress, was given by\\nhis father as a shop-boy to a painter of Perugia, who was no great\\nmaster of his profession, but held in great veneration both the art\\nand the men who were excellent therein; nor did he ever cease to tell\\nPietro how much gain and honour painting brought to those who\\npractised it well, and he would urge the boy to the study of that art\\nby recounting to him the rewards won by ancient and modern masters;\\nwherefore he fired his mind in such a manner, that Pietro took it into\\nhis head to try, if only fortune would assist him, to become one of\\nthese. For this reason he was often wont to ask any man whom he knew\\nto have seen the world, in what part the best craftsmen in that\\ncalling were formed; particularly his master, who always gave him one\\nand the same answer--namely, that it was in Florence more than in any\\nother place that men became perfect in all the arts, especially in\\npainting, since in that city men are spurred by three things. The\\nfirst is censure, which is uttered freely and by many, seeing that the\\nair of that city makes men\\'s intellects so free by nature, that they\\ndo not content themselves, like a flock of sheep, with mediocre works,\\nbut ever consider them with regard to the honour of the good and the\\nbeautiful rather than out of respect for the craftsman. The second is\\nthat, if a man wishes to live there, he must be industrious, which is\\nnaught else than to say that he must continually exercise his\\nintelligence and his judgment, must be ready and adroit in his\\naffairs, and, finally, must know how to make money, seeing that the\\nterritory of Florence is not so wide or abundant as to enable her to\\nsupport at little cost all who live there, as can be done in countries\\nthat are rich enough. The third, which is perchance no less potent\\nthan the others, is an eager desire for glory and honour, which is\\ngenerated mightily by that air in the men of all professions; and this\\ndesire, in all persons of spirit, will not let them stay content with\\nbeing equal, much less inferior, to those whom they see to be men like\\nthemselves, although they may recognize them as masters--nay, it\\nforces them very often to desire their own advancement so eagerly,\\nthat, if they are not kindly or wise by nature, they turn out\\nevil-speakers, ungrateful, and unthankful for benefits. It is true,\\nindeed, that when a man has learnt there as much as suffices him, he\\nmust, if he wishes to do more than live from day to day like an\\nanimal, and desires to become rich, take his departure from that place\\nand find a sale abroad for the excellence of his works and for the\\nrepute conferred on him by that city, as the doctors do with the fame\\nderived from their studies. For Florence treats her craftsmen as time\\ntreats its own works, which when perfected, it destroys and consumes\\nlittle by little.\\nMoved by these counsels, therefore, and by the persuasions of many\\nothers, Pietro came to Florence, minded to become excellent; and\\nwell did he succeed, for the reason that in those times works in his\\nmanner were held in very great price. He studied under the\\ndiscipline of Andrea Verrocchio, and his first figures were painted\\nwithout the Porta a Prato, in the Nunnery of S. Martino, now in\\nruins by reason of the wars. In Camaldoli he made a S. Jerome on a\\nwall, which was then much esteemed by the Florentines and celebrated\\nwith great praise, for the reason that he made that Saint old, lean,\\nand emaciated, with his eyes fixed on the Crucifix, and so wasted\\naway, that he seems like an anatomical model, as may be seen from a\\ncopy of that picture which is in the hands of the aforesaid\\nBartolommeo Gondi. In a few years, then, he came into such credit,\\nthat his works filled not only Florence and all Italy, but also\\nFrance, Spain, and many other countries to which they were sent.\\nWherefore, his paintings being held in very great price and repute,\\nmerchants began to buy them up wholesale and to send them abroad to\\nvarious countries, to their own great gain and profit.\\nFor the Nuns of S. Chiara he painted a Dead Christ on a panel, with\\nsuch lovely and novel colouring, that he made the craftsmen believe\\nthat he would become excellent and marvellous. In this work there\\nare seen some most beautiful heads of old men, and likewise certain\\nfigures of the Maries, who, having ceased to weep, are contemplating\\nthe Dead Jesus with extraordinary awe and love; not to mention that\\nhe made therein a landscape that was then held most beautiful,\\nbecause the true method of making them, such as it appeared later,\\nhad not yet been seen. It is said that Francesco del Pugliese\\noffered to give to the aforesaid nuns three times as much money as\\nthey had paid to Pietro, and to have a similar one made for them by\\nthe same man\\'s hand, but that they would not consent, because Pietro\\nsaid that he did not believe he could equal it.\\nThere were also many things by the hand of Pietro in the Convent of\\nthe Frati Gesuati, without the Porta a Pinti; and since the said\\nchurch and convent are now in ruins, I do not wish, with this\\noccasion, and before I proceed further with this Life, to grudge the\\nlabour of giving some little account of them. This church, then, the\\narchitect of which was Antonio di Giorgio of Settignano, was forty\\nbraccia long and twenty wide. At the upper end one ascended by four\\ntreads, or rather steps, to a platform six braccia in extent, on\\nwhich stood the high-altar, with many ornaments carved in stone; and\\non the said altar was a panel with a rich ornament, by the hand, as\\nhas been related, of Domenico Ghirlandajo. In the centre of the\\nchurch was a partition-wall, with a door wrought in open-work from\\nthe middle upwards, on either side of which was an altar, while over\\neither altar, as will be told, there stood a panel by the hand of\\nPietro Perugino. Over the said door was a most beautiful Crucifix by\\nthe hand of Benedetto da Maiano, with a Madonna on one side and a S.\\nJohn on the other, both in relief. Before the said platform of the\\nhigh-altar, and against the said partition-wall, was a choir of the\\nDoric Order, very well wrought in walnut-wood; and over the\\nprincipal door of the church there was another choir, which rested\\non well-strengthened woodwork, with the under part forming a\\nceiling, or rather soffit, beautifully partitioned, and with a row\\nof balusters acting as parapet to the front of the choir, which\\nfaced towards the high-altar. This choir was very convenient to the\\nfriars of that convent for holding their night services, for saying\\ntheir individual prayers, and likewise for week-days. Over the\\nprincipal door of the church--which was made with most beautiful\\nornaments of stone, and had a portico in front raised on columns,\\nwhich made a covered way as far as the door of the convent--was a\\nlunette with a very beautiful figure of S. Giusto, the Bishop, and\\nan angel on either side, by the hand of the illuminator Gherardo;\\nand this because that church was dedicated to the said S. Giusto,\\nand within it those friars preserved a relic of that Saint--that is,\\nan arm. At the entrance of the convent was a little cloister of\\nexactly the same size as the church--namely, forty braccia long and\\ntwenty wide--with arches and vaulting going right round and\\nsupported by columns of stone, thus making a spacious and most\\ncommodious loggia on every side. In the centre of the court of this\\ncloister, which was all neatly paved with squared stone, was a very\\nbeautiful well, with a loggia above, which likewise rested on\\ncolumns of stone, and made a rich and beautiful ornament. In this\\ncloister were the chapter-house of the friars, the side-door of\\nentrance into the church, and the stairs that ascended to the\\ndormitory and other rooms for the use of the friars. On the farther\\nside of this cloister, in a straight line with the principal door of\\nthe convent, was a passage as long as the chapter-house and the\\nsteward\\'s room put together, leading into another cloister larger\\nand more beautiful than the first; and the whole of this straight\\nline--that is, the forty braccia of the loggia of the first\\ncloister, the passage, and the line of the second cloister--made a\\nvery long enfilade, more beautiful than words can tell, and the\\nrather as from that farther cloister, in the same straight line,\\nthere issued a garden-walk two hundred braccia in length; and all\\nthis, as one came from the principal door of the convent, made a\\nmarvellous view. In the said second cloister was a refectory, sixty\\nbraccia long and eighteen wide, with all those well-appointed rooms,\\nand, as the friars call them, offices, which were required in such a\\nconvent. Over this was a dormitory in the shape of a =T=, one part\\nof which--namely, the principal part in the direct line, which was\\nsixty braccia long--was double--that is to say, it had cells on\\neither side, and at the upper end, in a space of fifteen braccia,\\nwas an oratory, over the altar of which there was a panel by the\\nhand of Pietro Perugino; and over the door of this oratory was\\nanother work by the same man\\'s hand, in fresco, as will be told. And\\non the same floor, above the chapter-house, was a large room where\\nthose fathers worked at making glass windows, with the little\\nfurnaces and other conveniences that were necessary for such an\\nindustry; and since while Pietro lived he made the cartoons for many\\nof their works, those that they executed in his time were all\\nexcellent. Then the garden of this convent was so beautiful and so\\nwell kept, and the vines were trained round the cloister and in\\nevery place with such good order, that nothing better could be seen\\nin the neighbourhood of Florence. In like manner the room wherein\\nthey distilled scented waters and medicines, as was their custom,\\nhad all the best conveniences that could possibly be imagined. In\\nshort, that convent was one of the most beautiful and best appointed\\nthat there were in the State of Florence; and it is for this reason\\nthat I have wished to make this record of it, and the rather as the\\ngreater part of the pictures that were therein were by the hand of\\nour Pietro Perugino.\\nReturning at length to this Pietro, I have to say that of the works\\nthat he made in the said convent none have been preserved save the\\npanels, since those executed in fresco were thrown to the ground,\\ntogether with the whole of that building, by reason of the siege of\\nFlorence, when the panels were carried to the Porta a S. Pier\\nGattolini, where a home was given to those friars in the Church and\\nConvent of S. Giovannino. Now the two panels on the aforesaid\\npartition-wall were by the hand of Pietro; and in one was Christ in\\nthe Garden, with the Apostles sleeping, in whom Pietro showed how\\nwell sleep can prevail over pains and discomforts, having\\nrepresented them asleep in attitudes of perfect ease. In the other\\nhe made a Pietà--that is, Christ in the lap of Our Lady--surrounded\\nby four figures no less excellent than any others in his manner;\\nand, to mention only one thing, he made the Dead Christ all\\nstiffened, as if He had been so long on the Cross that the length of\\ntime and the cold had reduced Him to this; wherefore he painted Him\\nsupported by John and the Magdalene, all sorrowful and weeping. In\\nanother panel he painted the Crucifixion, with the Magdalene, and,\\nat the foot of the Cross, S. Jerome, S. John the Baptist, and the\\nBlessed Giovanni Colombini, founder of that Order; all with infinite\\ndiligence. These three panels have suffered considerably, and they\\nare all cracked in the dark parts and where there are shadows; and\\nthis comes to pass when the first coat of colour, which is laid on\\nthe ground (for three coats of colour are used, one over the other),\\nis worked on before it is thoroughly dry; wherefore afterwards, with\\ntime, in the drying, they draw through their thickness and come to\\nhave the strength to make those cracks; which Pietro could not\\nknow, seeing that in his time they were only just beginning to paint\\nwell in oil.\\nNow, the works of Pietro being much commended by the Florentines, a\\nPrior of the same Convent of the Ingesuati, who took delight in art,\\ncaused him to make a Nativity, with the Magi, on a wall in the first\\ncloister, after the manner of a miniature. This he brought to\\nperfect completion with great loveliness and a high finish, and it\\ncontained an infinite number of different heads, many of them\\nportrayed from life, among which was the head of Andrea del\\nVerrocchio, his master. In the same court, over the arches of the\\ncolumns, he made a frieze with heads of the size of life, very well\\nexecuted, among which was one of the said Prior, so lifelike and\\nwrought in so good a manner, that it was judged by the most\\nexperienced craftsmen to be the best thing that Pietro ever made. In\\nthe other cloister, over the door that led into the refectory, he\\nwas commissioned to paint a scene of Pope Boniface confirming the\\nhabit of his Order to the Blessed Giovanni Colombino, wherein he\\nportrayed eight of the aforesaid friars, and made a most beautiful\\nview receding in perspective, which was much extolled, and rightly,\\nsince Pietro made a particular profession of this. In another scene\\nbelow the first he began a Nativity of Christ, with certain angels\\nand shepherds, wrought with the freshest colouring. And in an arch\\nover the door of the aforesaid oratory he made three half-length\\nfigures--Our Lady, S. Jerome, and the Blessed Giovanni--with so\\nbeautiful a manner, that this was held to be one of the best mural\\npaintings that Pietro ever wrought.\\nThe said Prior, so I once heard tell, was very excellent at making\\nultramarine blues, and, therefore, having an abundance of them, he\\ndesired that Pietro should use them freely in all the above-mentioned\\nworks; but he was nevertheless so mean and suspicious that he would\\nnever trust Pietro, and always insisted on being present when he was\\nusing blue in the work. Wherefore Pietro, who had an honest and\\nupright nature, and had no desire for another man\\'s goods save in\\nreturn for his own labour, took the Prior\\'s distrust very ill, and\\nresolved to put him to shame; and so, having taken a basin of water,\\nand having laid on the ground for draperies or for anything else that\\nhe wished to paint in blue and white, from time to time he caused the\\nPrior, who turned grudgingly to his little bag, to put some\\nultramarine into the little vase that contained the tempera-water, and\\nthen, setting to work, at every second stroke of the brush Pietro\\nwould dip his brush in the basin, so that there remained more in the\\nwater than he had used on the picture. The Prior, who saw his little\\nbag becoming empty without much to show for it in the work, kept\\nsaying time after time: \"Oh, what a quantity of ultramarine this\\nplaster consumes!\" \"Does it not?\" Pietro would answer. After the\\ndeparture of the Prior, Pietro took the ultramarine from the bottom of\\nthe basin, and gave it back to him when he thought the time had come,\\nsaying: \"Father, this is yours; learn to trust honest men, who never\\ncheat those who trust them, although, if they wished, they could cheat\\nsuch distrustful persons as yourself.\"\\nBy reason of these works, then, and many others, Pietro came into\\nsuch repute that he was almost forced to go to Siena, where he\\npainted a large panel, which was held very beautiful, in S.\\nFrancesco; and he painted another in S. Agostino, containing a\\nCrucifix with some saints. A little time after this, for the Church\\nof S. Gallo in Florence, he painted a panel-picture of S. Jerome in\\nPenitence, which is now in S. Jacopo tra Fossi, where the aforesaid\\nfriars live, near the Canto degli Alberti. He was commissioned to\\npaint a Dead Christ, with the Madonna and S. John, above the steps\\nof the side-door of S. Pietro Maggiore; and this he wrought in such\\na manner, that it has been preserved, although exposed to rain and\\nwind, as fresh as if it had only just been finished by Pietro\\'s\\nhand. Truly intelligent was Pietro\\'s understanding of colour, both\\nin fresco and in oil; wherefore all experienced craftsmen are\\nindebted to him, for it is through him that they have knowledge of\\nthe lights that are seen throughout his works.\\nIn S. Croce, in the same city, he made a Pietà--that is, Our Lady\\nwith the Dead Christ in her arms--and two figures, which are\\nmarvellous to behold, not so much for their excellence, as for the\\nfact that they have remained so fresh and vivid in colouring,\\npainted as they are in fresco. He was commissioned by Bernardino de\\'\\nRossi, a citizen of Florence, to paint a S. Sebastian to be\\nsent into France, the price agreed on being one hundred gold crowns;\\nbut this work was sold by Bernardino to the King of France for four\\nhundred gold ducats. At Vallombrosa he painted a panel for the\\nhigh-altar; and in the Certosa of Pavia, likewise, he executed a\\npanel for the friars of that place. At the command of Cardinal\\nCaraffa of Naples he painted an Assumption of Our Lady, with the\\nApostles marvelling round the tomb, for the high-altar of the\\nPiscopio; and for Abbot Simone de\\' Graziani of Borgo a San Sepolcro\\nhe executed a large panel, which was painted in Florence, and then\\nborne to S. Gilio in the Borgo on the shoulders of porters, at very\\ngreat expense. To S. Giovanni in Monte at Bologna he sent a panel\\nwith certain figures standing upright, and a Madonna in the sky.\\nThereupon the fame of Pietro spread so widely throughout Italy and\\nabroad, that to his great glory he was summoned to Rome by Pope\\nSixtus IV to work in his chapel in company with the other excellent\\ncraftsmen. There, in company with Don Bartolommeo della Gatta, Abbot\\nof S. Clemente at Arezzo, he painted the scene of Christ giving the\\nkeys to S. Peter; and likewise the Nativity and Baptism of Christ,\\nand the Birth of Moses, with the daughter of Pharaoh finding him in\\nthe little ark. And on the same wall where the altar is he painted a\\nmural picture of the Assumption of Our Lady, with a portrait of Pope\\nSixtus on his knees. But these works were thrown to the ground in\\npreparing the wall for the Judgment of the divine Michelagnolo, in\\nthe time of Pope Paul III. On a vault of the Borgia Tower in the\\nPapal Palace he painted certain stories of Christ, with some foliage\\nin chiaroscuro, which had an extraordinary name for excellence in\\nhis time. In S. Marco, likewise in Rome, he painted a story of two\\nmartyrs beside the Sacrament--one of the best works that he made in\\nRome. For Sciarra Colonna, also, in the Palace of S. Apostolo, he\\npainted a loggia and certain rooms.\\nThese works brought him a very great sum of money; wherefore, having\\nresolved to remain no longer in Rome, and having departed in good\\nfavour with the whole Court, he returned to his native city of\\nPerugia, in many parts of which he executed panels and works in\\nfresco; and, in particular, a panel-picture painted in oils for the\\nChapel of the Palace of the Signori, containing Our Lady and other\\nsaints. In S. Francesco del Monte he painted two chapels in fresco,\\none with the story of the Magi going to make offering to Christ, and\\nthe other with the martyrdom of certain friars of S. Francis, who,\\ngoing to the Soldan of Babylon, were put to death. In S. Francesco\\ndel Convento, likewise, he painted two panels in oil, one with the\\nResurrection of Christ, and the other with S. John the Baptist and\\nother saints. For the Church of the Servi he also painted two\\npanels, one of the Transfiguration of Our Lord, and in the other,\\nwhich is beside the sacristy, the Story of the Magi; but, since\\nthese are not of the same excellence as the other works of Pietro,\\nit is held to be certain that they are among the first that he made.\\nIn the Chapel of the Crocifisso in S. Lorenzo, the Duomo of the same\\ncity, there are by the hand of Pietro the Madonna, the other Maries,\\nS. John, S. Laurence, S. James, and other saints. And for the Altar\\nof the Sacrament, where there is preserved the ring with which the\\nVirgin Mary was married, he painted the Marriage of the Virgin.\\nAfterwards he painted in fresco the whole of the Audience Chamber of\\nthe Cambio, adorning the compartments of the vaulting with the\\nseven planets, drawn in certain cars by diverse animals, according\\nto the old usage; on the wall opposite to the door of entrance he\\npainted the Nativity and Resurrection of Christ, with a panel\\ncontaining S. John the Baptist in the midst of certain other saints.\\nThe side-walls he painted in his own manner; one with figures of\\nFabius Maximus, Socrates, Numa Pompilius, F. Camillus, Pythagoras,\\nTrajan, L. Sicinius, the Spartan Leonidas, Horatius Cocles, Fabius,\\nSempronius, the Athenian Pericles, and Cincinnatus. On the other\\nwall he made the Prophets, Isaiah, Moses, Daniel, David, Jeremiah,\\nand Solomon; and the Sibyls, the Erythræan, the Libyan, the\\nTiburtine, the Delphic, and the others. Below each of the said\\nfigures he placed, in the form of a written motto, something said by\\nthem, and appropriate to that place. And in one of the ornaments he\\nmade his own portrait, which appears absolutely alive, and he wrote\\nhis own name below it in the following manner:\\n  PETRUS PERUSINUS EGREGIUS PICTOR.\\n  PERDITA SI FUERAT, PINGENDO HIC RETULIT ARTEM;\\n  SI NUNQUAM INVENTA ESSET HACTENUS, IPSE DEDIT.\\n  ANNO D. 1500.\\nThis work, which was very beautiful and more highly extolled than\\nany other that was executed by Pietro in Perugia, is now held in\\ngreat price by the men of that city in memory of so famous a\\ncraftsman of their own country. Afterwards, in the principal chapel\\nof the Church of S. Agostino, the same man executed a large panel\\nstanding by itself and surrounded by a rich ornament, with S. John\\nbaptizing Christ on the front part, and on the back--that is, on the\\nside that faces the choir--the Nativity of Christ, with certain\\nsaints in the upper parts, and in the predella many scenes wrought\\nvery diligently with little figures. And in the Chapel of S.\\nNiccolò, in the said church, he painted a panel for Messer Benedetto\\nCalera.\\nAfter this, returning to Florence, he painted a S. Bernard on a\\npanel for the Monks of Cestello, and in the chapter-house a\\nCrucifix, the Madonna, S. Benedict, S. Bernard, and S. John. And in\\nS. Domenico da Fiesole, in the second chapel on the right hand, he\\npainted a panel containing Our Lady and three figures, among which\\nis a S. Sebastian worthy of the highest praise. Now Pietro had done\\nso much work, and he always had so many works in hand, that he would\\nvery often use the same subjects; and he had reduced the theory of\\nhis art to a manner so fixed, that he made all his figures with the\\nsame expression. By that time Michelagnolo Buonarroti had already\\ncome to the front, and Pietro greatly desired to see his figures, by\\nreason of the praise bestowed on him by craftsmen; and seeing the\\ngreatness of his own name, which he had acquired in every place\\nthrough so grand a beginning, being obscured, he was ever seeking to\\nwound his fellow-workers with biting words. For this reason, besides\\ncertain insults aimed at him by the craftsmen, he had only himself\\nto blame when Michelagnolo told him in public that he was a clumsy\\nfool at his art. But Pietro being unable to swallow such an affront,\\nthey both appeared before the Tribunal of Eight, where Pietro came\\noff with little honour. Meanwhile the Servite Friars of Florence,\\nwishing to have the altar-piece of their high-altar painted by some\\nfamous master, had handed it over, by reason of the departure of\\nLeonardo da Vinci, who had gone off to France, to Filippino; but he,\\nwhen he had finished half of one of two panels that were to adorn\\nthe altar, passed from this life to the next; wherefore the friars,\\nby reason of the faith that they had in Pietro, entrusted him with\\nthe whole work. In that panel, wherein he was painting the\\nDeposition of Christ from the Cross, Filippino had finished the\\nfigures of Nicodemus that are taking Him down; and Pietro continued\\nthe lower part with the Swooning of the Madonna, and certain other\\nfigures. Now this work was to be composed of two panels, one facing\\ntowards the choir of the friars, and the other towards the body of\\nthe church, and the Deposition from the Cross was to be placed\\nbehind, facing the choir, with the Assumption of Our Lady in front;\\nbut Pietro made the latter so commonplace, that the Deposition of\\nChrist was placed in front, and the Assumption on the side of the\\nchoir. These panels have now been removed, both one and the other,\\nand replaced by the Tabernacle of the Sacrament; they have been set\\nup over certain other altars in that church, and out of the whole\\nwork there only remain six pictures, wherein are some saints painted\\nby Pietro in certain niches. It is said that when the work was\\nunveiled, it received no little censure from all the new craftsmen,\\nparticularly because Pietro had availed himself of those figures\\nthat he had been wont to use in other pictures; with which his\\nfriends twitted him, saying that he had taken no pains, and that he\\nhad abandoned the good method of working, either through avarice or\\nto save time. To this Pietro would answer: \"I have used the figures\\nthat you have at other times praised, and which have given you\\ninfinite pleasure; if now they do not please you, and you do not\\npraise them, what can I do?\" But they kept assailing him bitterly\\nwith sonnets and open insults; whereupon, although now old, he\\ndeparted from Florence and returned to Perugia.\\nThere he executed certain works in fresco in the Church of S.\\nSevero, a place belonging to the Monks of the Order of Camaldoli,\\nwherein Raffaello da Urbino, when quite young and still the disciple\\nof Pietro, had painted certain figures, as will be told in his Life.\\nPietro likewise worked at Montone, at La Fratta, and in many other\\nplaces in the district of Perugia; more particularly in S. Maria\\ndegli Angeli at Assisi, where he painted in fresco a Christ on the\\nCross, with many figures, on the wall at the back of the Chapel of\\nthe Madonna, which faces the choir of the monks. And for the\\nhigh-altar of the Church of S. Pietro, an abbey of Black Friars in\\nPerugia, he painted a large panel containing the Ascension, with the\\nApostles below gazing up to Heaven; in the predella of which panel\\nare three stories, wrought with much diligence--namely, that of the\\nMagi, the Baptism of Christ, and His Resurrection. The whole of this\\npicture is seen to be full of beautiful and careful work, insomuch\\nthat it is the best of those wrought in oil by the hand of Pietro\\nwhich are in Perugia. The same man began a work in fresco of no\\nsmall importance at Castello della Pieve, but did not finish it.\\nIt was ever Pietro\\'s custom on his going and coming between the said\\nCastello and Perugia, like a man who trusted nobody, to carry all\\nthe money that he possessed about his person. Wherefore certain men,\\nlying in wait for him at a pass, robbed him, but at his earnest\\nentreaty they spared his life for the love of God; and afterwards,\\nby means of the services of his friends, who were numerous enough,\\nhe also recovered a great part of the money that had been taken from\\nhim; but none the less he came near dying of vexation. Pietro was a\\nman of very little religion, and he could never be made to believe\\nin the immortality of the soul--nay, with words in keeping with his\\nhead of granite, he rejected most obstinately every good suggestion.\\nHe placed all his hopes in the goods of fortune, and he would have\\nsold his soul for money. He earned great riches; and he both bought\\nand built houses in Florence, and acquired much settled property\\nboth at Perugia and at Castello della Pieve. He took a most\\nbeautiful young woman to wife, and had children by her; and he\\ndelighted so greatly in seeing her wearing beautiful head-dresses,\\nboth abroad and at home, that it is said that he would often tire\\nher head with his own hand. Finally, having reached the age of\\nseventy-eight, Pietro finished the course of his life at Castello\\ndella Pieve, where he was honourably buried, in the year 1524.\\nPietro made many masters in his own manner, and one among them, who\\nwas truly most excellent, devoted himself heart and soul to the\\nhonourable studies of painting, and surpassed his master by a great\\nmeasure; and this was the miraculous Raffaello Sanzio of Urbino, who\\nworked for many years under Pietro in company with his father,\\nGiovanni de\\' Santi. Another disciple of this man was Pinturicchio, a\\npainter of Perugia, who, as it has been said in his Life, ever held\\nto Pietro\\'s manner. His disciple, likewise, was Rocco Zoppo, a\\npainter of Florence, by whose hand is a very beautiful Madonna in a\\nround picture, which is in the possession of Filippo Salviati;\\nalthough it is true that it was brought to completion by Pietro\\nhimself. The same Rocco painted many pictures of Our Lady, and made\\nmany portraits, of which there is no need to speak; I will only say\\nthat in the Sistine Chapel in Rome he painted portraits of Girolamo\\nRiario and of F. Pietro, Cardinal of San Sisto. Another disciple of\\nPietro was Montevarchi, who painted many pictures in San Giovanni di\\nValdarno; more particularly, in the Madonna, the stories of the\\nMiracle of the Milk. He also left many works in Montevarchi, his\\nbirth-place. Likewise a pupil of Pietro\\'s, working with him for no\\nlittle time, was Gerino da Pistoia, of whom there has been mention\\nin the Life of Pinturicchio; and so also was Baccio Ubertino of\\nFlorence, who was most diligent both in colouring and in drawing,\\nfor which reason Pietro made much use of him. By this man\\'s hand is\\na drawing in our book, done with the pen, of Christ being scourged\\nat the Column, which is a very lovely thing.\\nA brother of this Baccio, and likewise a disciple of Pietro, was\\nFrancesco, called Il Bacchiaccha by way of surname, who was a most\\ndiligent master of little figures, as may be seen in many works\\nwrought by him in Florence, above all in the house of Giovan Maria\\nBenintendi and in that of Pier Francesco Borgherini. Bacchiaccha\\ndelighted in painting grotesques, wherefore he covered a little\\ncabinet belonging to the Lord Duke Cosimo with animals and rare\\nplants, drawn from nature, which are held very beautiful. Besides\\nthis, he made the cartoons for many tapestries, which were\\nafterwards woven in silk by the Flemish master, Giovanni Rosto, for\\nthe apartments of his Excellency\\'s Palace. Still another disciple of\\nPietro was the Spaniard Giovanni, called Lo Spagna by way of\\nsurname, who was a better colourist than any of the others whom\\nPietro left behind him at his death; after which this Giovanni would\\nhave settled in Perugia, if the envy of the painters of that city,\\nso hostile to strangers, had not persecuted him in such wise as to\\nforce him to retire to Spoleto, where, by reason of his excellence\\nand virtue, he obtained a wife of good family and was made a citizen\\nof that city. He made many works in that place, and likewise in all\\nthe other cities of Umbria; and at Assisi, in the lower Church of S.\\nFrancesco, he painted the panel of the Chapel of S. Caterina, for\\nthe Spanish Cardinal Egidio, and also one in S. Damiano. In S. Maria\\ndegli Angeli, in the little chapel where S. Francis died, he painted\\nsome half-length figures of the size of life--that is, certain\\ncompanions of S. Francis and other saints--all very lifelike, on\\neither side of a S. Francis in relief.\\nBut the best master among all the aforesaid disciples of Pietro was\\nAndrea Luigi of Assisi, called L\\'Ingegno, who in his early youth\\ncompeted with Raffaello da Urbino under the discipline of Pietro,\\nwho always employed him in the most important pictures that he made;\\nas may be seen in the Audience Chamber of the Cambio in Perugia,\\nwhere there are some very beautiful figures by his hand; in those\\nthat he wrought at Assisi; and, finally, in the Chapel of Pope\\nSixtus at Rome. In all these works Andrea gave such proof of his\\nworth, that he was expected to surpass his master by a great\\nmeasure, and so, without a doubt, it would have come to pass; but\\nfortune, which is almost always pleased to oppose herself to lofty\\nbeginnings, did not allow L\\'Ingegno to reach perfection, for a flux\\nof catarrh fell upon his eyes, whence the poor fellow became wholly\\nblind, to the infinite grief of all who knew him. Hearing of this\\nmost pitiful misfortune, Pope Sixtus, like a man who ever loved men\\nof talent, ordained that a yearly provision should be paid to Andrea\\nin Assisi during his lifetime by those who managed the revenues\\nthere; and this was done until he died at the age of eighty-six.\\nLikewise disciples of Pietro, and also natives of Perugia, were\\nEusebio San Giorgio, who painted the panel of the Magi in S.\\nAgostino; Domenico di Paris, who made many works in Perugia and in\\nthe neighbouring townships, being followed by his brother Orazio;\\nand also Gian Niccola, who painted Christ in the Garden on a panel\\nin S. Francesco, the panel of Ognissanti in the Chapel of the\\nBaglioni in S. Domenico, and stories of S. John the Baptist in\\nfresco in the Chapel of the Cambio. Benedetto Caporali, otherwise\\ncalled Bitti, was also a disciple of Pietro, and there are many\\npictures by his hand in his native city of Perugia. And he occupied\\nhimself so greatly with architecture, that he not only executed many\\nworks, but also wrote a commentary on Vitruvius in the manner that\\nall can see, for it is printed; in which studies he was followed by\\nhis son Giulio, a painter of Perugia.\\nBut not one out of all these disciples ever equalled Pietro\\'s\\ndiligence, or the grace of colouring that he showed in that manner\\nof his own, which pleased his time so much, that many came from\\nFrance, from Spain, from Germany, and from other lands, to learn it.\\nAnd a trade was done in his works, as has been said, by many who\\nsent them to diverse places, until there came the manner of\\nMichelagnolo, which, having shown the true and good path to these\\narts, has brought them to that perfection which will be seen in the\\nThird Part, about to follow, wherein we will treat of the excellence\\nand perfection of art, and show to craftsmen that he who labours and\\nstudies continuously, and not in the way of fantasy or caprice,\\nleaves true works behind him and acquires fame, wealth, and\\nfriends.\\nVITTORE SCARPACCIA (CARPACCIO), AND OTHER VENETIAN AND LOMBARD\\nPAINTERS\\nLIVES OF VITTORE SCARPACCIA (CARPACCIO), AND OF OTHER VENETIAN AND\\nLOMBARD PAINTERS\\nIt is very well known that when some of our craftsmen make a\\nbeginning in some province, they are afterwards followed by many,\\none after another; and very often there is an infinite number of\\nthem at one and the same time, for the reason that rivalry,\\nemulation, and the fact that they have been dependent on others, one\\non one excellent master, and one on another, bring it about that the\\ncraftsmen seek with all the greater effort to surpass one another,\\nto the utmost of their ability. And even when many depend on one, no\\nsooner do they separate, either at the death of their master or for\\nsome other reason, than they straightway also separate in aim;\\nwhereupon each seeks to prove his own worth, in order to appear\\nbetter than the rest and a master by himself.\\nOf many, then, who flourished almost at one and the same time and in\\none and the same province, and about whom I have not been able to\\nlearn and am not able to write every particular, I will give some\\nbrief account, to the end that, now that I find myself at the end of\\nthe Second Part of this my work, I may not omit some who have\\nlaboured to leave the world adorned by their works. Of these men, I\\nsay, besides having been unable to discover their whole history, I\\nhave not even been able to find the portraits, excepting that of\\nScarpaccia, whom for this reason I have made head of the others. Let\\nmy readers therefore accept what I can offer in this connection,\\nseeing that I cannot offer what I would wish. There lived, then, in\\nthe March of Treviso and in Lombardy, during a period of many years,\\nStefano Veronese, Aldigieri da Zevio, Jacopo Davanzo of Bologna,\\nSebeto da Verona, Jacobello de Flore, Guerriero da Padova, Giusto,\\nGirolamo Campagnola and his son Giulio, and Vincenzio Bresciano;\\nVittore, Sebastiano, and Lazzaro Scarpaccia, Venetians;\\nVincenzio Catena, Luigi Vivarini, Giovan Battista da Conigliano,\\nMarco Basarini, Giovanetto Cordegliaghi, Il Bassiti, Bartolommeo\\nVivarini, Giovanni Mansueti, Vittore Bellini, Bartolommeo Montagna\\nof Vicenza, Benedetto Diana, and Giovanni Buonconsigli, with many\\nothers, of whom there is no need to make mention here.\\nTo begin with the first, I start by saying that Stefano Veronese, of\\nwhom I gave some account in the Life of Agnolo Gaddi, was a painter\\nmore than passing good in his day. And when Donatello was working in\\nPadua, as has been already told in his Life, going on one of several\\noccasions to Verona, he was struck with marvel at the works of\\nStefano, declaring that the pictures which he had made in fresco\\nwere the best that had been wrought in those parts up to that time.\\nThe first works of this man were in the tramezzo of the Church of\\nS. Antonio at Verona, at the top of a wall on the left, below the\\ncurve of a part of the vaulting; and the subjects were a Madonna\\nwith the Child in her arms, and S. James and S. Anthony, one on\\neither side of her. This work is held very beautiful in that city\\neven at the present day, by reason of a certain liveliness that is\\nseen in the said figures, particularly in the heads, which are\\nwrought with much grace. In S. Niccolò, a parish church of that\\ncity, likewise, he painted a S. Nicholas in fresco, which is very\\nbeautiful. On the front of a house in the Via di S. Polo, which\\nleads to the Porta del Vescovo, he painted the Virgin, with certain\\nvery beautiful angels and a S. Christopher; and over the wall of the\\nChurch of S. Consolata in the Via del Duomo, in a recess made in the\\nwall, he painted a Madonna and certain birds, in particular a\\npeacock, his emblem. In S. Eufemia, a convent of the Eremite Friars\\nof S. Augustine, he painted over the side-door a S. Augustine with\\ntwo other saints, and under the mantle of this S. Augustine are many\\nfriars and nuns of his Order; but the most beautiful things in this\\nwork are two half-length prophets of the size of life, for the\\nreason that they have the most beautiful and most lifelike heads\\nthat Stefano ever made; and the colouring of the whole work,\\nhaving been executed with diligence, has remained beautiful even to\\nour own day, notwithstanding that it has been much exposed to rain,\\nwind, and frost. If this work had been under cover, it would still\\nbe as beautiful and fresh as it issued from his hands, for the\\nreason that Stefano did not retouch it on the dry, but used\\ndiligence in executing it well in fresco; as it is, it has suffered\\na little. Within the church, in the Chapel of the Sacrament--namely,\\nround the Tabernacle--he afterwards painted certain angels flying,\\nsome of whom are sounding instruments, some singing, and others\\nburning incense before the Sacrament; together with a figure of\\nJesus Christ, which he painted at the top as a finish to the\\nTabernacle. Below there are other angels, who are supporting Him,\\nclothed in white garments reaching to their feet, and ending, as it\\nwere, in clouds, which was an idea peculiar to Stefano in painting\\nfigures of angels, whom he always made most gracious in countenance\\nand very beautiful in expression. In this same work are life-size\\nfigures of S. Augustine and S. Jerome, one on either side; and these\\nare supporting with their hands the Church of God, as if to show\\nthat both of them defend Holy Church from heretics with their\\nlearning, and support her. On a pilaster of the principal chapel in\\nthe same church he painted a S. Eufemia in fresco, with a beautiful\\nand gracious expression of countenance; and there he wrote his own\\nname in letters of gold, perchance since it appeared to him to be,\\nas in fact it is, one of the best pictures that he had made; and\\naccording to his custom he painted there a very beautiful peacock,\\nand beside it two lion cubs, which are not very beautiful, because\\nat that time he could not see live ones, as he saw the peacock. He\\nalso painted for the same place a panel containing, as was the\\ncustom in those times, many half-length figures, such as S. Niccola\\nda Tolentino and others; and he filled the predella with scenes in\\nlittle figures from the life of that Saint. In S. Fermo, a church in\\nthe same city belonging to the Friars of S. Francis, he painted, as\\nan ornament for a Deposition from the Cross on the wall opposite to\\nthe side-door of entrance, twelve half-length prophets of the size\\nof life, with Adam and Eve lying below them, and his usual peacock,\\nwhich is almost the hall-mark of pictures executed by him.\\nIn Mantua, at the Martello gate of the Church of S. Domenico, the\\nsame Stefano painted a most beautiful Madonna; the head of which\\nMadonna, when they had need to build in that place, those fathers\\nplaced with care in the tramezzo of the church--that is, in the\\nChapel of S. Orsola, which belongs to the Recuperati family, and\\ncontains some pictures in fresco by the hand of the same man. And in\\nthe Church of S. Francesco, on the right hand as one enters by the\\nprincipal door, there is a row of chapels formerly built by the\\nnoble Della Ramma family, in one of which are seated figures of the\\nfour Evangelists, painted on the vaulting by the hand of Stefano;\\nand behind their shoulders, for a background, he made certain\\nespaliers of roses, with a cane trellis-work in a pattern of\\nmandorle, above which are various trees and other greenery full of\\nbirds, particularly of peacocks; and there are also some very\\nbeautiful angels. In this same church, on a column on the right hand\\nas one enters, he painted a life-size figure of S. Mary Magdalene.\\nAnd in the same city, on the frontal of a door in the street called\\nRompilanza, he painted in fresco a Madonna with the Child in her\\narms, and some angels kneeling before her; and the background he\\nmade of trees covered with fruit.\\nThese, then, are the works that are found to have been executed by\\nStefano, although it may well be believed, since his life was not a\\nshort one, that he made many others. But even as I have not been\\nable to discover any more of them, so I have failed to find his\\nsurname, his father\\'s name, his portrait, or any other particulars.\\nSome declare that before he came to Florence he was a disciple of\\nMaestro Liberale, a painter of Verona; but this matters nothing. It\\nis enough that he learnt all that there was of the good in him from\\nAgnolo Gaddi in Florence.\\nOf the same city of Verona was Aldigieri da Zevio, who was very much\\nthe friend of the Signori della Scala, and who, besides many other\\nworks, painted the Great Hall of their Palace (which is now the\\nhabitation of the Podestà), depicting therein the War of Jerusalem,\\naccording as it is described by Josephus. In this work Aldigieri\\nshowed great spirit and judgment, distributing one scene over the\\nwalls of that hall on every side, with a single ornament encircling\\nit right round; on the upper part of which ornament, as it were to\\nset it off, he placed a row of medallions, in which it is believed\\nthat there are the portraits from life of many distinguished men of\\nthose times, particularly of many of those Signori della Scala; but,\\nsince the truth about this is not known, I will say no more of it. I\\nmust say, indeed, that Aldigieri showed in this work that he had\\nintelligence, judgment, and invention, seeing that he took into\\nconsideration all the things that can be taken into consideration in\\na serious war. Besides this, the colouring has remained very fresh;\\nand among many portraits of men of distinction and learning, there\\nis seen that of Messer Francesco Petrarca.\\nJacopo Avanzi, a painter of Bologna, shared the work of this hall\\nwith Aldigieri, and below the aforesaid pictures he painted two most\\nbeautiful Triumphs, likewise in fresco, with so much art and so good\\na manner, that Girolamo Campagnola declares that Mantegna used to\\npraise them as pictures of the rarest merit. The same Jacopo,\\ntogether with Aldigieri and Sebeto da Verona, painted the Chapel of\\nS. Giorgio, which is beside the Church of S. Antonio, in Padua,\\naccording to the directions left in the testaments of the Marquesses\\nof Carrara. Jacopo Avanzi painted the upper part; below this were\\ncertain stories of S. Lucia, with a Last Supper, by Aldigieri; and\\nSebeto painted stories of S. John. Afterwards these three masters,\\nhaving all returned to Verona, joined together to paint a\\nwedding-feast, with many portraits and costumes of those times, in\\nthe house of the Counts Serenghi. Now the work of Jacopo Avanzi was\\nheld to be the best of all; but, since mention has been made of him\\nin the Life of Niccolò d\\' Arezzo by reason of the works that he made\\nin Bologna in competition with the painters Simone, Cristofano, and\\nGalasso, I will say no more about him in this place.\\nA man who was held in esteem at Venice about the same time, although\\nhe adhered to the Greek manner, was Jacobello de Flore, who made a\\nnumber of works in that city; in particular, a panel for the Nuns of\\nthe Corpus Domini, which stands on the altar of S. Domenico in their\\nchurch. A competitor of this master was Giromin Morzone, who painted\\na number of pictures in Venice and in many cities of Lombardy; but,\\nsince he held to the old manner and made all his figures on tiptoe,\\nwe will say nothing about him, save that there is a panel by his\\nhand, with many saints, on the Altar of the Assumption in the Church\\nof S. Lena.\\nA much better master than Morzone was Guerriero, a painter of Padua,\\nwho, besides many other works, painted the principal chapel of the\\nEremite Friars of S. Augustine in Padua, and a chapel for the same\\nfriars in the first cloister. He also painted a little chapel in the\\nhouse of the Urban Prefect, and the Hall of the Roman Emperors,\\nwhere the students go to dance at the time of the Carnival. He also\\npainted in fresco, in the Chapel of the Podestà of the same city,\\nsome scenes from the Old Testament.\\nGiusto, likewise a painter of Padua, painted in the Chapel of S.\\nGiovanni Battista, without the Church of the Vescovado, not only\\ncertain scenes from the Old Testament and the New, but also the\\nRevelations of the Apocalypse of S. John the Evangelist; and in the\\nupper part he made a Paradise containing many choirs of angels and\\nother adornments, wrought with beautiful conceptions. In the Church\\nof S. Antonio he painted in fresco the Chapel of S. Luca; and in a\\nchapel in the Church of the Eremite Friars of S. Augustine he\\npainted the liberal arts, with the virtues and vices beside them,\\nand likewise those who have been celebrated for their virtues, and\\nthose who have fallen by reason of their vices into the extreme of\\nmisery and into the lowest depth of Hell.\\nThere was working in Padua, in this man\\'s time, Stefano, a painter\\nof Ferrara, who, as has been said elsewhere, adorned with various\\npictures the chapel and the tomb wherein is the body of S. Anthony,\\nand also painted the Virgin Mary that is called the Vergine del\\nPilastro.\\nAnother man who was held in esteem in the same times was Vincenzio,\\na painter of Brescia, according to the account of Filarete, as was\\nalso Girolamo Campagnola, another Paduan painter, and a disciple of\\nSquarcione. Then Giulio, son of Girolamo, made many beautiful works\\nof painting, illumination, and copper-engraving, both in Padua and\\nin other places. In the same city of Padua many things were\\nwrought by Niccolò Moreto, who lived eighty years, and never ceased\\nto exercise his art.\\nBesides these there were many others, who were connected with\\nGentile and Giovanni Bellini; but Vittore Scarpaccia was truly the\\nfirst among them who made works of importance. His first works were\\nin the Scuola of S. Orsola, where he painted on canvas the greater\\npart of the stories that are there, representing the life and death\\nof that Saint; the labours of which pictures he contrived to carry\\nout so well and with such great diligence and art, that he acquired\\nthereby the name of a very good and practised master. This, so it is\\nsaid, was the reason that the people of Milan caused him to paint a\\npanel in distemper with many figures for the Friars Minor, in their\\nChapel of S. Ambrogio. On the altar of the Risen Christ in the\\nChurch of S. Antonio he painted the scene of Christ appearing to the\\nMagdalene and the other Maries, in which he made a very beautiful\\nview in perspective of a landscape receding into the distance; and\\nin another chapel he painted the story of the Martyrs--that is,\\ntheir crucifixion--in which work he made more than three hundred\\nfigures, what with the large and the small, besides a number of\\nhorses and trees, an open Heaven, figures both nude and clothed in\\ndiverse attitudes, many foreshortenings, and so many other things,\\nthat it can be seen that he did not execute it without extraordinary\\nlabour. For the altar of the Madonna, in the Church of S. Giobbe in\\nCanareio, he painted her presenting the Infant Christ to Simeon, and\\ndepicted the Madonna herself standing, and Simeon in his cope\\nbetween two ministers clothed as Cardinals; behind the Virgin are\\ntwo women, one of whom has two doves, and below are three boys, who\\nare playing on a lute, a serpent, and a lyre, or rather a viol; and\\nthe colouring of the whole panel is very charming and beautiful.\\nAnd, in truth, Vittore was a very diligent and practised master, and\\nmany pictures by his hand that are in Venice, both portraits from\\nlife and other kinds, are much esteemed for works wrought in those\\ntimes. He taught his art to two brothers of his own, who imitated\\nhim closely, one being Lazzaro, and the other Sebastiano; and by\\ntheir hand is a panel on the altar of the Virgin in the Church of\\nthe Nuns of the Corpus Domini, showing her seated between S.\\nCatherine and S. Martha, with other female saints, two angels who\\nare sounding instruments, and a very beautiful view of buildings in\\nperspective as a background to the whole work, of which we have the\\noriginal drawings, by the hand of these men, in our book.\\nAnother passing good painter in the time of these masters was\\nVincenzio Catena, who occupied himself much more with making\\nportraits from the life than with any other sort of painting; and,\\nin truth, some that are to be seen by his hand are marvellous--among\\nothers, that of a German of the Fugger family, a man of rank and\\nimportance, who was then living in the Fondaco de\\' Tedeschi at\\nVenice, was painted with great vivacity.\\nAnother man who made many works in Venice, about the same time, was\\na disciple of Giovanni Bellini, Giovan Battista da Conigliano, by\\nwhose hand is a panel on the altar of S. Pietro Martire in the\\naforesaid Church of the Nuns of the Corpus Domini, containing the\\nsaid Saint, S. Nicholas, and S. Benedict, with landscapes in\\nperspective, an angel tuning a cithern, and many little figures more\\nthan passing good. And if this man had not died young, it may be\\nbelieved that he would have equalled his master.\\nThe name of a master not otherwise than good, likewise, in the same\\nart and at the same time, was enjoyed by Marco Basarini, who,\\npainting in Venice, where he was born from a Greek father and\\nmother, executed in S. Francesco della Vigna a panel with a\\nDeposition of Christ from the Cross, and another panel in the Church\\nof S. Giobbe, representing Christ in the Garden, and below Him the\\nthree Apostles, who are sleeping, and S. Francis, S. Dominic, and\\ntwo other saints; but what was most praised in this work was a\\nlandscape with many little figures wrought with good grace. In that\\nsame church the same Marco painted S. Bernardino on a rock, with\\nother saints.\\nGiovanetto Cordegliaghi made an infinity of devotional pictures in\\nthe same city; nay, he scarcely worked at anything else, and, in\\ntruth, he had in this sort of painting a very delicate and sweet\\nmanner, no little better than that of the aforesaid masters. In S.\\nPantaleone, in a chapel beside the principal one, this man\\npainted S. Peter making disputation with two other saints, who are\\nwearing most beautiful draperies, and are wrought with a beautiful\\nmanner.\\nMarco Bassiti was in good repute almost at the same time, and by his\\nhand is a large panel in the Church of the Carthusian Monks at\\nVenice, in which he painted Christ between Peter and Andrew on the\\nSea of Tiberias, with the sons of Zebedee; making therein an arm of\\nthe sea, a mountain, and part of a city, with many persons in the\\nform of little figures. Many other works by this man could be\\nenumerated, but let it be enough to have spoken of this one, which\\nis the best.\\nBartolommeo Vivarini of Murano also acquitted himself very well in\\nthe works that he made, as may be seen, besides many other examples,\\nin the panel that he executed for the altar of S. Luigi in the\\nChurch of SS. Giovanni e Polo; in which panel he portrayed the said\\nS. Luigi seated, wearing the cope, with S. Gregory, S. Sebastian,\\nand S. Dominic on one side of him, and on the other side S.\\nNicholas, S. Jerome, and S. Rocco, and above them half-length\\nfigures of other saints.\\nAnother man who executed his pictures very well, taking much delight\\nin counterfeiting things of nature, figures, and distant landscapes,\\nwas Giovanni Mansueti, who, imitating the works of Gentile Bellini\\nnot a little, made many pictures in Venice. At the upper end of the\\nAudience Chamber of the Scuola of S. Marco he painted a S. Mark\\npreaching on the Piazza; in which picture he painted the façade of\\nthe church, and, among the multitude of men and women who are\\nlistening to the Saint, Turks, Greeks, and the faces of men of\\ndiverse nations, with bizarre costumes. In the same place, in\\nanother scene wherein he painted S. Mark healing a sick man, he made\\na perspective view of two staircases and many loggie. In another\\npicture, near to that one, he made a S. Mark converting an infinite\\nmultitude to the faith of Christ; in this he made an open temple,\\nwith a Crucifix on an altar, and throughout the whole work there are\\ndiverse persons with a beautiful variety of expression, dress, and\\nfeatures.\\nThe work in the same place was continued after him by Vittore\\nBellini, who made a view of buildings in perspective, which is\\npassing good, in a scene wherein S. Mark is taken prisoner and\\nbound, with a number of figures, in which he imitated his\\npredecessors. After these men came Bartolommeo Montagna of Vicenza,\\na passing good painter, who lived ever in Venice and made many\\npictures there; and he painted a panel in the Church of S. Maria d\\'\\nArtone at Padua. Benedetto Diana, likewise, was a painter no less\\nesteemed than the masters mentioned above, as is proved, to say\\nnothing of his other works, by those from his hand that are in S.\\nFrancesco della Vigna at Venice, where, for the altar of S.\\nGiovanni, he painted that Saint standing between two other saints,\\neach of whom has a book in his hand.\\nAnother man who was accounted a good master was Giovanni\\nBuonconsigli, who painted a picture in the Church of SS. Giovanni e\\nPolo for the altar of S. Tommaso d\\' Aquino, showing that Saint\\nsurrounded by many figures, to whom he is reading the Holy\\nScriptures; and he made therein a perspective view of buildings,\\nwhich is not otherwise than worthy of praise. There also lived in\\nVenice throughout almost the whole course of his life the Florentine\\nsculptor, Simon Bianco, as did Tullio Lombardo, an excellent master\\nof intaglio.\\nIn Lombardy, likewise, there were excellent sculptors in Bartolommeo\\nClemente of Reggio and Agostino Busto; and, in intaglio, Jacopo\\nDavanzo of Milan, with Gasparo and Girolamo Misceroni. In Brescia\\nthere was a man who was able and masterly at working in fresco,\\ncalled Vincenzio Verchio, who acquired a very great name in his\\nnative place by reason of his beautiful works. The same did Girolamo\\nRomanino, a fine master of design, as is clearly demonstrated by the\\nworks made by him in Brescia and in the neighbourhood for many miles\\naround. And not inferior to these--nay, even superior--was\\nAlessandro Moretto, who was very delicate in his colouring, and much\\nthe friend of diligence, as the works made by him demonstrate.\\nBut to return to Verona, in which city there have flourished\\nexcellent craftsmen, even as they flourish more than ever to-day;\\nthere, in times past, were excellent masters in Francesco Bonsignori\\nand Francesco Caroto, and afterwards Maestro Zeno of Verona, who\\npainted the panel of S. Marino in Rimini, with two others, all with\\nmuch diligence. But the man who surpassed all others in making\\ncertain marvellous figures from life was Il Moro of Verona, or\\nrather, as others called him, Francesco Turbido, by whose hand is a\\nportrait now in the house of Monsignor de\\' Martini at Venice, of a\\ngentleman of the house of Badovaro, painted in the character of a\\nshepherd; which portrait appears absolutely alive, and can challenge\\ncomparison with any of the great number that have been seen in these\\nparts. Battista d\\' Angelo, son-in-law of this Francesco, is also so\\nlovely in colouring and so masterly in drawing, that he is rather\\nsuperior than inferior to his father-in-law. But since it is not my\\nintention to speak at present of the living, it must suffice me to\\nhave spoken in this place of some with regard to whose lives, as I\\nsaid at the beginning of this Life, I have not been able to discover\\nevery particular with equal minuteness, to the end that their\\ntalents and merits may receive from me at least all that little\\nwhich I, who would fain make it much, am able to give them.\\nJACOPO, CALLED L\\'', \"JACOPO, CALLED L'INDACO\\nPAINTER\\nJacopo, called L'Indaco, who was a disciple of Domenico del\\nGhirlandajo, and who worked in Rome with Pinturicchio, was a passing\\ngood master in his day; and although he did not make many works, yet\\nthose that he did make are worthy of commendation. Nor is there any\\nneed to marvel that only very few works issued from his hands, for\\nthe reason that, being a gay and humorous fellow and a lover of good\\ncheer, he harboured but few thoughts and would never work save when\\nhe could not help it; and so he used to say that doing nothing else\\nbut labour, without taking a little pleasure in the world, was no\\nlife for a Christian. He lived in close intimacy with Michelagnolo,\\nfor when that craftsman, supremely excellent beyond all who have\\never lived, wished to have some recreation after his studies and his\\ncontinuous labours of body and mind, no one was more pleasing to him\\nfor the purpose or more suited to his humour than this man.\\nJacopo worked for many years in Rome, or, to be more precise, he\\nlived many years in Rome, working very little. By his hand, in that\\ncity, is the first chapel on the right hand as one enters the Church\\nof S. Agostino by the door of the façade; on the vaulting of which\\nchapel are the Apostles receiving the Holy Spirit, and on the wall\\nbelow are two stories of Christ--in one His taking Peter and Andrew\\nfrom their nets, and in the other the Feast of Simon and the\\nMagdalene, in which there is a ceiling of planks and beams,\\ncounterfeited very well. In the panel of the same chapel, which he\\npainted in oil, is a Dead Christ, wrought and executed with much\\nmastery and diligence. In the Trinità at Rome, likewise, there is a\\nlittle panel by his hand with the Coronation of Our Lady. But what\\nneed is there to say more about this man? What more, indeed, is\\nthere to say? It is enough that he loved gossiping as much as he\\nalways hated working and painting.\\nNow seeing that, as has been said, Michelagnolo used to take\\npleasure in this man's chattering and in the jokes that he was ever\\nmaking, he kept him almost always at his table; but one day Jacopo\\nwearied him--as such fellows more often than not do come to weary\\ntheir friends and patrons with their incessant babbling, so often\\nill-timed and senseless; babbling, I call it, for reasonable talk it\\ncannot be called, since for the most part there is neither reason\\nnor judgment in such people--and Michelagnolo, who, perchance, had\\nother thoughts in his mind at the time and wished to get rid of him,\\nsent him to buy some figs; and no sooner had Jacopo left the house\\nthan Michelagnolo bolted the door behind him, determined not to open\\nto him when he came back. L'Indaco, then, on returning from the\\nmarket-square, perceived, after having knocked at the door for a\\ntime in vain, that Michelagnolo did not intend to open to him;\\nwhereupon, flying into a rage, he took the figs and the leaves and\\nspread them all over the threshold of the door. This done, he went\\nhis way and for many months refused to speak to Michelagnolo; but at\\nlast, becoming reconciled with him, he was more his friend than\\never. Finally, having reached the age of sixty-eight, he died in\\nRome.\\nNot unlike Jacopo was a younger brother of his, whose proper name\\nwas Francesco, although he too was afterwards called L'Indaco by way\\nof surname; and he, likewise, was a painter, and more than passing\\ngood. He was not unlike Jacopo--I mean, in his unwillingness to work\\n(to say the least), and in his love of talking--but in one respect\\nhe surpassed Jacopo, for he was ever speaking evil of everyone and\\ndecrying the works of every craftsman. This man, after having\\nwrought certain things in Montepulciano both in painting and in\\nclay, painted a little panel for the Audience Chamber of the Company\\nof the Nunziata in Arezzo, containing an Annunciation, and a God the\\nFather in Heaven surrounded by many angels in the form of children.\\nAnd in the same city, on the first occasion when Duke Alessandro\\nwent there, he made a most beautiful triumphal arch, with many\\nfigures in relief, at the gate of the Palazzo de' Signori; and also,\\nin competition with other painters who executed a number of other\\nworks for the entry of the said Duke, the scenery for the\\nrepresentation of a play, which was held to be very beautiful.\\nAfterwards, having gone to Rome at the time when the Emperor Charles\\nV was expected there, he made some figures in clay, and a coat of\\narms in fresco for the Roman people on the Campidoglio, which was\\nmuch extolled. But the best work that ever issued from the hands of\\nthis master, and the most highly praised, was a little study wrought\\nin stucco for the Duchess Margherita of Austria in the Palace of the\\nMedici at Rome--a thing so beautiful and so ornate that there is\\nnothing better to be seen; nor do I believe that it is possible, in\\na certain sense, to do with silver what L'Indaco did in this work\\nwith stucco. From these things it may be judged that if this man had\\ntaken pleasure in work and had made use of his intelligence, he\\nwould have become excellent.\\nFrancesco drew passing well, but Jacopo much better, as may be seen\\nin our book.\", 'LUCA SIGNORELLI OF CORTONA\\n[_LUCA DA CORTONA_]\\nPAINTER\\nLuca Signorelli, an excellent painter, of whom, according to the\\norder of time, we have now to speak, was more famous throughout\\nItaly in his day, and his works were held in greater price than has\\never been the case with any other master at any time whatsoever, for\\nthe reason that in the works that he executed in painting he showed\\nthe true method of making nudes, and how they can be caused,\\nalthough only with art and difficulty, to appear alive. He was a\\npupil and disciple of Piero dal Borgo a San Sepolcro, and greatly\\ndid he strive in his youth to imitate his master, and even to\\nsurpass him; and the while that he was working with Piero at Arezzo,\\nliving in the house of his uncle Lazzaro Vasari, as it has been\\ntold, he imitated the manner of the said Piero so well that the one\\ncould scarcely be distinguished from the other.\\nThe first works of Luca were in S. Lorenzo at Arezzo, where he\\npainted the Chapel of S. Barbara in fresco in the year 1472; and he\\npainted for the Company of S. Caterina, on cloth and in oil, the\\nbanner that is borne in processions, and likewise that of the\\nTrinità, although this does not appear to be by the hand of Luca,\\nbut by Piero dal Borgo himself. In S. Agostino in the same city he\\npainted the panel of S. Niccola da Tolentino, with most beautiful\\nlittle scenes, executing the work with good drawing and invention;\\nand in the same place, in the Chapel of the Sacrament, he made two\\nangels wrought in fresco. In the Chapel of the Accolti in the Church\\nof S. Francesco, for Messer Francesco, Doctor of Laws, he painted a\\npanel in which he portrayed the said Messer Francesco with some of\\nhis relatives. In this work is a S. Michael weighing souls, who is\\nadmirable; and in him there is seen the knowledge of Luca, both in\\nthe splendour of his armour and in the reflected lights, and, in\\nshort, throughout the whole work. In his hands he placed a pair of\\nscales, in which are nude figures, very beautifully foreshortened,\\none going up and the other down; and among other ingenious things\\nthat are in this picture is a nude figure most skilfully transformed\\ninto a devil, with a lizard licking the blood from a wound in its\\nbody. Besides this, there is a Madonna with the Child on her lap,\\nwith S. Stephen, S. Laurence, S. Catherine, and two angels, of whom\\none is playing on a lute and the other on a rebec; and all these\\nfigures are draped and adorned so beautifully that it is a marvel.\\nBut the most miraculous part of this panel is the predella, which is\\nfull of Friars of the said S. Catherine in the form of little\\nfigures.\\nIn Perugia, also, he made many works; among others, a panel in the\\nDuomo for Messer Jacopo Vannucci of Cortona, Bishop of that city; in\\nwhich panel are Our Lady, S. Onofrio, S. Ercolano, S. John the\\nBaptist, and S. Stephen, with a most beautiful angel, who is tuning\\na lute. At Volterra, over the altar of a Company in the Church of S.\\nFrancesco, he painted in fresco the Circumcision of Our Lord, which\\nis considered beautiful to a marvel, although the Infant, having\\nbeen injured by damp, was restored by Sodoma and made much less\\nbeautiful than before. And, in truth, it would be sometimes better\\nto leave works half spoilt, when they have been made by men of\\nexcellence, rather than to have them retouched by inferior masters.\\nIn S. Agostino in the same city he painted a panel in distemper, and\\nthe predella of little figures, with stories of the Passion of\\nChrist; and this is held to be extraordinarily beautiful. At S.\\nMaria a Monte he painted a Dead Christ on a panel for the monks of\\nthat place; and at Città di Castello a Nativity of Christ in S.\\nFrancesco, with a S. Sebastian on another panel in S. Domenico. In\\nS. Margherita, a seat of the Frati del Zoccolo in his native city of\\nCortona, he painted a Dead Christ, one of the rarest of his works;\\nand for the Company of the Gesù, in the same city, he executed three\\npanels, of which the one that is on the high-altar is marvellous,\\nshowing Christ administering the Sacrament to the Apostles, and\\nJudas placing the Host into his wallet. In the Pieve, now called\\nthe Vescovado, in the Chapel of the Sacrament, he painted some\\nlife-size prophets in fresco; and round the tabernacle are some\\nangels who are opening out a canopy, with S. Jerome and S. Thomas\\nAquinas at the sides. For the high-altar of the said church he\\npainted a panel with a most beautiful Assumption, and he designed\\nthe pictures for the principal round window of the same church;\\nwhich pictures were afterwards executed by Stagio Sassoli of Arezzo.\\nIn Castiglione Aretino he made a Dead Christ, with the Maries, over\\nthe Chapel of the Sacrament; and in S. Francesco, at Lucignano, he\\npainted the folding-doors of a press, wherein there is a tree of\\ncoral surmounted by a cross. At Siena, in the Chapel of S.\\nCristofano in S. Agostino, he painted a panel with some saints, in\\nthe midst of whom is a S. Cristopher in relief.\\nHaving gone from Siena to Florence in order to see both the works of\\nthose masters who were then living and those of many already dead,\\nhe painted for Lorenzo de\\' Medici certain nude gods on a canvas, for\\nwhich he was much commended, and a picture of Our Lady with two\\nlittle prophets in terretta, which is now at Castello, a villa of\\nDuke Cosimo\\'s. These works, both the one and the other, he presented\\nto the said Lorenzo, who would never be beaten by any man in\\nliberality and magnificence. He also painted a round picture of Our\\nLady, which is in the Audience Chamber of the Captains of the Guelph\\nparty--a very beautiful work. At Chiusuri in the district of Siena,\\nthe principal seat of the Monks of Monte Oliveto, he painted eleven\\nscenes of the life and acts of S. Benedict on one side of the\\ncloister. And from Cortona he sent some of his works to\\nMontepulciano; to Foiano the panel which is on the high-altar of the\\nPieve; and other works to other places in Valdichiana. In the\\nMadonna, the principal church of Orvieto, he finished with his own\\nhand the chapel that Fra Giovanni da Fiesole had formerly begun\\nthere; in which chapel he painted all the scenes of the end of the\\nworld with bizarre and fantastic invention--angels, demons, ruins,\\nearthquakes, fires, miracles of Antichrist, and many other similar\\nthings besides, such as nudes, foreshortenings, and many beautiful\\nfigures; imagining the terror that there shall be on that last and\\nawful day. By means of this he encouraged all those who have lived\\nafter him, insomuch that since then they have found easy the\\ndifficulties of that manner; wherefore I do not marvel that the\\nworks of Luca were ever very highly extolled by Michelagnolo, nor\\nthat in certain parts of his divine Judgment, which he made in the\\nchapel, he should have deigned to avail himself in some measure of\\nthe inventions of Luca, as he did in the angels, the demons, the\\ndivision of the Heavens, and other things, in which Michelagnolo\\nhimself imitated Luca\\'s method, as all may see. In this work Luca\\nportrayed himself and many of his friends; Niccolò, Paolo, and\\nVitelozzo Vitelli, Giovan Paolo and Orazio Baglioni, and others\\nwhose names are not known. In the Sacristy of S. Maria at Loreto he\\npainted in fresco the four Evangelists, the four Doctors, and other\\nsaints, all very beautiful; and for this work he was liberally\\nrewarded by Pope Sixtus.\\nIt is said that a son of his, most beautiful in countenance and in\\nperson, whom he loved dearly, was killed at Cortona; and that Luca,\\nheart-broken as he was, had him stripped naked, and with the\\ngreatest firmness of soul, without lamenting or shedding a tear,\\nportrayed him, to the end that, whenever he might wish, he might be\\nable by means of the work of his own hands to see that which nature\\nhad given him and adverse fortune had snatched away.\\nBeing then summoned by the said Pope Sixtus to work in the chapel of\\nhis Palace in competition with many other painters, he painted\\ntherein two scenes, which are held the best among so many; one is\\nMoses declaring his testament to the Jewish people on having seen\\nthe Promised Land, and the other is his death.\\nFinally, having executed works for almost every Prince in Italy, and\\nbeing now old, he returned to Cortona, where, in those last years of\\nhis life, he worked more for pleasure than for any other reason, as\\none who, being used to labour, neither could nor would stay idle. In\\nthis his old age, then, he painted a panel for the Nuns of S.\\nMargherita at Arezzo, and one for the Company of S. Girolamo, which\\nwas paid for in part by Messer Niccolò Gamurrini, Doctor of Laws and\\nAuditor of the Ruota, who is portrayed from life in that\\npanel, kneeling before the Madonna, to whom he is being presented by\\na S. Nicholas who is in the same panel; there are also S. Donatus\\nand S. Stephen, and lower down a nude S. Jerome, and a David who is\\nsinging to a psaltery; and also two prophets, who, as it appears\\nfrom the scrolls that they have in their hands, are speaking about\\nthe Conception. This work was brought from Cortona to Arezzo on the\\nshoulders of the men of that Company; and Luca, old as he was,\\ninsisted on coming to set it in place, and partly also in order to\\nrevisit his friends and relatives. And since he lodged in the house\\nof the Vasari, in which I then was, a little boy of eight years old,\\nI remember that the good old man, who was most gracious and\\ncourteous, having heard from the master who was teaching me my first\\nletters, that I gave my attention to nothing in lesson-time save to\\ndrawing figures, I remember, I say, that he turned to my father\\nAntonio and said to him: \"Antonio, if you wish little Giorgio not to\\nbecome backward, by all means let him learn to draw, for, even were\\nhe to devote himself to letters, design cannot be otherwise than\\nhelpful, honourable, and advantageous to him, as it is to every\\ngentleman.\" Then, turning to me, who was standing in front of him,\\nhe said: \"Mind your lessons, little kinsman.\" He said many other\\nthings about me, which I withhold, for the reason that I know that I\\nhave failed by a great measure to justify the opinion which the good\\nold man had of me. And since he heard, as was true, that the blood\\nused to flow from my nose at that age in such quantities that this\\nleft me sometimes half dead, with infinite lovingness he bound a\\njasper round my neck with his own hand; and this memory of Luca will\\nstay for ever fixed in my mind. The said panel set in place, he\\nreturned to Cortona, accompanied for a great part of the way by many\\ncitizens, friends, and relatives, as was due to the excellence of\\nLuca, who always lived rather as a noble and a man of rank than as a\\npainter.\\nAbout the same time a palace had been built for Cardinal Silvio\\nPasserini of Cortona, half a mile beyond the city, by Benedetto\\nCaporali, a painter of Perugia, who, delighting in architecture, had\\nwritten a commentary on Vitruvius a short time before; and the said\\nCardinal determined to have almost the whole of it painted.\\nWherefore Benedetto, putting his hand to this with the aid of Maso\\nPapacello of Cortona (who was his disciple and had also learnt not a\\nlittle from Giulio Romano, as will be told), of Tommaso, and of\\nother disciples and lads, did not cease until he had painted it\\nalmost all over in fresco. But the Cardinal wishing to have some\\npainting by the hand of Luca as well, he, old as he was, and\\nhindered by palsy, painted in fresco, on the altar-wall of the\\nchapel of that palace, the scene of S. John the Baptist baptizing\\nthe Saviour; but he was not able to finish it completely, for while\\nstill working at it he died, having reached the age of eighty-two.\\nLuca was a man of most excellent character, true and loving with his\\nfriends, sweet and amiable in his dealings with every man, and,\\nabove all, courteous to all who had need of him, and kindly in\\nteaching his disciples. He lived splendidly, and he took delight in\\nclothing himself well. And for these good qualities he was ever held\\nin the highest veneration both in his own country and abroad.\\nAnd so, with the end of this master\\'s life, which was in 1521, we\\nwill bring to an end the Second Part of these Lives; concluding with\\nLuca, as the man who, with his profound mastery of design,\\nparticularly in nudes, and with his grace in invention and in the\\ncomposition of scenes, opened to the majority of craftsmen the way\\nto the final perfection of art, to which those men who followed were\\nafterwards enabled to add the crown, of whom we are henceforward to\\nspeak.\\n     THE THIRD PART OF THE LIVES OF THE SCULPTORS, PAINTERS, AND\\n     ARCHITECTS, WHO HAVE LIVED FROM CIMABUE TO OUR OWN DAY. WRITTEN\\n     BY MESSER GIORGIO VASARI, PAINTER AND ARCHITECT OF AREZZO\\nPREFACE TO THE THIRD PART\\nTruly great was the advancement conferred on the arts of\\narchitecture, painting, and sculpture by those excellent masters of\\nwhom we have written hitherto, in the Second Part of these Lives,\\nfor to the achievements of the early masters they added rule, order,\\nproportion, draughtsmanship, and manner; not, indeed, in complete\\nperfection, but with so near an approach to the truth that the\\nmasters of the third age, of whom we are henceforward to speak, were\\nenabled, by means of their light, to aspire still higher and attain\\nto that supreme perfection which we see in the most highly prized\\nand most celebrated of our modern works. But to the end that the\\nnature of the improvement brought about by the aforesaid craftsmen\\nmay be even more clearly understood, it will certainly not be out of\\nplace to explain in a few words the five additions that I have\\nnamed, and to give a succinct account of the origin of that true\\nexcellence which, having surpassed the age of the ancients, makes\\nthe modern so glorious.\\nRule, then, in architecture, was the process of taking measurements\\nfrom antiquities and studying the ground-plans of ancient edifices\\nfor the construction of modern buildings. Order was the separating\\nof one style from another, so that each body should receive its\\nproper members, with no more interchanging between Doric, Ionic,\\nCorinthian, and Tuscan. Proportion was the universal law applying\\nboth to architecture and to sculpture, that all bodies should be\\nmade correct and true, with the members in proper harmony; and so,\\nalso, in painting. Draughtsmanship was the imitation of the most\\nbeautiful parts of nature in all figures, whether in sculpture or in\\npainting; and for this it is necessary to have a hand and a brain\\nable to reproduce with absolute accuracy and precision, on a level\\nsurface--whether by drawing on paper, or on panel, or on some other\\nlevel surface--everything that the eye sees; and the same is true of\\nrelief in sculpture. Manner then attained to the greatest beauty\\nfrom the practice which arose of constantly copying the most\\nbeautiful objects, and joining together these most beautiful things,\\nhands, heads, bodies, and legs, so as to make a figure of the\\ngreatest possible beauty. This practice was carried out in every\\nwork for all figures, and for that reason it is called the beautiful\\nmanner.\\nThese things had not been done by Giotto or by the other early\\ncraftsmen, although they had discovered the rudiments of all these\\ndifficulties, and had touched them on the surface; as in their\\ndrawing, which was sounder and more true to nature than it had been\\nbefore, and likewise in harmony of colouring and in the grouping of\\nfigures in scenes, and in many other respects of which enough has\\nbeen said. Now although the masters of the second age improved our\\narts greatly with regard to all the qualities mentioned above, yet\\nthese were not made by them so perfect as to succeed in attaining to\\ncomplete perfection, for there was wanting in their rule a certain\\nfreedom which, without being of the rule, might be directed by the\\nrule and might be able to exist without causing confusion or\\nspoiling the order; which order had need of an invention abundant in\\nevery respect, and of a certain beauty maintained in every least\\ndetail, so as to reveal all that order with more adornment. In\\nproportion there was wanting a certain correctness of judgment, by\\nmeans of which their figures, without having been measured, might\\nhave, in due relation to their dimensions, a grace exceeding\\nmeasurement. In their drawing there was not the perfection of\\nfinish, because, although they made an arm round and a leg straight,\\nthe muscles in these were not revealed with that sweet and facile\\ngrace which hovers midway between the seen and the unseen, as is the\\ncase with the flesh of living figures; nay, they were crude and\\nexcoriated, which made them displeasing to the eye and gave hardness\\nto the manner. This last was wanting in the delicacy that comes from\\nmaking all figures light and graceful, particularly those of women\\nand children, with the limbs true to nature, as in the case of men,\\nbut veiled with a plumpness and fleshiness that should not be\\nawkward, as they are in nature, but refined by draughtsmanship and\\njudgment. They also lacked our abundance of beautiful costumes, our\\ngreat number and variety of bizarre fancies, loveliness of\\ncolouring, wide knowledge of buildings, and distance and variety in\\nlandscapes. And although many of them, such as Andrea Verrocchio and\\nAntonio del Pollaiuolo, and many others more modern, began to seek\\nto make their figures with more study, so as to reveal in them\\nbetter draughtsmanship, with a degree of imitation more correct and\\ntruer to nature, nevertheless the whole was not yet there, even\\nthough they had one very certain assurance--namely, that they were\\nadvancing towards the good, and their figures were thus approved\\naccording to the standard of the works of the ancients, as was seen\\nwhen Andrea Verrocchio restored in marble the legs and arms of the\\nMarsyas in the house of the Medici in Florence. But they lacked a\\ncertain finish and finality of perfection in the feet, hands, hair,\\nand beards, although the limbs as a whole are in accordance with the\\nantique and have a certain correct harmony in the proportions. Now\\nif they had had that minuteness of finish which is the perfection\\nand bloom of art, they would also have had a resolute boldness in\\ntheir works; and from this there would have followed delicacy,\\nrefinement, and supreme grace, which are the qualities produced by\\nthe perfection of art in beautiful figures, whether in relief or in\\npainting; but these qualities they did not have, although they give\\nproof of diligent striving. That finish, and that certain something\\nthat they lacked, they could not achieve so readily, seeing that\\nstudy, when it is used in that way to obtain finish, gives dryness\\nto the manner.\\nAfter them, indeed, their successors were enabled to attain to it\\nthrough seeing excavated out of the earth certain antiquities cited\\nby Pliny as amongst the most famous, such as the Laocoon, the\\nHercules, the Great Torso of the Belvedere, and likewise the Venus,\\nthe Cleopatra, the Apollo, and an endless number of others, which,\\nboth with their sweetness and their severity, with their fleshy\\nroundness copied from the greatest beauties of nature, and with\\ncertain attitudes which involve no distortion of the whole figure\\nbut only a movement of certain parts, and are revealed with a most\\nperfect grace, brought about the disappearance of a certain dryness,\\nhardness, and sharpness of manner, which had been left to our art by\\nthe excessive study of Piero della Francesca, Lazzaro Vasari, Alesso\\nBaldovinetti, Andrea dal Castagno, Pesello, Ercole Ferrarese,\\nGiovanni Bellini, Cosimo Rosselli, the Abbot of S. Clemente,\\nDomenico del Ghirlandajo, Sandro Botticelli, Andrea Mantegna,\\nFilippo, and Luca Signorelli. These masters sought with great\\nefforts to do the impossible in art by means of labour, particularly\\nin foreshortenings and in things unpleasant to the eye, which were\\nas painful to see as they were difficult for them to execute. And\\nalthough their works were for the most part well drawn and free from\\nerrors, yet there was wanting a certain resolute spirit which was\\nnever seen in them, and that sweet harmony of colouring which the\\nBolognese Francia and Pietro Perugino first began to show in their\\nworks; at the sight of which people ran like madmen to this new and\\nmore lifelike beauty, for it seemed to them quite certain that\\nnothing better could ever be done. But their error was afterwards\\nclearly proved by the works of Leonardo da Vinci, who, giving a\\nbeginning to that third manner which we propose to call the\\nmodern--besides the force and boldness of his drawing, and the\\nextreme subtlety wherewith he counterfeited all the minutenesses of\\nnature exactly as they are--with good rule, better order, right\\nproportion, perfect drawing, and divine grace, abounding in\\nresources and having a most profound knowledge of art, may be truly\\nsaid to have endowed his figures with motion and breath.\\nThere followed after him, although at some distance, Giorgione da\\nCastelfranco, who obtained a beautiful gradation of colour in his\\npictures, and gave a sublime movement to his works by means of a\\ncertain darkness of shadow, very well conceived; and not inferior to\\nhim in giving force, relief, sweetness, and grace to his pictures,\\nwith his colouring, was Fra Bartolommeo di San Marco. But more than\\nall did the most gracious Raffaello da Urbino, who, studying the\\nlabours of the old masters and those of the modern, took the best\\nfrom them, and, having gathered it together, enriched the art of\\npainting with that complete perfection which was shown in ancient\\ntimes by the figures of Apelles and Zeuxis; nay, even more, if we\\nmay make bold to say it, as might be proved if we could compare\\ntheir works with his. Wherefore nature was left vanquished by his\\ncolours; and his invention was facile and peculiar to himself, as\\nmay be perceived by all who see his painted stories, which are as\\nvivid as writings, for in them he showed us places and buildings\\ntrue to reality, and the features and costumes both of our own\\npeople and of strangers, according to his pleasure; not to mention\\nhis gift of imparting grace to the heads of young men, old men, and\\nwomen, reserving modesty for the modest, wantonness for the wanton,\\nand for children now mischief in their eyes, now playfulness in\\ntheir attitudes; and the folds of his draperies, also, are neither\\ntoo simple nor too intricate, but of such a kind that they appear\\nreal.\\nIn the same manner, but sweeter in colouring and not so bold, there\\nfollowed Andrea del Sarto, who may be called a rare painter, for his\\nworks are free from errors. Nor is it possible to describe the\\ncharming vivacity seen in the works of Antonio da Correggio, who\\npainted hair in detail, not in the precise manner used by the\\nmasters before him, which was constrained, sharp, and dry, but soft\\nand feathery, with each single hair visible, such was his facility\\nin making them; and they seemed like gold and more beautiful than\\nreal hair, which is surpassed by that which he painted.\\nThe same did Francesco Mazzuoli of Parma, who excelled him in many\\nrespects in grace, adornment, and beauty of manner, as may be seen\\nin many of his pictures, which smile on whoever beholds them; and\\neven as there is a perfect illusion of sight in the eyes, so there\\nis perceived the beating of the pulse, according as it best pleased\\nhis brush. But whosoever shall consider the mural paintings of\\nPolidoro and Maturino, will see figures in attitudes that seem\\nbeyond the bounds of possibility, and he will wonder with amazement\\nhow it can be possible, not to describe with the tongue, which is\\neasy, but to express with the brush the tremendous conceptions which\\nthey put into execution with such mastery and dexterity, in\\nrepresenting the deeds of the Romans exactly as they were.\\nAnd how many there are who, having given life to their figures with\\ntheir colours, are now dead, such as Il Rosso, Fra Sebastiano,\\nGiulio Romano, and Perino del Vaga! For of the living, who are known\\nto all through their own efforts, there is no need to speak here.\\nBut what most concerns the whole world of art is that they have now\\nbrought it to such perfection, and made it so easy for him who\\npossesses draughtsmanship, invention, and colouring, that, whereas\\nthose early masters took six years to paint one panel, our modern\\nmasters can paint six in one year, as I can testify with the\\ngreatest confidence both from seeing and from doing; and our\\npictures are clearly much more highly finished and perfect than\\nthose executed in former times by masters of account.\\nBut he who bears the palm from both the living and the dead,\\ntranscending and eclipsing all others, is the divine Michelagnolo\\nBuonarroti, who holds the sovereignty not merely of one of these\\narts, but of all three together. This master surpasses and excels\\nnot only all those moderns who have almost vanquished nature, but\\neven those most famous ancients who without a doubt did so\\ngloriously surpass her; and in his own self he triumphs over\\nmoderns, ancients, and nature, who could scarcely conceive anything\\nso strange and so difficult that he would not be able, by the force\\nof his most divine intellect and by means of his industry,\\ndraughtsmanship, art, judgment, and grace, to excel it by a great\\nmeasure; and that not only in painting and in the use of colour,\\nunder which title are comprised all forms, and all bodies upright or\\nnot upright, palpable or impalpable, visible or invisible, but also\\nin the highest perfection of bodies in the round, with the point of\\nhis chisel. And from a plant so beautiful and so fruitful, through\\nhis labours, there have already spread branches so many and so\\nnoble, that, besides having filled the world in such unwonted\\nprofusion with the most luscious fruits, they have also given the\\nfinal form to these three most noble arts. And so great and so\\nmarvellous is his perfection, that it may be safely and surely said\\nthat his statues are in all their parts much more beautiful than the\\nancient; for if we compare the heads, hands, arms, and feet shaped\\nby the one with those of the others, we see in his a greater depth\\nand solidity, a grace more completely graceful, and a much more\\nabsolute perfection, accomplished with a manner so facile in the\\novercoming of difficulties, that it is not possible ever to see\\nanything better. And the same may be believed of his pictures,\\nwhich; if we chanced to have some by the most famous Greeks and\\nRomans, so that we might compare them face to face, would prove to\\nbe as much higher in value and more noble as his sculptures are\\nclearly superior to all those of the ancients.\\nBut if we admire so greatly those most famous masters who, spurred\\nby such extraordinary rewards and by such good-fortune, gave life to\\ntheir works, how much more should we not celebrate and exalt to the\\nheavens those rare intellects who, not only without reward, but in\\nmiserable poverty, bring forth fruits so precious? We must believe\\nand declare, then, that if, in this our age, there were a due meed\\nof remuneration, there would be without a doubt works greater and\\nmuch better than were ever wrought by the ancients. But the fact\\nthat they have to grapple more with famine than with fame, keeps our\\nhapless intellects submerged, and, to the shame and disgrace of\\nthose who could raise them up but give no thought to it, prevents\\nthem from becoming known.\\nAnd let this be enough to have said on this subject; for it is now\\ntime to return to the Lives, and to treat in detail of all those who\\nhave executed famous works in this third manner, the creator of\\nwhich was Leonardo da Vinci, with whom we will now begin.', 'LEONARDO DA VINCI\\nPAINTER AND SCULPTOR OF FLORENCE\\nThe greatest gifts are often seen, in the course of nature, rained\\nby celestial influences on human creatures; and sometimes, in\\nsupernatural fashion, beauty, grace, and talent are united beyond\\nmeasure in one single person, in a manner that to whatever such an\\none turns his attention, his every action is so divine, that,\\nsurpassing all other men, it makes itself clearly known as a thing\\nbestowed by God (as it is), and not acquired by human art. This was\\nseen by all mankind in Leonardo da Vinci, in whom, besides a beauty\\nof body never sufficiently extolled, there was an infinite grace in\\nall his actions; and so great was his genius, and such its growth,\\nthat to whatever difficulties he turned his mind, he solved them\\nwith ease. In him was great bodily strength, joined to dexterity,\\nwith a spirit and courage ever royal and magnanimous; and the fame\\nof his name so increased, that not only in his lifetime was he held\\nin esteem, but his reputation became even greater among posterity\\nafter his death.\\nTruly marvellous and celestial was Leonardo, the son of Ser Piero da\\nVinci; and in learning and in the rudiments of letters he would have\\nmade great proficience, if he had not been so variable and unstable,\\nfor he set himself to learn many things, and then, after having\\nbegun them, abandoned them. Thus, in arithmetic, during the few\\nmonths that he studied it, he made so much progress, that, by\\ncontinually suggesting doubts and difficulties to the master who\\nwas teaching him, he would very often bewilder him. He gave some\\nlittle attention to music, and quickly resolved to learn to play the\\nlyre, as one who had by nature a spirit most lofty and full of\\nrefinement: wherefore he sang divinely to that instrument,\\nimprovising upon it. Nevertheless, although he occupied himself with\\nsuch a variety of things, he never ceased drawing and working in\\nrelief, pursuits which suited his fancy more than any other. Ser\\nPiero, having observed this, and having considered the loftiness of\\nhis intellect, one day took some of his drawings and carried them to\\nAndrea del Verrocchio, who was much his friend, and besought him\\nstraitly to tell him whether Leonardo, by devoting himself to\\ndrawing, would make any proficience. Andrea was astonished to see\\nthe extraordinary beginnings of Leonardo, and urged Ser Piero that\\nhe should make him study it; wherefore he arranged with Leonardo\\nthat he should enter the workshop of Andrea, which Leonardo did with\\nthe greatest willingness in the world. And he practised not one\\nbranch of art only, but all those in which drawing played a part;\\nand having an intellect so divine and marvellous that he was also an\\nexcellent geometrician, he not only worked in sculpture, making in\\nhis youth, in clay, some heads of women that are smiling, of which\\nplaster casts are still taken, and likewise some heads of boys which\\nappeared to have issued from the hand of a master; but in\\narchitecture, also, he made many drawings both of ground-plans and\\nof other designs of buildings; and he was the first, although but a\\nyouth, who suggested the plan of reducing the river Arno to a\\nnavigable canal from Pisa to Florence. He made designs of\\nflour-mills, fulling-mills, and engines, which might be driven by\\nthe force of water: and since he wished that his profession should\\nbe painting, he studied much in drawing after nature, and sometimes\\nin making models of figures in clay, over which he would lay soft\\npieces of cloth dipped in clay, and then set himself patiently to\\ndraw them on a certain kind of very fine Rheims cloth, or prepared\\nlinen: and he executed them in black and white with the point of his\\nbrush, so that it was a marvel, as some of them by his hand, which I\\nhave in our book of drawings, still bear witness; besides which, he\\ndrew on paper with such diligence and so well, that there is no one\\nwho has ever equalled him in perfection of finish; and I have one, a\\nhead drawn with the style in chiaroscuro, which is divine.\\nAnd there was infused in that brain such grace from God, and a power\\nof expression in such sublime accord with the intellect and memory\\nthat served it, and he knew so well how to express his conceptions\\nby draughtsmanship, that he vanquished with his discourse, and\\nconfuted with his reasoning, every valiant wit. And he was\\ncontinually making models and designs to show men how to remove\\nmountains with ease, and how to bore them in order to pass from one\\nlevel to another; and by means of levers, windlasses, and screws, he\\nshowed the way to raise and draw great weights, together with\\nmethods for emptying harbours, and pumps for removing water from low\\nplaces, things which his brain never ceased from devising; and of\\nthese ideas and labours many drawings may be seen, scattered abroad\\namong our craftsmen; and I myself have seen not a few. He even went\\nso far as to waste his time in drawing knots of cords, made\\naccording to an order, that from one end all the rest might follow\\ntill the other, so as to fill a round; and one of these is to be\\nseen in stamp, most difficult and beautiful, and in the middle of it\\nare these words, \"Leonardus Vinci Accademia.\" And among these models\\nand designs, there was one by which he often demonstrated to many\\ningenious citizens, who were then governing Florence, how he\\nproposed to raise the Temple of S. Giovanni in Florence, and place\\nsteps under it, without damaging the building; and with such strong\\nreasons did he urge this, that it appeared possible, although each\\nman, after he had departed, would recognize for himself the\\nimpossibility of so vast an undertaking.\\nHe was so pleasing in conversation, that he attracted to himself the\\nhearts of men. And although he possessed, one might say, nothing,\\nand worked little, he always kept servants and horses, in which\\nlatter he took much delight, and particularly in all other animals,\\nwhich he managed with the greatest love and patience; and this he\\nshowed when often passing by the places where birds were sold, for,\\ntaking them with his own hand out of their cages, and having paid to\\nthose who sold them the price that was asked, he let them fly away\\ninto the air, restoring to them their lost liberty. For which\\nreason nature was pleased so to favour him, that, wherever he turned\\nhis thought, brain, and mind, he displayed such divine power in his\\nworks, that, in giving them their perfection, no one was ever his\\npeer in readiness, vivacity, excellence, beauty, and grace.\\nIt is clear that Leonardo, through his comprehension of art, began\\nmany things and never finished one of them, since it seemed to him\\nthat the hand was not able to attain to the perfection of art in\\ncarrying out the things which he imagined; for the reason that he\\nconceived in idea difficulties so subtle and so marvellous, that\\nthey could never be expressed by the hands, be they ever so\\nexcellent. And so many were his caprices, that, philosophizing of\\nnatural things, he set himself to seek out the properties of herbs,\\ngoing on even to observe the motions of the heavens, the path of the\\nmoon, and the courses of the sun.\\nHe was placed, then, as has been said, in his boyhood, at the\\ninstance of Ser Piero, to learn art with Andrea del Verrocchio, who\\nwas making a panel-picture of S. John baptizing Christ, when\\nLeonardo painted an angel who was holding some garments; and\\nalthough he was but a lad, Leonardo executed it in such a manner\\nthat his angel was much better than the figures of Andrea; which was\\nthe reason that Andrea would never again touch colour, in disdain\\nthat a child should know more than he.\\nHe was commissioned to make a cartoon for a door-hanging that was to\\nbe executed in Flanders, woven in gold and silk, to be sent to the\\nKing of Portugal, of Adam and Eve sinning in the Earthly Paradise;\\nwherein Leonardo drew with the brush in chiaroscuro, with the lights\\nin lead-white, a meadow of infinite kinds of herbage, with some\\nanimals, of which, in truth, it may be said that for diligence and\\ntruth to nature divine wit could not make it so perfect. In it is\\nthe fig-tree, together with the foreshortening of the leaves and the\\nvarying aspects of the branches, wrought with such lovingness that\\nthe brain reels at the mere thought how a man could have such\\npatience. There is also a palm-tree which has the radiating crown of\\nthe palm, executed with such great and marvellous art that nothing\\nsave the patience and intellect of Leonardo could avail to do it.\\nThis work was carried no farther; wherefore the cartoon is now at\\nFlorence, in the blessed house of the Magnificent Ottaviano de\\'\\nMedici, presented to him not long ago by the uncle of Leonardo.\\nIt is said that Ser Piero da Vinci, being at his villa, was besought\\nas a favour, by a peasant of his, who had made a buckler with his\\nown hands out of a fig-tree that he had cut down on the farm, to\\nhave it painted for him in Florence, which he did very willingly,\\nsince the countryman was very skilful at catching birds and fishing,\\nand Ser Piero made much use of him in these pursuits. Thereupon,\\nhaving had it taken to Florence, without saying a word to Leonardo\\nas to whose it was, he asked him to paint something upon it.\\nLeonardo, having one day taken this buckler in his hands, and seeing\\nit twisted, badly made, and clumsy, straightened it by the fire,\\nand, having given it to a turner, from the rude and clumsy thing\\nthat it was, caused it to be made smooth and even. And afterwards,\\nhaving given it a coat of gesso, and having prepared it in his own\\nway, he began to think what he could paint upon it, that might be\\nable to terrify all who should come upon it, producing the same\\neffect as once did the head of Medusa. For this purpose, then,\\nLeonardo carried to a room of his own into which no one entered save\\nhimself alone, lizards great and small, crickets, serpents,\\nbutterflies, grasshoppers, bats, and other strange kinds of suchlike\\nanimals, out of the number of which, variously put together, he\\nformed a great ugly creature, most horrible and terrifying, which\\nemitted a poisonous breath and turned the air to flame; and he made\\nit coming out of a dark and jagged rock, belching forth venom from\\nits open throat, fire from its eyes, and smoke from its nostrils, in\\nso strange a fashion that it appeared altogether a monstrous and\\nhorrible thing; and so long did he labour over making it, that the\\nstench of the dead animals in that room was past bearing, but\\nLeonardo did not notice it, so great was the love that he bore\\ntowards art. The work being finished, although it was no longer\\nasked for either by the countryman or by his father, Leonardo told\\nthe latter that he might send for the buckler at his convenience,\\nsince, for his part, it was finished. Ser Piero having therefore\\ngone one morning to the room for the buckler, and having knocked at\\nthe door, Leonardo opened to him, telling him to wait a little; and,\\nhaving gone back into the room, he adjusted the buckler in a good\\nlight on the easel, and put to the window, in order to make a soft\\nlight, and then he bade him come in to see it. Ser Piero, at the\\nfirst glance, taken by surprise, gave a sudden start, not thinking\\nthat that was the buckler, nor merely painted the form that he saw\\nupon it, and, falling back a step, Leonardo checked him, saying,\\n\"This work serves the end for which it was made; take it, then, and\\ncarry it away, since this is the effect that it was meant to\\nproduce.\" This thing appeared to Ser Piero nothing short of a\\nmiracle, and he praised very greatly the ingenious idea of Leonardo;\\nand then, having privately bought from a pedlar another buckler,\\npainted with a heart transfixed by an arrow, he presented it to the\\ncountryman, who remained obliged to him for it as long as he lived.\\nAfterwards, Ser Piero sold the buckler of Leonardo secretly to some\\nmerchants in Florence, for a hundred ducats; and in a short time it\\ncame into the hands of the Duke of Milan, having been sold to him by\\nthe said merchants for three hundred ducats.\\nLeonardo then made a picture of Our Lady, a most excellent work,\\nwhich was in the possession of Pope Clement VII; and, among other\\nthings painted therein, he counterfeited a glass vase full of water,\\ncontaining some flowers, in which, besides its marvellous\\nnaturalness, he had imitated the dew-drops on the flowers, so that\\nit seemed more real than the reality. For Antonio Segni, who was\\nvery much his friend, he made, on a sheet of paper, a Neptune\\nexecuted with such careful draughtsmanship that it seemed absolutely\\nalive. In it one saw the ocean troubled, and Neptune\\'s car drawn by\\nsea-horses, with fantastic creatures, marine monsters and winds, and\\nsome very beautiful heads of sea-gods. This drawing was presented by\\nFabio, the son of Antonio, to Messer Giovanni Gaddi, with this\\nepigram:\\n  Pinxit Virgilius Neptunum, pinxit Homerus,\\n    Dum maris undisoni per vada flectit equos.\\n  Mente quidem vates illum conspexit uterque,\\n    Vincius ast oculis; jureque vincit eos.\\nThe fancy came to him to paint a picture in oils of the head of a\\nMedusa, with the head attired with a coil of snakes, the most\\nstrange and extravagant invention that could ever be imagined;\\nbut since it was a work that took time, it remained unfinished, as\\nhappened with almost all his things. It is among the rare works of\\nart in the Palace of Duke Cosimo, together with the head of an\\nangel, who is raising one arm in the air, which, coming forward, is\\nforeshortened from the shoulder to the elbow, and with the other he\\nraises the hand to the breast.\\nIt is an extraordinary thing how that genius, in his desire to give\\nthe highest relief to the works that he made, went so far with dark\\nshadows, in order to find the darkest possible grounds, that he\\nsought for blacks which might make deeper shadows and be darker than\\nother blacks, that by their means he might make his lights the\\nbrighter; and in the end this method turned out so dark, that, no\\nlight remaining there, his pictures had rather the character of\\nthings made to represent an effect of night, than the clear quality\\nof daylight; which all came from seeking to give greater relief, and\\nto achieve the final perfection of art.\\nHe was so delighted when he saw certain bizarre heads of men, with\\nthe beard or hair growing naturally, that he would follow one that\\npleased him a whole day, and so treasured him up in idea, that\\nafterwards, on arriving home, he drew him as if he had had him in\\nhis presence. Of this sort there are many heads to be seen, both of\\nwomen and of men, and I have several of them, drawn by his hand with\\nthe pen, in our book of drawings, which I have mentioned so many\\ntimes; such was that of Amerigo Vespucci, which is a very beautiful\\nhead of an old man drawn with charcoal, and likewise that of\\nScaramuccia, Captain of the Gypsies, which afterwards came into the\\nhands of M. Donato Valdambrini of Arezzo, Canon of S. Lorenzo, left\\nto him by Giambullari.\\nHe began a panel-picture of the Adoration of the Magi, containing\\nmany beautiful things, particularly the heads, which was in the\\nhouse of Amerigo Benci, opposite the Loggia de\\' Peruzzi; and this,\\nalso, remained unfinished, like his other works.\\nIt came to pass that Giovan Galeazzo, Duke of Milan, being dead, and\\nLodovico Sforza raised to the same rank, in the year 1494, Leonardo\\nwas summoned to Milan in great repute to the Duke, who took much\\ndelight in the sound of the lyre, to the end that he might play it:\\nand Leonardo took with him that instrument which he had made with\\nhis own hands, in great part of silver, in the form of a horse\\'s\\nskull--a thing bizarre and new--in order that the harmony might be\\nof greater volume and more sonorous in tone; with which he surpassed\\nall the musicians who had come together there to play. Besides this,\\nhe was the best improviser in verse of his day. The Duke, hearing\\nthe marvellous discourse of Leonardo, became so enamoured of his\\ngenius, that it was something incredible: and he prevailed upon him\\nby entreaties to paint an altar-panel containing a Nativity, which\\nwas sent by the Duke to the Emperor.\\nHe also painted in Milan, for the Friars of S. Dominic, at S. Maria\\ndelle Grazie, a Last Supper, a most beautiful and marvellous thing;\\nand to the heads of the Apostles he gave such majesty and beauty,\\nthat he left the head of Christ unfinished, not believing that he\\nwas able to give it that divine air which is essential to the image\\nof Christ. This work, remaining thus all but finished, has ever been\\nheld by the Milanese in the greatest veneration, and also by\\nstrangers as well; for Leonardo imagined and succeeded in expressing\\nthat anxiety which had seized the Apostles in wishing to know who\\nshould betray their Master. For which reason in all their faces are\\nseen love, fear, and wrath, or rather, sorrow, at not being able to\\nunderstand the meaning of Christ; which thing excites no less marvel\\nthan the sight, in contrast to it, of obstinacy, hatred, and\\ntreachery in Judas; not to mention that every least part of the work\\ndisplays an incredible diligence, seeing that even in the tablecloth\\nthe texture of the stuff is counterfeited in such a manner that\\nlinen itself could not seem more real.\\nIt is said that the Prior of that place kept pressing Leonardo, in a\\nmost importunate manner, to finish the work; for it seemed strange\\nto him to see Leonardo sometimes stand half a day at a time, lost in\\ncontemplation, and he would have liked him to go on like the\\nlabourers hoeing in his garden, without ever stopping his brush. And\\nnot content with this, he complained of it to the Duke, and that so\\nwarmly, that he was constrained to send for Leonardo and delicately\\nurged him to work, contriving nevertheless to show him that he was\\ndoing all this because of the importunity of the Prior. Leonardo,\\nknowing that the intellect of that Prince was acute and discerning,\\nwas pleased to discourse at large with the Duke on the subject, a\\nthing which he had never done with the Prior: and he reasoned much\\nwith him about art, and made him understand that men of lofty genius\\nsometimes accomplish the most when they work the least, seeking out\\ninventions with the mind, and forming those perfect ideas which the\\nhands afterwards express and reproduce from the images already\\nconceived in the brain. And he added that two heads were still\\nwanting for him to paint; that of Christ, which he did not wish to\\nseek on earth; and he could not think that it was possible to\\nconceive in the imagination that beauty and heavenly grace which\\nshould be the mark of God incarnate. Next, there was wanting that of\\nJudas, which was also troubling him, not thinking himself capable of\\nimagining features that should represent the countenance of him who,\\nafter so many benefits received, had a mind so cruel as to resolve\\nto betray his Lord, the Creator of the world. However, he would seek\\nout a model for the latter; but if in the end he could not find a\\nbetter, he should not want that of the importunate and tactless\\nPrior. This thing moved the Duke wondrously to laughter, and he said\\nthat Leonardo had a thousand reasons on his side. And so the poor\\nPrior, in confusion, confined himself to urging on the work in the\\ngarden, and left Leonardo in peace, who finished only the head of\\nJudas, which seems the very embodiment of treachery and inhumanity;\\nbut that of Christ, as has been said, remained unfinished. The\\nnobility of this picture, both because of its design, and from its\\nhaving been wrought with an incomparable diligence, awoke a desire\\nin the King of France to transport it into his kingdom; wherefore he\\ntried by all possible means to discover whether there were\\narchitects who, with cross-stays of wood and iron, might have been\\nable to make it so secure that it might be transported safely;\\nwithout considering any expense that might have been involved\\nthereby, so much did he desire it. But the fact of its being painted\\non the wall robbed his Majesty of his desire; and the picture\\nremained with the Milanese. In the same refectory, while he was\\nworking at the Last Supper, on the end wall where is a Passion in\\nthe old manner, Leonardo portrayed the said Lodovico, with\\nMassimiliano, his eldest son; and, on the other side, the Duchess\\nBeatrice, with Francesco, their other son, both of whom afterwards\\nbecame Dukes of Milan; and all are portrayed divinely well.\\nWhile he was engaged on this work, he proposed to the Duke to make a\\nhorse in bronze, of a marvellous greatness, in order to place upon\\nit, as a memorial, the image of the Duke. And on so vast a scale did\\nhe begin it and continue it, that it could never be completed. And\\nthere are those who have been of the opinion (so various and so\\noften malign out of envy are the judgments of men) that he began it\\nwith no intention of finishing it, because, being of so great a\\nsize, an incredible difficulty was encountered in seeking to cast it\\nin one piece; and it might also be believed that, from the result,\\nmany may have formed such a judgment, since many of his works have\\nremained unfinished. But, in truth, one can believe that his vast\\nand most excellent mind was hampered through being too full of\\ndesire, and that his wish ever to seek out excellence upon\\nexcellence, and perfection upon perfection, was the reason of it.\\n\"Tal che l\\' opera fosse ritardata dal desio,\" as our Petrarca has\\nsaid. And, indeed, those who saw the great model that Leonardo made\\nin clay vow that they have never seen a more beautiful thing, or a\\nmore superb; and it was preserved until the French came to Milan\\nwith King Louis of France, and broke it all to pieces. Lost, also,\\nis a little model of it in wax, which was held to be perfect,\\ntogether with a book on the anatomy of the horse made by him by way\\nof study.\\nHe then applied himself, but with greater care, to the anatomy of\\nman, assisted by and in turn assisting, in this research, Messer\\nMarc\\' Antonio della Torre, an excellent philosopher, who was then\\nlecturing at Pavia, and who wrote of this matter; and he was one of\\nthe first (as I have heard tell) that began to illustrate the\\nproblems of medicine with the doctrine of Galen, and to throw true\\nlight on anatomy, which up to that time had been wrapped in the\\nthick and gross darkness of ignorance. And in this he found\\nmarvellous aid in the brain, work, and hand of Leonardo, who made a\\nbook drawn in red chalk, and annotated with the pen, of the bodies\\nthat he dissected with his own hand, and drew with the greatest\\ndiligence; wherein he showed all the frame of the bones; and then\\nadded to them, in order, all the nerves, and covered them with\\nmuscles; the first attached to the bone, the second that hold the\\nbody firm, and the third that move it; and beside them, part by\\npart, he wrote in letters of an ill-shaped character, which he made\\nwith the left hand, backwards; and whoever is not practised in\\nreading them cannot understand them, since they are not to be read\\nsave with a mirror. Of these papers on the anatomy of man, a great\\npart is in the hands of Messer Francesco da Melzo, a gentleman of\\nMilan, who in the time of Leonardo was a very beautiful boy, and\\nmuch beloved by him, and now is a no less beautiful and gentle old\\nman; and he holds them dear, and keeps such papers together as if\\nthey were relics, in company with the portrait of Leonardo of happy\\nmemory; and to all who read these writings, it seems impossible that\\nthat divine spirit should have discoursed so well of art, and of the\\nmuscles, nerves, and veins, and with such diligence of everything.\\nSo, also, there are in the hands of ----, a painter of Milan,\\ncertain writings of Leonardo, likewise in characters written with\\nthe left hand, backwards, which treat of painting, and of the\\nmethods of drawing and colouring. This man, not long ago, came to\\nFlorence to see me, wishing to print this work, and he took it to\\nRome, in order to put it into effect; but I do not know what may\\nafterwards have become of it.\\nAnd to return to the works of Leonardo; there came to Milan, in his\\ntime, the King of France, wherefore Leonardo being asked to devise\\nsome bizarre thing, made a lion which walked several steps and then\\nopened its breast, and showed it full of lilies.\\nIn Milan he took for his assistant the Milanese Salai, who was most\\ncomely in grace and beauty, having fine locks, curling in ringlets,\\nin which Leonardo greatly delighted; and he taught him many things\\nof art; and certain works in Milan, which are said to be by Salai,\\nwere retouched by Leonardo.\\nHe returned to Florence, where he found that the Servite Friars had\\nentrusted to Filippino the painting of the panel for the high-altar\\nof the Nunziata; whereupon Leonardo said that he would willingly\\nhave done such a work. Filippino, having heard this, like the\\namiable fellow that he was, retired from the undertaking; and the\\nfriars, to the end that Leonardo might paint it, took him into their\\nhouse, meeting the expenses both of himself and of all his\\nhousehold; and thus he kept them in expectation for a long time, but\\nnever began anything. In the end, he made a cartoon containing a\\nMadonna and a S. Anne, with a Christ, which not only caused all the\\ncraftsmen to marvel, but, when it was finished, men and women, young\\nand old, continued for two days to flock for a sight of it to the\\nroom where it was, as if to a solemn festival, in order to gaze at\\nthe marvels of Leonardo, which caused all those people to be amazed;\\nfor in the face of that Madonna was seen whatever of the simple and\\nthe beautiful can by simplicity and beauty confer grace on a picture\\nof the Mother of Christ, since he wished to show that modesty and\\nthat humility which are looked for in an image of the Virgin,\\nsupremely content with gladness at seeing the beauty of her Son,\\nwhom she was holding with tenderness in her lap, while with most\\nchastened gaze she was looking down at S. John, as a little boy, who\\nwas playing with a lamb; not without a smile from S. Anne, who,\\noverflowing with joy, was beholding her earthly progeny become\\ndivine--ideas truly worthy of the brain and genius of Leonardo. This\\ncartoon, as will be told below, afterwards went to France. He made a\\nportrait of Ginevra d\\' Amerigo Benci, a very beautiful work; and\\nabandoned the work for the friars, who restored it to Filippino; but\\nhe, also, failed to finish it, having been overtaken by death.\\nLeonardo undertook to execute, for Francesco del Giocondo, the\\nportrait of Monna Lisa, his wife; and after toiling over it for four\\nyears, he left it unfinished; and the work is now in the collection\\nof King Francis of France, at Fontainebleau. In this head, whoever\\nwished to see how closely art could imitate nature, was able to\\ncomprehend it with ease; for in it were counterfeited all the\\nminutenesses that with subtlety are able to be painted, seeing that\\nthe eyes had that lustre and watery sheen which are always seen in\\nlife, and around them were all those rosy and pearly tints, as well\\nas the lashes, which cannot be represented without the greatest\\nsubtlety. The eyebrows, through his having shown the manner in\\nwhich the hairs spring from the flesh, here more close and here more\\nscanty, and curve according to the pores of the skin, could not be\\nmore natural. The nose, with its beautiful nostrils, rosy and\\ntender, appeared to be alive. The mouth, with its opening, and with\\nits ends united by the red of the lips to the flesh-tints of the\\nface, seemed, in truth, to be not colours but flesh. In the pit of\\nthe throat, if one gazed upon it intently, could be seen the beating\\nof the pulse. And, indeed, it may be said that it was painted in\\nsuch a manner as to make every valiant craftsman, be he who he may,\\ntremble and lose heart. He made use, also, of this device: Monna\\nLisa being very beautiful, he always employed, while he was painting\\nher portrait, persons to play or sing, and jesters, who might make\\nher remain merry, in order to take away that melancholy which\\npainters are often wont to give to the portraits that they paint.\\nAnd in this work of Leonardo\\'s there was a smile so pleasing, that\\nit was a thing more divine than human to behold; and it was held to\\nbe something marvellous, since the reality was not more alive.\\nBy reason, then, of the excellence of the works of this most divine\\ncraftsman, his fame had so increased that all persons who took\\ndelight in art--nay, the whole city of Florence--desired that he\\nshould leave them some memorial, and it was being proposed\\neverywhere that he should be commissioned to execute some great and\\nnotable work, whereby the commonwealth might be honoured and adorned\\nby the great genius, grace and judgment that were seen in the works\\nof Leonardo. And it was decided between the Gonfalonier and the\\nchief citizens, the Great Council Chamber having been newly\\nbuilt--the architecture of which had been contrived with the\\njudgment and counsel of Giuliano da San Gallo, Simone Pollaiuolo,\\ncalled Il Cronaca, Michelagnolo Buonarroti, and Baccio d\\' Agnolo, as\\nwill be related with more detail in the proper places--and having\\nbeen finished in great haste, it was ordained by public decree that\\nLeonardo should be given some beautiful work to paint; and so the\\nsaid hall was allotted to him by Piero Soderini, then Gonfalonier of\\nJustice. Whereupon Leonardo, determining to execute this work, began\\na cartoon in the Sala del Papa, an apartment in S. Maria Novella,\\nrepresenting the story of Niccolò Piccinino, Captain of Duke\\nFilippo of Milan; wherein he designed a group of horsemen who were\\nfighting for a standard, a work that was held to be very excellent\\nand of great mastery, by reason of the marvellous ideas that he had\\nin composing that battle; seeing that in it rage, fury, and revenge\\nare perceived as much in the men as in the horses, among which two\\nwith the fore-legs interlocked are fighting no less fiercely with\\ntheir teeth than those who are riding them do in fighting for that\\nstandard, which has been grasped by a soldier, who seeks by the\\nstrength of his shoulders, as he spurs his horse to flight, having\\nturned his body backwards and seized the staff of the standard, to\\nwrest it by force from the hands of four others, of whom two are\\ndefending it, each with one hand, and, raising their swords in the\\nother, are trying to sever the staff; while an old soldier in a red\\ncap, crying out, grips the staff with one hand, and, raising a\\nscimitar with the other, furiously aims a blow in order to cut off\\nboth the hands of those who, gnashing their teeth in the struggle,\\nare striving in attitudes of the utmost fierceness to defend their\\nbanner; besides which, on the ground, between the legs of the\\nhorses, there are two figures in foreshortening that are fighting\\ntogether, and the one on the ground has over him a soldier who has\\nraised his arm as high as possible, that thus with greater force he\\nmay plunge a dagger into his throat, in order to end his life; while\\nthe other, struggling with his legs and arms, is doing what he can\\nto escape death.\\nIt is not possible to describe the invention that Leonardo showed in\\nthe garments of the soldiers, all varied by him in different ways,\\nand likewise in the helmet-crests and other ornaments; not to\\nmention the incredible mastery that he displayed in the forms and\\nlineaments of the horses, which Leonardo, with their fiery spirit,\\nmuscles, and shapely beauty, drew better than any other master. It\\nis said that, in order to draw that cartoon, he made a most\\ningenious stage, which was raised by contracting it and lowered by\\nexpanding. And conceiving the wish to colour on the wall in oils, he\\nmade a composition of so gross an admixture, to act as a binder on\\nthe wall, that, going on to paint in the said hall, it began to peel\\noff in such a manner that in a short time he abandoned it, seeing it\\nspoiling.\\nLeonardo had very great spirit, and in his every action was most\\ngenerous. It is said that, going to the bank for the allowance that\\nhe used to draw every month from Piero Soderini, the cashier wanted\\nto give him certain paper-packets of pence; but he would not take\\nthem, saying in answer, \"I am no penny-painter.\" Having been blamed\\nfor cheating Piero Soderini, there began to be murmurings against\\nhim; wherefore Leonardo so wrought upon his friends, that he got the\\nmoney together and took it to Piero to repay him; but he would not\\naccept it.\\nHe went to Rome with Duke Giuliano de\\' Medici, at the election of\\nPope Leo, who spent much of his time on philosophical studies, and\\nparticularly on alchemy; where, forming a paste of a certain kind of\\nwax, as he walked he shaped animals very thin and full of wind, and,\\nby blowing into them, made them fly through the air, but when the\\nwind ceased they fell to the ground. On the back of a most bizarre\\nlizard, found by the vine-dresser of the Belvedere, he fixed, with a\\nmixture of quicksilver, wings composed of scales stripped from other\\nlizards, which, as it walked, quivered with the motion; and having\\ngiven it eyes, horns, and beard, taming it, and keeping it in a box,\\nhe made all his friends, to whom he showed it, fly for fear. He used\\noften to have the guts of a wether completely freed of their fat and\\ncleaned, and thus made so fine that they could have been held in the\\npalm of the hand; and having placed a pair of blacksmith\\'s bellows\\nin another room, he fixed to them one end of these, and, blowing\\ninto them, filled the room, which was very large, so that whoever\\nwas in it was obliged to retreat into a corner; showing how,\\ntransparent and full of wind, from taking up little space at the\\nbeginning they had come to occupy much, and likening them to virtue.\\nHe made an infinite number of such follies, and gave his attention\\nto mirrors; and he tried the strangest methods in seeking out oils\\nfor painting, and varnish for preserving works when painted.\\nHe made at this time, for Messer Baldassarre Turini da Pescia, who\\nwas Datary to Pope Leo, a little picture of the Madonna with the\\nChild in her arms, with infinite diligence and art; but whether\\nthrough the fault of whoever primed the panel with gesso, or because\\nof his innumerable and capricious mixtures of grounds and colours,\\nit is now much spoilt. And in another small picture he made a\\nportrait of a little boy, which is beautiful and graceful to a\\nmarvel; and both of them are now at Pescia, in the hands of Messer\\nGiuliano Turini. It is related that, a work having been allotted to\\nhim by the Pope, he straightway began to distil oils and herbs, in\\norder to make the varnish; at which Pope Leo said: \"Alas! this man\\nwill never do anything, for he begins by thinking of the end of the\\nwork, before the beginning.\"\\nThere was very great disdain between Michelagnolo Buonarroti and\\nhim, on account of which Michelagnolo departed from Florence, with\\nthe excuse of Duke Giuliano, having been summoned by the Pope to the\\ncompetition for the façade of S. Lorenzo. Leonardo, understanding\\nthis, departed and went into France, where the King, having had\\nworks by his hand, bore him great affection; and he desired that he\\nshould colour the cartoon of S. Anne, but Leonardo, according to his\\ncustom, put him off for a long time with words.\\nFinally, having grown old, he remained ill many months, and, feeling\\nhimself near to death, asked to have himself diligently informed of\\nthe teaching of the Catholic faith, and of the good way and holy\\nChristian religion; and then, with many moans, he confessed and was\\npenitent; and although he could not raise himself well on his feet,\\nsupporting himself on the arms of his friends and servants, he was\\npleased to take devoutly the most holy Sacrament, out of his bed.\\nThe King, who was wont often and lovingly to visit him, then came\\ninto the room; wherefore he, out of reverence, having raised himself\\nto sit upon the bed, giving him an account of his sickness and the\\ncircumstances of it, showed withal how much he had offended God and\\nmankind in not having worked at his art as he should have done.\\nThereupon he was seized by a paroxysm, the messenger of death; for\\nwhich reason the King having risen and having taken his head, in\\norder to assist him and show him favour, to the end that he might\\nalleviate his pain, his spirit, which was divine, knowing that it\\ncould not have any greater honour, expired in the arms of the King,\\nin the seventy-fifth year of his age.\\nThe loss of Leonardo grieved beyond measure all those who had known\\nhim, since there was never any one who did so much honour to\\npainting. With the splendour of his aspect, which was very\\nbeautiful, he made serene every broken spirit: and with his\\nwords he turned to yea, or nay, every obdurate intention. By his\\nphysical force he could restrain any outburst of rage: and with his\\nright hand he twisted the iron ring of a door-bell, or a horse-shoe,\\nas if it were lead. With his liberality he would assemble together\\nand support his every friend, poor or rich, if only he had intellect\\nand worth. He adorned and honoured, in every action, no matter what\\nmean and bare dwelling; wherefore, in truth, Florence received a\\nvery great gift in the birth of Leonardo, and an incalculable loss\\nin his death. In the art of painting, he added to the manner of\\ncolouring in oils a certain obscurity, whereby the moderns have\\ngiven great force and relief to their figures. And in statuary, he\\nproved his worth in the three figures of bronze that are over the\\ndoor of S. Giovanni, on the side towards the north, executed by\\nGiovan Francesco Rustici, but contrived with the advice of Leonardo;\\nwhich are the most beautiful pieces of casting, the best designed,\\nand the most perfect that have as yet been seen in modern days. By\\nLeonardo we have the anatomy of the horse, and that of man even more\\ncomplete. And so, on account of all his qualities, so many and so\\ndivine, although he worked much more by words than by deeds, his\\nname and fame can never be extinguished; wherefore it was thus said\\nin his praise by Messer Giovan Battista Strozzi:\\n  Vince costui pur solo\\n  Tutti altri; e vince Fidia e vince Apelle\\n  E tutto il lor vittorioso stuolo.\\nA disciple of Leonardo was Giovan Antonio Boltraffio of Milan, a\\nperson of great skill and understanding, who, in the year 1500,\\npainted with much diligence, for the Church of the Misericordia,\\nwithout Bologna, a panel in oils containing Our Lady with the Child\\nin her arms, S. John the Baptist, S. Sebastian naked, and the patron\\nwho caused it to be executed, portrayed from the life, on his\\nknees--a truly beautiful work, on which he wrote his name, calling\\nhimself a disciple of Leonardo. He has made other works, both at\\nMilan and elsewhere; but it must be enough here to have named this,\\nwhich is the best. Another (of his disciples) was Marco Oggioni, who\\npainted, in S. Maria della Pace, the Passing of Our Lady and the\\nMarriage of Cana in Galilee.', \"GIORGIONE DA CASTELFRANCO\\nPAINTER OF VENICE\\nAt the same time when Florence was acquiring such fame by reason of\\nthe works of Leonardo, no little adornment was conferred on Venice\\nby the talent and excellence of one of her citizens, who surpassed\\nby a great measure not only the Bellini, whom the Venetians held in\\nsuch esteem, but also every other master who had painted up to that\\ntime in that city. This was Giorgio, who was born at Castelfranco in\\nthe territory of Treviso, in the year 1478, when the Doge was\\nGiovanni Mozzenigo, brother of Doge Piero. In time, from the nature\\nof his person and from the greatness of his mind, Giorgio came to be\\ncalled Giorgione; and although he was born from very humble stock,\\nnevertheless he was not otherwise than gentle and of good breeding\\nthroughout his whole life. He was brought up in Venice, and took\\nunceasing delight in the joys of love; and the sound of the lute\\ngave him marvellous pleasure, so that in his day he played and sang\\nso divinely that he was often employed for that purpose at various\\nmusical assemblies and gatherings of noble persons. He studied\\ndrawing, and found it greatly to his taste; and in this nature\\nfavoured him so highly, that he, having become enamoured of her\\nbeauties, would never represent anything in his works without\\ncopying it from life; and so much was he her slave, imitating her\\ncontinuously, that he acquired the name not only of having surpassed\\nGiovanni and Gentile Bellini, but also of being the rival of the\\nmasters who were working in Tuscany and who were the creators of the\\nmodern manner. Giorgione had seen some things by the hand of\\nLeonardo with a beautiful gradation of colours, and with\\nextraordinary relief, effected, as has been related, by means of\\ndark shadows; and this manner pleased him so much that he was for\\never studying it as long as he lived, and in oil-painting he\\nimitated it greatly. Taking pleasure in the delights of good work,\\nhe was ever selecting, for putting into his pictures, the greatest\\nbeauty and the greatest variety that he could find. And nature gave\\nhim a spirit so benign, and with this, both in oil-painting and in\\nfresco, he made certain living forms and other things so soft, so\\nwell harmonized, and so well blended in the shadows, that many of\\nthe excellent masters of his time were forced to confess that he had\\nbeen born to infuse spirit into figures and to counterfeit the\\nfreshness of living flesh better than any other painter, not only in\\nVenice, but throughout the whole world.\\nIn his youth he executed in Venice many pictures of Our Lady and\\nother portraits from nature, which are very lifelike and beautiful;\\nof which we still have proof in three most beautiful heads in oils\\nby his hand, which are in the study of the Very Reverend Grimani,\\nPatriarch of Aquileia. One represents David--and it is reported to\\nbe his own portrait--with long locks reaching to the shoulders, as\\nwas the custom of those times; it is so vivacious and so fresh in\\ncolouring that it seems to be living flesh, and there is armour on\\nthe breast, as there is on the arm with which he is holding the\\nsevered head of Goliath. The second is a much larger head, portrayed\\nfrom nature; one hand is holding the red cap of a commander, and\\nthere is a cape of fur, below which is one of the old-fashioned\\ndoublets. This is believed to represent some military leader. The\\nthird is that of a boy, as beautiful as could be, with fleecy hair.\\nThese works demonstrate the excellence of Giorgione, and no less the\\naffection which that great Patriarch has ever borne to his genius,\\nholding them very dear, and that rightly. In Florence, in the house\\nof the sons of Giovanni Borgherini, there is a portrait by his hand\\nof the said Giovanni, taken when he was a young man in Venice, and\\nin the same picture is the master who was teaching him; and there\\nare no two heads to be seen with better touches in the flesh-colours\\nor with more beautiful tints in the shadows. In the house of Anton\\nde' Nobili there is another head of a captain in armour, very lively\\nand spirited, which is said to be one of the captains whom Consalvo\\nFerrante took with him to Venice when he visited Doge Agostino\\nBarberigo; at which time, it is related, Giorgione made a\\nportrait of the great Consalvo in armour, which was a very rare\\nwork, insomuch that there was no more beautiful painting than this\\nto be seen, and Consalvo took it away with him. Giorgione made many\\nother portraits which are scattered throughout many parts of Italy;\\nall very beautiful, as may be believed from that of Leonardo\\nLoredano, painted by Giorgione when Leonardo was Doge, which I saw\\nexhibited on one Ascension day, when I seemed to see that most\\nillustrious Prince alive. There is also one at Faenza, in the house\\nof Giovanni da Castel Bolognese, an excellent engraver of cameos and\\ncrystals; which work, executed for his father-in-law, is truly\\ndivine, since there is such a harmony in the gradation of the\\ncolours that it appears to be rather in relief than painted.\\nGiorgione took much delight in painting in fresco, and one among\\nmany works that he executed was the whole of a façade of the Ca\\nSoranzo on the Piazza di S. Polo; wherein, besides many pictures and\\nscenes and other things of fancy, there may be seen a picture\\npainted in oils on the plaster, a work which has withstood rain,\\nsun, and wind, and has remained fresh up to our own day. There is\\nalso a Spring, which appears to me to be one of the most beautiful\\nworks that he painted in fresco, and it is a great pity that time\\nhas consumed it so cruelly. For my part, I know nothing that injures\\nworks in fresco more than the sirocco, and particularly near the\\nsea, where it always brings a salt moisture with it.\\nThere broke out at Venice, in the year 1504, in the Fondaco de'\\nTedeschi by the Ponte del Rialto, a most terrible fire, which\\nconsumed the whole building and all the merchandise, to the very\\ngreat loss of the merchants; wherefore the Signoria of Venice\\nordained that it should be rebuilt anew, and it was speedily\\nfinished with more accommodation in the way of living-rooms, and\\nwith greater magnificence, adornment, and beauty. Thereupon, the\\nfame of Giorgione having grown great, it was ordained after\\ndeliberation by those who had charge of the matter, that Giorgione\\nshould paint it in fresco with colours according to his own fancy,\\nprovided only that he gave proof of his genius and executed an\\nexcellent work, since it would be in the most beautiful place and\\nmost conspicuous site in the city. And so Giorgione put his hand to\\nthe work, but thought of nothing save of making figures according\\nto his own fancy, in order to display his art, so that, in truth,\\nthere are no scenes to be found there with any order, or\\nrepresenting the deeds of any distinguished person, either ancient\\nor modern; and I, for my part, have never understood them, nor have\\nI found, for all the inquiries that I have made, anyone who\\nunderstands them, for in one place there is a woman, in another a\\nman, in diverse attitudes, while one has the head of a lion near\\nhim, and another an angel in the guise of a Cupid, nor can one tell\\nwhat it may all mean. There is, indeed, over the principal door,\\nwhich opens into the Merceria, a woman seated who has at her feet\\nthe severed head of a giant, almost in the form of a Judith; she is\\nraising the head with her sword, and speaking with a German, who is\\nbelow her; but I have not been able to determine for what he\\nintended her to stand, unless, indeed, he may have meant her to\\nrepresent Germany. However, it may be seen that his figures are well\\ngrouped, and that he was ever making progress; and there are in it\\nheads and parts of figures very well painted, and most vivacious in\\ncolouring. In all that he did there he aimed at being faithful to\\nnature, without any imitation of another's manner; and the work is\\ncelebrated and famous in Venice, no less for what he painted therein\\nthan through its convenience for commerce and its utility to the\\ncommonwealth.\\nHe executed a picture of Christ bearing the Cross, with a Jew\\ndragging him along, which in time was placed in the Church of S.\\nRocco, and which now, through the veneration that many feel for it,\\nworks miracles, as all may see. He worked in various places, such as\\nCastelfranco, and throughout the territory of Treviso, and he made\\nmany portraits for Italian Princes; and many of his works were sent\\nout of Italy, as things truly worthy to bear testimony that if\\nTuscany had a superabundance of craftsmen in every age, the region\\nbeyond, near the mountains, was not always abandoned and forgotten\\nby Heaven.\\nIt is related that Giorgione, at the time when Andrea Verrocchio was\\nmaking his bronze horse, fell into an argument with certain\\nsculptors, who maintained, since sculpture showed various attitudes\\nand aspects in one single figure to one walking round it, that for\\nthis reason it surpassed painting, which only showed one side\\nof a figure. Giorgione was of the opinion that there could be shown\\nin a painted scene, without any necessity for walking round, at one\\nsingle glance, all the various aspects that a man can present in\\nmany gestures--a thing which sculpture cannot do without a change of\\nposition and point of view, so that in her case the points of view\\nare many, and not one. Moreover, he proposed to show in one single\\npainted figure the front, the back, and the profile on either side,\\na challenge which brought them to their senses; and he did it in the\\nfollowing way. He painted a naked man with his back turned, at whose\\nfeet was a most limpid pool of water, wherein he painted the\\nreflection of the man's front. At one side was a burnished cuirass\\nthat he had taken off, which showed his left profile, since\\neverything could be seen on the polished surface of the piece of\\narmour; and on the other side was a mirror, which reflected the\\nother profile of the naked figure; which was a thing of most\\nbeautiful and bizarre fancy, whereby he sought to prove that\\npainting does in fact, with more excellence, labour, and effect,\\nachieve more at one single view of a living figure than does\\nsculpture. And this work was greatly extolled and admired, as\\nsomething ingenious and beautiful.\\nHe also made a portrait from life of Caterina, Queen of Cyprus,\\nwhich I once saw in the hands of the illustrious Messer Giovanni\\nCornaro. There is in our book a head coloured in oils, the portrait\\nof a German of the Fugger family, who was at that time one of the\\nchief merchants in the Fondaco de' Tedeschi, which is an admirable\\nwork; together with other sketches and drawings made by him with the\\npen.\\nWhile Giorgione was employed in doing honour both to himself and to\\nhis country, and frequenting many houses in order to entertain his\\nvarious friends with his music, he became enamoured of a lady, and\\nthey took much joy, one with another, in their love. Now it happened\\nthat in the year 1511 she became infected with plague, without,\\nhowever, knowing anything about it; and Giorgione, visiting her as\\nusual, caught the plague in such a manner, that in a short time, at\\nthe age of thirty-four, he passed away to the other life, not\\nwithout infinite grief on the part of his many friends, who loved\\nhim for his virtues, and great hurt to the world, which thus lost\\nhim. However, they could bear up against this hurt and loss, in that\\nhe left behind him two excellent disciples in Sebastiano, the\\nVenetian, who afterwards became Friar of the Piombo at Rome, and\\nTiziano da Cadore, who not only equalled him, but surpassed him\\ngreatly; of both of whom we will speak at the proper time,\\ndescribing fully the honour and benefit that they have conferred on\\nart.\", \"ANTONIO DA CORREGGIO\\nPAINTER\\nI do not wish to leave that country wherein our great mother Nature,\\nin order not to be thought partial, gave to the world extraordinary\\nmen of that sort with which she had already for many and many a year\\nadorned Tuscany; among whom was one endowed with an excellent and\\nvery beautiful genius, by name Antonio da Correggio, a most rare\\npainter, who acquired the modern manner so perfectly, that in a few\\nyears, what with his natural gifts and his practice in art, he\\nbecame a most excellent and marvellous craftsman. He was very timid\\nby nature, and with great discomfort to himself he was continually\\nlabouring at the exercise of his art, for the sake of his family,\\nwhich weighed upon him; and although it was a natural goodness that\\nimpelled him, nevertheless he afflicted himself more than was right\\nin bearing the burden of those sufferings which are wont to crush\\nmankind. He was very melancholy in his practice of art, a slave to\\nher labours, and an unwearying investigator of all the difficulties\\nof her realm; to which witness is borne by a vast multitude of\\nfigures in the Duomo of Parma, executed in fresco and well finished,\\nwhich are to be found in the great tribune of the said church, and\\nare seen foreshortened from below with an effect of marvellous\\ngrandeur.\\nAntonio was the first who began to work in the modern manner in\\nLombardy; wherefore it is thought that if he, with his genius, had\\ngone forth from Lombardy and lived in Rome, he would have wrought\\nmiracles, and would have brought the sweat to the brow of many who\\nwere held to be great men in his time. For, his works being such as\\nthey are without his having seen any of the ancient or the best of\\nthe modern, it necessarily follows that, if he had seen them, he\\nwould have vastly improved his own, and, advancing from good to\\nbetter, would have reached the highest rank. It may, at least, be\\nheld for certain that no one ever handled colours better than he,\\nand that no craftsman ever painted with greater delicacy or with\\nmore relief, such was the softness of his flesh-painting, and such\\nthe grace with which he finished his works.\\nIn the same place, also, he painted two large pictures executed in\\noils, in one of which, among other figures, there may be seen a Dead\\nChrist, which was highly extolled. And in S. Giovanni, in the same\\ncity, he painted a tribune in fresco, wherein he represented Our\\nLady ascending into Heaven amidst a multitude of angels, with other\\nsaints around; as to which, it seems impossible that he should have\\nbeen able, I do not say to express it with his hand, but even to\\nconceive it in his imagination, so beautiful are the curves of the\\ndraperies and the expressions that he gave to those figures. Of\\nthese there are some drawings in our book, done in red chalk by his\\nhand, with some very beautiful borders of little boys, and other\\nborders drawn in that work by way of ornament, with various fanciful\\nscenes of sacrifices in the ancient manner. And in truth, if Antonio\\nhad not brought his works to that perfection which is seen in them,\\nhis drawings (although they show excellence of manner, and the charm\\nand practised touch of a master) would not have gained for him among\\ncraftsmen the name that he has won with his wonderful paintings.\\nThis art is so difficult, and has so many branches, that very often\\na craftsman is not able to practise them all to perfection; for\\nthere have been many who have drawn divinely well, but have shown\\nsome imperfection in colouring, and others have been marvellous in\\ncolouring, but have not drawn half so well. All this depends on\\nchoice, and on the practice bestowed, in youth, in one case on\\ndrawing, in another on colour. But since all is learnt in order to\\ncarry works to the height of perfection, which is to put good\\ncolouring, together with draughtsmanship, into everything that is\\nexecuted, for this reason Correggio deserves great praise, having\\nattained to the height of perfection in the works that he coloured\\neither in oils or in fresco; as he did in the Church of the Frati\\nde' Zoccoli di S. Francesco, in the same city, where he painted\\nan Annunciation in fresco so well, that, when it became necessary to\\npull it down in making some changes in that building, those friars\\ncaused the wall round it to be bound with timber strengthened with\\niron, and, cutting it away little by little, they saved it; and it\\nwas built by them into a more secure place in the same convent.\\nHe painted, also, over one of the gates of that city, a Madonna who\\nhas the Child in her arms; and it is an astounding thing to see the\\nlovely colouring of this work in fresco, through which he has won\\nfrom passing strangers, who have seen nothing else of his, infinite\\npraise and honour. For S. Antonio, likewise in that city, he painted\\na panel wherein is a Madonna, with S. Mary Magdalene; and near them\\nis a boy in the guise of a little angel, holding a book in his hand,\\nwho is smiling, with a smile that seems so natural that he moves\\nwhoever beholds him to smile also, nor can any person, be his nature\\never so melancholy, see him without being cheered. There is also a\\nS. Jerome; and the whole work is coloured in a manner so wonderful\\nand so astounding, that painters revere it for the marvel of its\\ncolouring, and it is scarcely possible to paint better.\\nIn like manner, he executed square pictures and other paintings for\\nmany lords throughout Lombardy; and, among other works, two pictures\\nin Mantua for Duke Federigo II, to be sent to the Emperor, a gift\\ntruly worthy of such a Prince. Giulio Romano, seeing these works,\\nsaid that he had never seen any colouring that attained to such\\nperfection. One was a naked Leda, and the other a Venus; both so\\nsoft in colouring, with the shadows of the flesh so well wrought,\\nthat they appeared to be not colours, but flesh. In one there was a\\nmarvellous landscape, nor was there ever a Lombard who painted such\\nthings better than he; and, besides this, hair so lovely in colour,\\nand executed in detail with such exquisite finish, that it is not\\npossible to see anything better. There were also certain Loves,\\nexecuted with beautiful art, who were making trial of their arrows,\\nsome of gold and some of lead, on a stone; and what lent most grace\\nto the Venus was a clear and limpid stream, which ran among some\\nstones and bathed her feet, but scarcely concealed any part of them,\\nso that the sight of their delicate whiteness was a moving thing\\nfor the eye to behold. For which reason Antonio most certainly\\ndeserved all praise and honour during his lifetime, and the greatest\\nglory from the lips and pens of men after his death.\\nIn Modena, also, he painted a panel-picture of Our Lady, which is\\nheld in esteem by all painters, as the best picture in that city. In\\nBologna, likewise, in the house of the Ercolani, gentlemen of that\\ncity, there is a work by his hand, a Christ appearing to Mary\\nMagdalene in the Garden, which is very beautiful. In Reggio there\\nwas a rare and most beautiful picture; and not long since, Messer\\nLuciano Pallavigino, who takes much delight in noble paintings,\\npassing through the city and seeing it, gave no thought to the cost,\\nand, as if he had bought a jewel, sent it to his house in Genoa. At\\nReggio, likewise, is a panel containing a Nativity of Christ,\\nwherein the splendour radiating from Him throws its light on the\\nshepherds and all around on the figures that are contemplating Him;\\nand among the many conceptions shown in that subject, there is a\\nwoman who, wishing to gaze intently at Christ, and not being able\\nwith her mortal sight to bear the light of His Divinity, which seems\\nto be beating upon her with its rays, places a hand before her eyes;\\nwhich is expressed so well that it is a marvel. Over the hut is a\\nchoir of angels singing, who are so well executed, that they appear\\nrather to have rained down from Heaven than to have been made by the\\nhand of a painter. And in the same city there is a little picture, a\\nfoot square, the rarest and most beautiful work that is to be seen\\nby his hand, of Christ in the Garden, representing an effect of\\nnight, and painted with little figures; wherein the Angel, appearing\\nto Christ, illumines Him with the splendour of his light, with such\\ntruth to nature, that nothing better can be imagined or expressed.\\nBelow, on a plain at the foot of the mountain, are seen the three\\nApostles sleeping, over whom the mountain on which Christ is praying\\ncasts a shadow, giving those figures a force which one is not able\\nto describe. Far in the background, over a distant landscape, there\\nis shown the appearing of the dawn; and on one side are seen coming\\nsome soldiers, with Judas. And although it is so small, this scene\\nis so well conceived, that there is no work of the same kind to\\nequal it either in patience or in study.\\nMany things might be said of the works of this master; but since,\\namong the eminent men of our art, everything that is to be seen by\\nhis hand is admired as something divine, I will say no more. I have\\nused all possible diligence in order to obtain his portrait, but,\\nsince he himself did not make it, and he was never portrayed by\\nothers, for he always lived in retirement, I have not been able to\\nfind one. He was, in truth, a person who had no opinion of himself,\\nnor did he believe himself to be an able master of his art,\\ncontrasting his deficiencies with that perfection which he would\\nhave liked to achieve. He was contented with little, and he lived\\nlike an excellent Christian.\\nAntonio, like a man who was weighed down by his family, was anxious\\nto be always saving, and he had thereby become as miserly as he\\ncould well be. Wherefore it is related that, having received at\\nParma a payment of sixty crowns in copper coins, and wishing to take\\nthem to Correggio to meet some demand, he placed the money on his\\nback and set out to walk on foot; but, being smitten by the heat of\\nthe sun, which was very great, and drinking water to refresh\\nhimself, he was seized by pleurisy, and had to take to his bed in a\\nraging fever, nor did he ever raise his head from it, but finished\\nthe course of his life at the age of forty, or thereabout.\\nHis pictures date about 1512; and he bestowed a very great gift on\\npainting by his handling of colours, which was that of a true\\nmaster; and it was by means of him that men's eyes were opened in\\nLombardy, where so many beautiful intellects have been seen in\\npainting, following him in making works worthy of praise and memory.\\nThus, by showing them his treatment of hair, executed with such\\nfacility, for all the difficulty of painting it, he taught them how\\nit should be painted; for which all painters owe him an everlasting\\ndebt. At their instance the following epigram was written to him by\\nMesser Fabio Segni, a gentleman of Florence:\\n  Hujus cum regeret mortales spiritus artus\\n    Pictoris, Charites supplicuere Jovi.\\n  Non alia pingi dextra, Pater alme, rogamus;\\n    Hunc præter, nulli pingere nos liceat.\\n  Annuit his votis summi regnator Olympi,\\n    Et juvenem subito sidera ad alta tulit,\\n  Ut posset melius Charitum simulacra referre\\n    Præsens, et nudas cerneret inde Deas.\\nAt this same time lived Andrea del Gobbo of Milan, a very pleasing\\npainter and colourist, many of whose works are scattered about in\\nthe houses of his native city of Milan. There is a large\\npanel-picture of the Assumption of Our Lady, by his hand, in the\\nCertosa of Pavia, but it was left unfinished, on account of death\\novertaking him; which panel shows how excellent he was, and how\\ngreat a lover of the labours of art.\", 'PIERO DI COSIMO\\nPAINTER OF FLORENCE\\nWhile Giorgione and Correggio, to their own great credit and glory,\\nwere honouring the regions of Lombardy, Tuscany, on her part, was\\nnot wanting in men of beautiful intellect; among whom, not one of\\nthe least was Piero, the son of one Lorenzo, a goldsmith, and a\\npupil of Cosimo Rosselli, after whom he was always called Piero di\\nCosimo, and known by no other name. And in truth, when a man teaches\\nus excellence and gives us the secret of living rightly, he deserves\\nno less gratitude from us, and should be held no less as a true\\nfather, than he who begets us and gives us life and nothing more.\\nPiero was entrusted by his father, who saw in his son a lively\\nintelligence and an inclination to the art of design, to the care of\\nCosimo, who took him with no ordinary willingness; and seeing him\\ngrow no less in ability than in years, among the many disciples that\\nhe had, he bore him love as to a son, and always held him as such.\\nThis young man had by nature a most lofty spirit, and he was very\\nstrange, and different in fancy from the other youths who were\\nworking with Cosimo in order to learn the same art. He was at times\\nso intent on what he was doing, that when some subject was being\\ndiscussed, as often happens, at the end of the discussion it was\\nnecessary to go back to the beginning and tell him the whole, so far\\nhad his brain wandered after some other fancy of his own. And he was\\nlikewise so great a lover of solitude, that he knew no pleasure save\\nthat of going off by himself with his thoughts, letting his fancy\\nroam and building his castles in the air. Right good reason had\\nCosimo, his master, for wishing him well, seeing that he made so\\nmuch use of him in his works, that very often he caused him to\\nexecute things of great importance, knowing that Piero had a more\\nbeautiful manner, as well as better judgment, than himself. For this\\nreason he took Piero with him to Rome, when he was summoned thither\\nby Pope Sixtus in order to paint the scenes in his chapel; in one of\\nwhich Piero executed a very beautiful landscape, as was related in\\nthe Life of Cosimo.\\nAnd since Piero drew most excellently from the life, he made in Rome\\nmany portraits of distinguished persons; in particular, those of\\nVirginio Orsino and Ruberto Sanseverino, which he placed in the\\naforesaid scenes. Afterwards, also, he made a portrait of Duke\\nValentino, the son of Pope Alexander VI; which painting, to my\\nknowledge, is not now to be found; but the cartoon by his hand still\\nexists, being in the possession of the reverend and cultured M.\\nCosimo Bartoli, Provost of S. Giovanni. In Florence, he painted many\\npictures for a number of citizens, which are dispersed among their\\nvarious houses, and of such I have seen some that are very good; and\\nso, also, various things for many other persons. In the Noviciate of\\nS. Marco is a picture by his hand of Our Lady, standing, with the\\nChild in her arms, coloured in oils. And for the Chapel of Gino\\nCapponi, in the Church of S. Spirito at Florence, he painted a panel\\nwherein is the Visitation of Our Lady, with S. Nicholas, and a S.\\nAnthony who is reading with a pair of spectacles on his nose, a very\\nspirited figure. Here he counterfeited a book bound in parchment,\\nsomewhat old, which seems to be real, and also some balls that he\\ngave to the S. Nicholas, shining and casting gleams of light and\\nreflections from one to another; from which even by that time men\\ncould perceive the strangeness of his brain, and his constant\\nseeking after difficulties.\\nEven better did he show this after the death of Cosimo, when he kept\\nhimself constantly shut up, and would not let himself be seen at\\nwork, leading the life of a man who was less man than beast. He\\nwould never have his rooms swept, he would only eat when hunger came\\nto him, and he would not let his garden be worked or his fruit-trees\\npruned; nay, he allowed his vines to grow, and the shoots to trail\\nover the ground, nor were his fig-trees ever trimmed, or any other\\ntrees, for it pleased him to see everything wild, like his own\\nnature; and he declared that Nature\\'s own things should be left to\\nher to look after, without lifting a hand to them. He set himself\\noften to observe such animals, plants, or other things as Nature at\\ntimes creates out of caprice, or by chance; in which he found a\\npleasure and satisfaction that drove him quite out of his mind with\\ndelight; and he spoke of them so often in his discourse, that at\\ntimes, although he found pleasure in them, it became wearisome to\\nothers. He would sometimes stop to gaze at a wall against which sick\\npeople had been for a long time discharging their spittle, and from\\nthis he would picture to himself battles of horsemen, and the most\\nfantastic cities and widest landscapes that were ever seen; and he\\ndid the same with the clouds in the sky.\\nHe gave his attention to colouring in oils, having seen some works\\nof Leonardo\\'s, executed with that gradation of colour, and finished\\nwith that extraordinary diligence, which Leonardo used to employ\\nwhen he wished to display his art. And so Piero, being pleased with\\nhis method, sought to imitate it, although he was afterwards very\\ndistant from Leonardo, and worlds away from any other manner. It may\\nbe said, in truth, that he changed his manner almost for every work\\nthat he executed.\\nIf Piero had not been so solitary, and had taken more care of\\nhimself in his way of living than he did, he would have made known\\nthe greatness of his intellect in such a way that he would have been\\nrevered, whereas, by reason of his uncouth ways, he was rather held\\nto be a madman, although in the end he did no harm save to himself\\nalone, while his works were beneficial and useful to his art. For\\nwhich reason every good intellect and every excellent craftsman\\nshould always be taught, from such an example, to keep his eyes on\\nthe end of life.\\nNor will I refrain from saying that Piero, in his youth, being\\nfanciful and extravagant in invention, was much employed for the\\nmasquerades that are held during the Carnival; and he became very\\ndear to the young noblemen of Florence, having improved their\\nfestivals much in invention, adornment, grandeur, and pomp. As to\\nthat kind of pastime, it is said that he was one of the first to\\ncontrive to marshal them in the form of triumphal processions; at\\nleast, he improved them greatly, by accompanying the invention of\\nthe story represented, not only with music and with words suited to\\nthe subject, but also with a train of incredible pomp, formed of\\nmen on foot and on horseback, with habits and ornaments in keeping\\nwith the story; which produced a very rich and beautiful effect, and\\nhad in it something both grand and ingenious. And it was certainly a\\nvery beautiful thing to see, by night, twenty-five or thirty pairs\\nof horses, most richly caparisoned, with their riders in costume,\\naccording to the subject of the invention, and six or eight grooms\\nto each rider, with torches in their hands, and all clothed in one\\nand the same livery, sometimes more than four hundred in number; and\\nthen the chariot, or triumphal car, covered with ornaments,\\ntrophies, and most bizarre things of fancy; altogether, a thing\\nwhich makes men\\'s intellects more subtle, and gives great pleasure\\nand satisfaction to the people.\\nAmong these spectacles, which were numerous and ingenious, it is my\\npleasure to give a brief description of one, which was contrived\\nmostly by Piero, when he was already of a mature age, and which was\\nnot, like many, pleasing through its beauty, but, on the contrary,\\non account of a strange, horrible, and unexpected invention, gave no\\nlittle satisfaction to the people: for even as in the matter of food\\nbitter things sometimes give marvellous delight to the human palate,\\nso do horrible things in such pastimes, if only they be carried out\\nwith judgment and art; which is evident in the representation of\\ntragedies. This was the Car of Death, wrought by him with the\\ngreatest secrecy in the Sala del Papa, so that nothing could ever be\\nfound out about it, until it was seen and known at one and the same\\nmoment. This triumphal chariot was an enormous car drawn by\\nbuffaloes, black all over and painted with skeletons and white\\ncrosses; and upon the highest point of the car stood a colossal\\nfigure of Death, scythe in hand, and right round the car were a\\nnumber of covered tombs; and at all the places where the procession\\nhalted for the chanting of dirges, these tombs opened, and from them\\nissued figures draped in black cloth, upon which were painted all\\nthe bones of a skeleton, over their arms, breasts, flanks, and legs;\\nwhich, what with the white over the black, and the appearing in the\\ndistance of some figures carrying torches, with masks that\\nrepresented a death\\'s head both in front and behind, as well as the\\nneck, not only gave an appearance of the greatest reality, but was\\nalso horrible and terrifying to behold. And these figures of the\\ndead, at the sound of certain muffled trumpets, low and mournful in\\ntone, came half out of their tombs, and, seating themselves upon\\nthem, sang to music full of melancholy that song so celebrated at\\nthe present day: \"Dolor, pianto, e penitenzia.\" Before and after the\\ncar came a great number of the dead, riding on certain horses picked\\nout with the greatest diligence from among the leanest and most\\nmeagre that could be found, with black caparisons covered with white\\ncrosses; and each had four grooms draped in the garb of death, with\\nblack torches, and a large black standard with crosses, bones, and\\ndeath\\'s heads. After the car were trailed ten black standards; and\\nas they walked, the whole company sang in unison, with trembling\\nvoices, that Psalm of David that is called the Miserere.\\nThis dread spectacle, through its novelty and terror, as I have\\nsaid, filled the whole city with fear and marvel together; and\\nalthough at the first sight it did not seem suited to a Carnival,\\nnevertheless, being new and very well arranged, it pleased the minds\\nof all, and Piero, the creator and inventor of the whole, gained\\nconsummate praise and commendation for it; and it was the reason\\nthat afterwards, going from one thing to another, men continued to\\ncontrive lively and ingenious inventions, so that in truth, for such\\nrepresentations and for holding similar festivals, this city has\\nnever had an equal. And in those old men who saw it there still\\nremains a vivid memory of it, nor are they ever weary of celebrating\\nthis fantastic invention. I have heard from the lips of Andrea di\\nCosimo, who helped him to carry out the work, and of Andrea del\\nSarto, who was Piero\\'s disciple, and who also had a hand in it, that\\nit was a common opinion at that time that this invention was\\nintended to foreshadow the return of the Medici family to Florence\\nin the year 1512, since at the time when the procession was held\\nthey were exiles, and, so to speak, dead, but destined in a short\\ntime to come to life; and in this sense were interpreted the\\nfollowing words in the song--\\n  Morti siam come vedete,\\n  Così morti vedrem voi;\\n  Fummo già come voi siete,\\n  Voi sarete come noi, etc.\\nwhereby men wished to signify the return of that family (a\\nresurrection, as it were, from death to life), and the expulsion and\\nabasement of their enemies; or it may have been that many gave it\\nthat significance from the subsequent fact of the return of that\\nillustrious house to Florence--so prone is the human intellect to\\napplying every word and act that has come previously, to the events\\nthat happen afterwards. Certain it is that this was the opinion of\\nmany at that time; and it was much spoken of.\\nBut to return to the art and actions of Piero; he was given the\\ncommission for a panel in the Church of the Servite Friars, in the\\nChapel of the Tedaldi, where they keep the garment and the pillow of\\nS. Filippo, a brother of their Order; wherein he depicted Our Lady\\nstanding, raised from the ground on a pedestal, and uplifting her\\nhead towards Heaven, with a book in her hand, but without her Son;\\nand above her is the Holy Spirit, bathing her with light. Nor did he\\nwish that any other light than that of the Dove should illumine her\\nand the figures that are round her, such as a S. Margaret and a S.\\nCatherine, who are on their knees, adoring her, while S. Peter and\\nS. John the Evangelist are standing, contemplating her, together\\nwith S. Filippo, the Servite Friar, and S. Antonino, Archbishop of\\nFlorence. Moreover, he made there a landscape that is very bizarre,\\nwhat with the strange trees and certain grottoes. And in truth,\\nthere are some very beautiful things in this work, such as certain\\nheads that reveal both draughtsmanship and grace; besides the\\ncolouring, which is very harmonious, for it is certain that Piero\\nwas a great master of colouring in oils. In the predella he painted\\nsome little scenes, very well executed; and, among others, there is\\none of S. Margaret issuing from the belly of the Dragon, wherein he\\nmade that animal so monstrous and hideous, that I do not think that\\nthere is anything better of that kind to be seen, for with its eyes\\nit reveals venom, fire, and death, in an aspect truly terrifying.\\nAnd certainly, as for such things, I do not believe that any one\\never did them better than he, or came near him in imagining them; to\\nwhich witness is borne by a marine monster that he made and\\npresented to the Magnificent Giuliano de\\' Medici, which is so\\nextravagant, bizarre, and fantastic in its deformity, that it seems\\nimpossible that Nature should produce anything so deformed and\\nstrange among her creations. This monster is now in the guardaroba\\nof Duke Cosimo de\\' Medici, as is also a book, likewise by the hand\\nof Piero, of animals of the same kind, most beautiful and bizarre,\\nhatched very diligently with the pen, and finished with an\\nincredible patience; which book was presented to him by M. Cosimo\\nBartoli, Provost of S. Giovanni, who is very much my friend, as he\\nis of all our craftsmen, being a man who has always delighted, and\\nstill delights, in our profession.\\nHe also executed, round a chamber in the house of Francesco del\\nPugliese, various scenes with little figures; nor is it possible to\\ndescribe the different fantastic things that he delighted to paint\\nin all those scenes, what with the buildings, the animals, the\\ncostumes, the various instruments, and any other fanciful things\\nthat came into his head, since the stories were drawn from fables.\\nThese scenes, after the death of Francesco del Pugliese and his\\nsons, were taken away, nor do I know what has become of them; and\\nthe same thing has happened to a picture of Mars and Venus, with her\\nLoves and Vulcan, executed with great art and with an incredible\\npatience.\\nPiero painted, for the elder Filippo Strozzi, a picture with little\\nfigures of Perseus delivering Andromeda from the Monster, in which\\nare some very beautiful things. It is now in the house of Signor\\nSforza Almeni, First Chamberlain to Duke Cosimo, having been\\npresented to him by Messer Giovanni Battista, the son of Lorenzo\\nStrozzi, who knew how much that nobleman delighted in painting and\\nsculpture; and he holds it in great account, for Piero never made a\\nmore lovely or more highly finished picture than this one, seeing\\nthat it is not possible to find a more bizarre or more fantastic\\nsea-monster than that which Piero imagined and painted, or a fiercer\\nattitude than that of Perseus, who is raising his sword in the air\\nto smite the beast. In it, trembling between fear and hope,\\nAndromeda is seen bound, most beautiful in countenance; and in the\\nforeground are many people in various strange costumes, playing\\ninstruments and singing; among whom are some heads, smiling and\\nrejoicing at seeing the deliverance of Andromeda, that are divine.\\nThe landscape is very beautiful, and the colouring sweet and full of\\ngrace. In short, with regard to the harmony and gradation of the\\ncolours, he executed this work with the greatest possible diligence.\\nHe painted, also, a picture containing a nude Venus, with a Mars,\\nlikewise nude, who is sleeping in a meadow full of flowers, and all\\naround are various Loves, who are carrying away, some here, some\\nthere, the helmet, armlets, and other pieces of armour of Mars;\\nthere is a grove of myrtle, with a Cupid that is afraid of a rabbit,\\nand there are also the Doves of Venus and the other emblems of Love.\\nThis picture is at Florence, in the house of Giorgio Vasari, who\\nkeeps it in memory of that master, whose caprices have always\\npleased him.\\nThe Director of the Hospital of the Innocenti was much the friend of\\nPiero; and wishing to have a panel painted, which was to be placed\\nin the Pugliese Chapel, near the entrance into the church, on the\\nleft hand, he gave the commission for it to Piero, who brought it to\\ncompletion at his leisure; but first he reduced his patron to\\ndespair, for on no account would he let him see it until it was\\nfinished. How strange this seemed to the patron, both because of\\ntheir friendship, and because of his supplying Piero continually\\nwith money, without seeing what was being done, he himself showed,\\nwhen, on the occasion of the final payment, he refused to give it to\\nhim without seeing the work. But, on Piero threatening that he would\\ndestroy all that he had painted, he was forced to give him the rest,\\nand to wait patiently, in a greater rage than ever, for it to be set\\nin place. This picture contains much that is truly beautiful.\\nHe undertook to paint a panel for a chapel in the Church of S. Piero\\nGattolini, and in this he represented Our Lady seated, with four\\nfigures round her, and two angels in the sky, who are crowning her;\\nwhich work, executed with such diligence that it brought him praise\\nand honour, is now to be seen in S. Friano, the other church having\\nbeen ruined. For the tramezzo of the Church of S. Francesco, at\\nFiesole, he painted a little panel-picture of the Conception, which\\nis a passing good little work, the figures being of no great size.\\nFor Giovanni Vespucci, who lived in a house now belonging to Piero\\nSalviati, opposite to S. Michele, in the Via de\\' Servi, he executed\\nsome bacchanalian scenes, which are round an apartment; wherein he\\nmade such strange fauns, satyrs, sylvan gods, little boys, and\\nbacchanals, that it is a marvel to see the diversity of the bay\\nhorses and garments, and the variety of the goatlike features, and\\nall with great grace and most vivid truth to nature. In one scene is\\nSilenus riding on an ass, with many children, some supporting him,\\nand some giving him drink; and throughout the whole is a feeling of\\nthe joy of life, produced by the great genius of Piero. And in\\ntruth, in all that there is to be seen by his hand, one recognizes a\\nspirit very different and far distant from that of other painters,\\nand a certain subtlety in the investigation of some of the deepest\\nand most subtle secrets of Nature, without grudging time or labour,\\nbut only for his own delight and for his pleasure in the art. And it\\ncould not well be otherwise; since, having grown enamoured of her,\\nhe cared nothing for his own comfort, and reduced himself to eating\\nnothing but boiled eggs, which, in order to save firing, he cooked\\nwhen he was boiling his glue, and not six or eight at a time, but in\\nfifties; and, keeping them in a basket, he would eat them one by\\none. In this life he found such peculiar pleasure that any other, in\\ncomparison with his own, seemed to him slavery. He could not bear\\nthe crying of children, the coughing of men, the sound of bells, and\\nthe chanting of friars; and when the rain was pouring in torrents\\nfrom the sky, it pleased him to see it streaming straight down from\\nthe roofs and splashing on the ground. He had the greatest terror of\\nlightning; and, when he heard very loud thunder, he wrapped himself\\nin his mantle, and, having closed the windows and the door of the\\nroom, he crouched in a corner until the storm should pass. He was\\nvery varied and original in his discourse, and sometimes said such\\nbeautiful things, that he made his hearers burst with laughter. But\\nwhen he was old, and near the age of eighty, he had become so\\nstrange and eccentric that nothing could be done with him. He would\\nnot have assistants standing round him, so that his misanthropy had\\nrobbed him of all possible aid. He was sometimes seized by a desire\\nto work, but was not able, by reason of the palsy, and fell into\\nsuch a rage that he tried to force his hands to labour; but, as he\\nmuttered to himself, the mahlstick fell from his grasp, and even his\\nbrushes, so that it was pitiable to behold. Flies enraged him, and\\neven shadows annoyed him. And so, having become ill through old age,\\nhe was visited by one or two friends, who besought him to make his\\npeace with God; but he would not believe that he was dying, and put\\nthem off from one day to another; not that he was hard of heart, or\\nan unbeliever, for he was a most zealous Christian, although his\\nlife was that of a beast. He discoursed at times on the torments of\\nthose ills that destroy men\\'s bodies, and of the suffering endured\\nby those who come to die with their strength wasting away little by\\nlittle, which he called a great affliction. He spoke evil of\\nphysicians, apothecaries, and those who nurse the sick, saying that\\nthey cause them to die of hunger; besides the tortures of syrups,\\nmedicines, clysters, and other martyrdoms, such as not being allowed\\nto sleep when you are drowsy, making your will, seeing your\\nrelatives round you, and staying in a dark room. He praised death by\\nthe hand of justice, saying that it was a fine thing to go to your\\ndeath in that way; to see the broad sky about you, and all that\\nthrong; to be comforted with sweetmeats and with kind words; to have\\nthe priest and the people praying for you; and to go into Paradise\\nwith the Angels; so that whoever departed from this life at one\\nblow, was very fortunate. And as he discoursed, he would twist\\neverything to the strangest meanings that were ever heard.\\nWherefore, living in such strange fashion, he reduced himself to\\nsuch a state with his extravagant fancies, that one morning he was\\nfound dead at the foot of a staircase, in the year 1521; and he was\\ngiven burial in S. Piero Maggiore.\\nHis disciples were many, and one among them was Andrea del Sarto,\\nwho was a host in himself. Piero\\'s portrait I received from\\nFrancesco da San Gallo, who was much his friend and intimate\\ncompanion, and who made it when Piero was old; which Francesco still\\nhas a work by the hand of Piero that I must not pass by, a very\\nbeautiful head of Cleopatra, with an asp wound round her neck, and\\ntwo portraits, one of his father Giuliano, and the other of his\\ngrandfather Francesco Giamberti, which seem to be alive.', 'BRAMANTE DA URBINO\\nARCHITECT\\nOf very great advantage to architecture, in truth, was the new\\nmethod of Filippo Brunelleschi, who imitated and restored to the\\nlight, after many ages, the noble works of the most learned and\\nmarvellous ancients. But no less useful to our age was Bramante, in\\nfollowing the footsteps of Filippo, and making the path of his\\nprofession of architecture secure for all who came after him, by\\nmeans of his courage, boldness, intellect, and science in that art,\\nwherein he had the mastery not of theory only, but of supreme skill\\nand practice. Nor could nature have created a more vigorous\\nintellect, or one to exercise his art and carry it into execution\\nwith greater invention and proportion, or with a more thorough\\nknowledge, than Bramante. But no less essential than all this was\\nthe election to the Pontificate, at that time, of Julius II, a Pope\\nof great spirit, full of desire to leave memorials behind him. And\\nit was fortunate both for us and for Bramante that he found such a\\nPrince (a thing which rarely happens to men of great genius), at\\nwhose expense he might be able to display the worth of his\\nintellect, and that mastery over difficulties which he showed in\\narchitecture. His ability was so universal in the buildings that he\\nerected, that the outlines of the cornices, the shafts of the\\ncolumns, the graceful capitals, the bases, the consoles and corners,\\nthe vaults, the staircases, the projections, and every detail of\\nevery Order of architecture, contrived from the counsel or model of\\nthis craftsman, never failed to astonish all who saw them. Wherefore\\nit appears to me that the everlasting gratitude which is due to the\\nancients from the intellects that study their works, is also due\\nfrom them to the labours of Bramante; for if the Greeks were the\\ninventors of architecture, and the Romans their imitators, Bramante\\nnot only imitated what he saw, with new invention, and taught it to\\nus, but also added very great beauty and elaboration to the art,\\nwhich we see embellished by him at the present day.\\nHe was born at Castel Durante, in the State of Urbino, of poor but\\nhonest parentage. In his boyhood, besides reading and writing, he\\ngave much attention to arithmetic; but his father, who had need that\\nhe should earn money, perceiving that he delighted much in drawing,\\napplied him, when still a mere boy, to the art of painting;\\nwhereupon Bramante gave much study to the works of Fra Bartolommeo,\\notherwise called Fra Carnovale da Urbino, who painted the\\npanel-picture of S. Maria della Bella at Urbino. But since he always\\ndelighted in architecture and perspective, he departed from Castel\\nDurante, and made his way to Lombardy, where he went now to one\\ncity, and now to another, working as best he could, but not on\\nthings of great cost or much credit, having as yet neither name nor\\nreputation. For this reason he determined at least to see some\\nnoteworthy work, and betook himself to Milan, in order to see the\\nDuomo. In that city there was then living one Cesare Cesariano,\\nreputed to be a good geometrician and an able architect, who wrote a\\ncommentary on Vitruvius, and, out of despair at not having received\\nfor this the remuneration that he had expected, became so strange\\nthat he would work no more; and, having grown almost savage, he died\\nmore like a beast than like a human being. There was also one\\nBernardino da Trevio, a Milanese, engineer and architect for the\\nDuomo, and an excellent draughtsman, who was held by Leonardo da\\nVinci to be a rare master, although his manner was rather crude and\\nsomewhat hard in painting. By his hand is a Resurrection of Christ\\nto be seen at the upper end of the cloister of the Grazie, with some\\nvery beautiful foreshortenings; and a chapel in fresco in S.\\nFrancesco, containing the deaths of S. Peter and S. Paul. He painted\\nmany other works in Milan, and he also made a good number in the\\nsurrounding district, which are held in esteem; and in our book\\nthere is a head of a very beautiful woman, in charcoal and\\nlead-white, which still bears witness to the manner that he\\nfollowed.\\nBut to return to Bramante; having studied that building, and having\\ncome to know those engineers, he so took courage, that he resolved\\nto devote himself wholly to architecture. Having therefore departed\\nfrom Milan, he betook himself, just before the holy year of 1500, to\\nRome, where he was recognized by some friends, both from his own\\ncountry and from Lombardy, and received a commission to paint, over\\nthe Porta Santa of S. Giovanni Laterano, which is opened for the\\nJubilee, the coat of arms of Pope Alexander VI, to be executed in\\nfresco, with angels and other figures acting as supporters.\\nBramante had brought some money from Lombardy, and he earned some\\nmore in Rome by executing certain works; and this he spent with the\\ngreatest economy, since he wished to be able to live independently,\\nand at the same time, without having to work, to be free to take\\nmeasurements, at his ease, of all the ancient buildings in Rome. And\\nhaving put his hand to this, he set out, alone with his thoughts;\\nand within no great space of time he had measured all the buildings\\nin that city and in the Campagna without; and he went as far as\\nNaples, and wherever he knew that there were antiquities. He\\nmeasured all that was at Tivoli and in the Villa of Hadrian, and, as\\nwill be related afterwards in the proper place, made great use of\\nit. The mind of Bramante becoming known in this way, the Cardinal of\\nNaples, having noticed him, began to favour him. Whereupon, while\\nBramante was continuing his studies, the desire came to the said\\nCardinal to have the cloister of the Frati della Pace rebuilt in\\ntravertine, and he gave the charge of this cloister to Bramante, and\\nhe, desiring to earn money and to gain the good will of that\\nCardinal, set himself to work with all possible industry and\\ndiligence, and brought it quickly to perfect completion. And\\nalthough it was not a work of perfect beauty, it gave him a very\\ngreat name, since there were not many in Rome who followed the\\nprofession of architecture with such zeal, study, and resolution as\\nBramante.\\nAt the beginning he served as under-architect to Pope Alexander VI\\nfor the fountain of Trastevere, and likewise for that which was made\\non the Piazza di S. Pietro. He also took part, together with other\\nexcellent architects, when his reputation had increased, in the\\nplanning of a great part of the Palace of S. Giorgio, and of the\\nChurch of S. Lorenzo in Damaso, at the commission of Raffaello\\nRiario, Cardinal of S. Giorgio, near the Campo di Fiore; which\\npalace, whatever better work may have been executed afterwards,\\nnevertheless was and still is held, on account of its greatness, to\\nbe a commodious and magnificent habitation; and the building of this\\nedifice was carried out by one Antonio Montecavallo. Bramante was\\nconsulted with regard to the enlargement of S. Jacopo degli\\nSpagnuoli, on the Piazza Navona, and likewise in the deliberations\\nfor the building of S. Maria de Anima, which was afterwards carried\\nout by a German architect. From his design, also, was the Palace of\\nCardinal Adriano da Corneto in the Borgo Nuovo, which was built\\nslowly, and then finally remained unfinished by reason of the flight\\nof that Cardinal; and in like manner, the enlargement of the\\nprincipal chapel of S. Maria del Popolo was executed from his\\ndesign.\\nThese works brought him so much credit in Rome, that he was\\nconsidered the best architect, in that he was resolute, prompt, and\\nmost fertile in invention; and he was continually employed by all\\nthe great persons in that city for their most important\\nundertakings. Wherefore, after Julius II had been elected Pope, in\\nthe year 1503, he entered into his service. The fancy had taken that\\nPontiff to so transform the space that lay between the Belvedere and\\nthe Papal Palace, as to give it the aspect of a square theatre,\\nembracing a little valley that ran between the old Papal Palace and\\nthe new buildings that Innocent VIII had erected as a habitation for\\nthe Popes; and he intended, by means of two corridors, one on either\\nside of this little valley, to make it possible to go from the\\nBelvedere to the Palace under loggie, and also to go from the Palace\\nto the Belvedere in the same way, and likewise, by means of various\\nflights of steps, to ascend to the level of the Belvedere. Whereupon\\nBramante, who had very good judgment and an inventive genius in such\\nmatters, distributed two ranges of columns along the lowest part;\\nfirst, a very beautiful Doric loggia, similar to the Colosseum of\\nthe Savelli (although, in place of half-columns, he used pilasters),\\nand all built of travertine; and over this a second range of the\\nIonic Order, full of windows, of such a height as to come to the\\nlevel of the first-floor rooms of the Papal Palace, and to the\\nlevel of those of the Belvedere; intending to make, afterwards, a\\nloggia more than four hundred paces long on the side towards Rome,\\nand likewise another on the side towards the wood, with which, one\\non either hand, he proposed to enclose the valley; into which, after\\nit had been levelled, was to be brought all the water from the\\nBelvedere; and for this a very beautiful fountain was to be made. Of\\nthis design, Bramante finished the first corridor, which issues from\\nthe Palace and leads to the Belvedere on the side towards Rome,\\nexcept the upper loggia, which was to go above it. As for the\\nopposite part, on the side towards the wood, the foundations,\\nindeed, were laid, but it could not be finished, being interrupted\\nby the death of Julius, and then by that of Bramante. His design was\\nheld to be so beautiful in invention, that it was believed that from\\nthe time of the ancients until that day, Rome had seen nothing\\nbetter. But of the other corridor, as has been said, he left only\\nthe foundations, and the labour of finishing it has dragged on down\\nto our own day, when Pius IV has brought it almost to completion.\\nBramante also erected the head-wall of the Museum of ancient statues\\nin the Belvedere, together with the range of niches; wherein were\\nplaced, in his lifetime, the Laocoon, one of the rarest of ancient\\nstatues, the Apollo, and the Venus; and the rest of the statues were\\nset up there afterwards by Leo X, such as the Tiber, the Nile, and\\nthe Cleopatra, with some others added by Clement VII; and in the\\ntime of Paul III and Julius III many important improvements were\\nmade, at great expense.\\nBut to return to Bramante; he was very resolute, although he was\\nhindered by the avarice of those who supplied him with the means to\\nwork, and he had a marvellous knowledge of the craft of building.\\nThis construction at the Belvedere was executed by him with\\nextraordinary speed, and such was his eagerness as he worked, and\\nthat of the Pope, who would have liked to see the edifice spring up\\nfrom the ground, without needing to be built, that the builders of\\nthe foundations brought the sand and the solid foundation-clay by\\nnight and let it down by day in the presence of Bramante, who\\ncaused the foundations to be made without seeing anything more of\\nthe work. This inadvertence was the reason that all his buildings\\nhave cracked, and are in danger of falling down, as did this same\\ncorridor, of which a piece eighty braccia in length fell to the\\nground in the time of Clement VII, and was afterwards rebuilt by\\nPope Paul III, who also had the foundations restored and the whole\\nstrengthened.\\nFrom his design, also, are many flights of steps in the Belvedere,\\nvaried according to their situations, whether high or low, in the\\nDoric, Ionic, and Corinthian Orders--a very beautiful work, executed\\nwith extraordinary grace. And he had made a model for the whole,\\nwhich is said to have been a marvellous thing, as may still be\\nimagined from the beginning of the work, unfinished as it is.\\nMoreover, he made a spiral staircase upon mounting columns, in such\\na way that one can ascend it on horseback; wherein the Doric passes\\ninto the Ionic, and the Ionic into the Corinthian, rising from one\\ninto the other; a work executed with supreme grace, and with truly\\nexcellent art, which does him no less honour than any other thing by\\nhis hand that is therein. This invention was copied by Bramante from\\nS. Niccolò at Pisa, as was said in the Lives of Giovanni and Niccola\\nof Pisa.\\nThe fancy took Bramante to make, in a frieze on the outer façade of\\nthe Belvedere, some letters after the manner of ancient\\nhieroglyphics, representing the name of the Pope and his own, in\\norder to show his ingenuity: and he had begun thus, \"Julio II, Pont.\\nMassimo,\" having caused a head in profile of Julius Cæsar to be\\nmade, and a bridge, with two arches, which signified, \"Julio II,\\nPont.,\" and an obelisk from the Circus Maximus, to represent \"Max.\"\\nAt which the Pope laughed, and caused him to make the letters in the\\nancient manner, one braccio in height, which are there at the\\npresent day; saying that he had copied this folly from a door at\\nViterbo, over which one Maestro Francesco, an architect, had placed\\nhis name, carved in the architrave, and represented by a S. Francis\\n(S. Francesco), an arch (arco), a roof (tetto), and a tower (torre),\\nwhich, interpreted in his own way, denoted, \"Maestro Francesco\\nArchitettore.\" The Pope, on account of his ability in architecture,\\nwas very well disposed towards him.\\nFor these reasons he was rightly held worthy by the aforesaid Pope,\\nwho loved him very dearly for his great gifts, to be appointed to\\nthe Office of the Piombo, for which he made a machine for printing\\nBulls, with a very beautiful screw. In the service of that Pontiff\\nBramante went to Bologna, in the year 1504, when that city returned\\nto the Church; and he occupied himself, throughout the whole war\\nagainst Mirandola, on many ingenious things of the greatest\\nimportance. He made many designs for ground-plans and complete\\nbuildings, which he drew very well; and of such there are some to be\\nseen in our book, accurately drawn and executed with very great art.\\nHe taught many of the rules of architecture to Raffaello da Urbino;\\ndesigning for him, for example, the buildings that Raffaello\\nafterwards drew in perspective in that apartment of the Pope wherein\\nthere is Mount Parnassus; in which apartment he made a portrait of\\nBramante taking measurements with a pair of compasses.\\nThe Pope resolved, having had the Strada Julia straightened out by\\nBramante, to place in it all the public offices and tribunals of\\nRome, on account of the convenience which this would bring to the\\nmerchants in their business, which up to that time had always been\\nmuch hindered. Wherefore Bramante made a beginning with the palace\\nthat is to be seen by S. Biagio sul Tevere, wherein there is still\\nan unfinished Corinthian temple, a thing of rare excellence. The\\nrest of this beginning is in rustic work, and most beautiful; and it\\nis a great pity that a work so honourable, useful, and magnificent,\\nwhich is held by the masters of the profession to be the most\\nbeautiful example of design in that kind that has ever been seen,\\nshould not have been finished. He made, also, in the first cloister\\nof S. Pietro a Montorio, a round temple of travertine, than which\\nnothing more shapely or better conceived, whether in proportion,\\ndesign, variety, or grace, could be imagined; and even more\\nbeautiful would it have been, if the whole extent of the cloister,\\nwhich is not finished, had been brought to the form that is to be\\nseen in a drawing by his hand. He directed the building, in the\\nBorgo, of the palace which afterwards belonged to Raffaello da\\nUrbino, executed with bricks and mould-castings, the columns and\\nbosses being of the Doric Order and of rustic work--a very\\nbeautiful work--with a new invention in the making of these\\ncastings. He also made the design and preparations for the\\ndecoration of S. Maria at Loreto, which was afterwards continued by\\nAndrea Sansovino; and an endless number of models for palaces and\\ntemples, which are in Rome and throughout the States of the Church.\\nSo sublime was the intellect of this marvellous craftsman, that he\\nmade a vast design for restoring and rearranging the Papal Palace.\\nAnd so greatly had his courage grown, on seeing the powers and\\ndesires of the Pope rise to the level of his own wishes and genius,\\nthat, hearing that he was minded to throw the Church of S. Pietro to\\nthe ground, in order to build it anew, he made him an endless number\\nof designs. And among those that he made was one that was very\\nwonderful, wherein he showed the greatest possible judgment, with\\ntwo bell-towers, one on either side of the façade, as we see it in\\nthe coins afterwards struck for Julius II and Leo X by Caradosso, a\\nmost excellent goldsmith, who had no peer in making dies, as may\\nstill be seen from the medal of Bramante, executed by him, which is\\nvery beautiful. And so, the Pope having resolved to make a beginning\\nwith the vast and sublime structure of S. Pietro, Bramante caused\\nhalf of the old church to be pulled down, and put his hand to the\\nwork, with the intention that it should surpass, in beauty, art,\\ninvention, and design, as well as in grandeur, richness, and\\nadornment, all the buildings that had been erected in that city by\\nthe power of the Commonwealth, and by the art and intellect of so\\nmany able masters; and with his usual promptness he laid the\\nfoundations, and carried the greater part of the building, before\\nthe death of the Pope and his own, to the height of the cornice,\\nwhere are the arches to all the four piers; and these he turned with\\nsupreme expedition and art. He also executed the vaulting of the\\nprincipal chapel, where the recess is, giving his attention at the\\nsame time to pressing on the building of the chapel that is called\\nthe Chapel of the King of France.\\nFor this work he invented the method of casting vaults in wooden\\nmoulds, in such a manner that patterns of friezes and foliage, like\\ncarvings, come out in the plaster; and in the arches of this edifice\\nhe showed how they could be turned with flying scaffoldings, a\\nmethod that we have since seen followed by Antonio da San Gallo. In\\nthe part that was finished by him, the cornice that runs right round\\nthe interior is seen to be so graceful, that no other man\\'s hand\\ncould take away or alter anything from its design without spoiling\\nit. It is evident from his capitals, which are of olive leaves\\nwithin, and from all the Doric work on the outer side, which is\\nextraordinarily beautiful, how sublime was the courage of Bramante,\\nwhereby, in truth, if he had possessed physical powers equal to the\\nintellect that adorned his spirit, he would most certainly have\\nachieved even more unexampled things than he did. This work, as will\\nbe related in the proper places, since his death and down to the\\npresent day, has been much mutilated by other architects, insomuch\\nthat it may be said that with the exception of four arches which\\nsupport the tribune, nothing of his has remained there. For\\nRaffaello da Urbino and Giuliano da San Gallo, who carried on the\\nwork after the death of Julius II, together with Fra Giocondo of\\nVerona, thought fit to begin to alter it; and after the death of\\nthose masters, Baldassarre Peruzzi, in building the Chapel of the\\nKing of France, in the transept on the side towards the Campo Santo,\\nchanged Bramante\\'s design; and under Paul III Antonio da San Gallo\\nchanged it again entirely. Finally, Michelagnolo Buonarroti,\\nsweeping away the countless opinions and superfluous expenses, has\\nbrought it to such beauty and perfection as not one of those others\\never thought of, which all comes from his judgment and power of\\ndesign; although he said to me several times that he was only the\\nexecutor of the design and arrangements of Bramante, seeing that he\\nwho originally lays the foundations of a great edifice is its true\\ncreator. Vast, indeed, seemed the conception of Bramante in this\\nwork, and he gave it a very great beginning, which, even if he had\\nbegun on a smaller scale, neither San Gallo nor the others, nor even\\nBuonarroti, would have had enough power of design to increase,\\nalthough they were able to diminish it; so immense, stupendous, and\\nmagnificent was this edifice, and yet Bramante had conceived\\nsomething even greater.\\nIt is said that he was so eager to see this structure making\\nprogress, that he pulled down many beautiful things in S. Pietro,\\nsuch as tombs of Popes, paintings, and mosaics, and that for this\\nreason we have lost all trace of many portraits of distinguished\\npersons, which were scattered throughout that church, which was the\\nprincipal church of all Christendom. He preserved only the altar of\\nS. Pietro, and the old tribune, round which he made a most beautiful\\nornament of the Doric Order, all of peperino-stone, to the end that\\nwhen the Pope came to S. Pietro to say Mass, he might be able to\\nstand within it with all his Court and with the Ambassadors of the\\nChristian Princes; but death prevented him from finishing it\\nentirely, and the Sienese Baldassarre afterwards brought it to\\ncompletion.\\nBramante was a very merry and pleasant person, ever delighting to\\nhelp his neighbour. He was very much the friend of men of ability,\\nand favoured them in whatever way he could; as may be seen from his\\nkindness to the gracious Raffaello da Urbino, most celebrated of\\npainters, whom he brought to Rome. He always lived in the greatest\\nsplendour, doing honour to himself; and in the rank to which his\\nmerits had raised him, what he possessed was nothing to what he\\nwould have been able to spend. He delighted in poetry, and loved to\\nimprovise upon the lyre, or to hear others doing this: and he\\ncomposed some sonnets, if not as polished as we now demand them, at\\nleast weighty and without faults. He was much esteemed by the\\nprelates, and was received by an endless number of noblemen who made\\nhis acquaintance. In his lifetime he had very great renown, and even\\ngreater after his death, because of which the building of S. Pietro\\nwas interrupted for many years. He lived to the age of seventy, and\\nhe was borne to his tomb in Rome, with most honourable obsequies, by\\nthe Court of the Pope and by all the sculptors, architects, and\\npainters. He was buried in S. Pietro, in the year 1514.\\nVery great was the loss that architecture suffered in the death of\\nBramante, who was the discoverer of many good methods wherewith he\\nenriched that art, such as the invention of casting vaults, and the\\nsecret of stucco; both of which were known to the ancients, but had\\nbeen lost until his time through the ruin of their buildings. And\\nthose who occupy themselves with measuring ancient works of\\narchitecture, find in the works of Bramante no less science and\\ndesign than in any of the former; wherefore, among those who are\\nversed in the profession, he can be accounted one of the rarest\\nintellects that have adorned our age. He left behind him an intimate\\nfriend, Giuliano Leno, who had much to do with the buildings of his\\ntime, but was employed rather to make preparations and to carry out\\nthe wishes of whoever designed them, than to work on his own\\naccount, although he had judgment and great experience.\\nDuring his lifetime, Bramante employed in his works one Ventura, a\\ncarpenter of Pistoia, who was a man of very good ability, and drew\\npassing well. This Ventura, while in Rome, delighted much in taking\\nmeasurements of antiquities; and afterwards, wishing to live once\\nmore in his native place, he returned to Pistoia. Now it happened in\\nthat city, in the year 1509, that a Madonna, which is now called the\\nMadonna della Umiltà, worked miracles; and since many offerings were\\nbrought to her, the Signoria that was then governing the city\\ndetermined to build a temple in her honour. Whereupon Ventura,\\nconfronted with this opportunity, made with his own hand a model of\\nan octagonal temple ... braccia in breadth and ... braccia in\\nheight, with a vestibule or closed portico in front, very ornate\\nwithin and truly beautiful. This having given satisfaction to the\\nSignoria and to the chief men of the city, the building was begun\\naccording to the plans of Ventura, who, having laid the foundations\\nof the vestibule and the temple, completely finished the vestibule,\\nwhich he made very rich in pilasters and cornices of the Corinthian\\nOrder, with other carved stonework; while all the vaults in that\\nwork were made in like manner, with squares surrounded by mouldings,\\nalso in stone, and filled with rosettes. Afterwards, the octagonal\\ntemple was also carried to the height of the last cornice, from\\nwhich the vaulting of the tribune was to rise, during the lifetime\\nof Ventura; and since he was not very experienced in works of that\\nsize, he did not consider how the weight of the tribune might be\\nsafely laid on the building, but made within the thickness of the\\nwall, at the first range of windows, and at the second, where the\\nothers are, a passage that runs right round, whereby he contrived to\\nweaken the walls so much, that, the edifice being without buttresses\\nat the base, it was dangerous to raise a vault over it, and\\nparticularly on the angles at the corners, upon which all the weight\\nof the vault of that tribune must rest. Wherefore, after the death\\nof Ventura, there was no architect with courage enough to raise that\\nvault: nay, they had caused long and stout beams of timber to be\\nbrought to the place, in order to make a tent-shaped roof; but this\\ndid not please the citizens, and they would not have it put into\\nexecution. And so the building remained for many years without a\\nroof, until, in the year 1561, the Wardens of Works besought Duke\\nCosimo that his Excellency should so favour them as to cause that\\ntribune to be vaulted. Whereupon, in order to meet their wishes, the\\nDuke ordered Giorgio Vasari to go there and see whether he could\\nfind some method of vaulting it; and he, having done this, made a\\nmodel raising the building to the height of eight braccia above the\\ncornice that Ventura had left, in order to make buttresses for it;\\nand he decreased the breadth of the passage that runs right round\\nbetween the walls, and reinforced the building with buttresses,\\nbesides binding the corners and the parts below the passages that\\nVentura had made, between the windows, with stout keys of iron,\\ndouble at the angles; which secured the whole in such a manner that\\nthe vault could be raised with safety. Whereupon his Excellency was\\npleased to visit the place, and, being satisfied with everything,\\ngave orders for the work to be executed; and so all the buttresses\\nhave been built, and a beginning has already been made with the\\nraising of the cupola. Thus, then, the work of Ventura will become\\nricher, greater in size and adornment, and better in proportions;\\nbut he truly deserves to have record made of him, since that\\nbuilding is the most noteworthy modern work in the city of Pistoia.', \"FRA BARTOLOMMEO DI SAN MARCO\\n[_BACCIO DELLA PORTA_]\\nPAINTER OF FLORENCE\\nNear the territory of Prato, which is ten miles distant from\\nFlorence, in a village called Savignano, was born Bartolommeo,\\nknown, according to the Tuscan custom, by the name of Baccio. He,\\nhaving shown in his childhood not merely inclination, but also\\naptitude, for drawing, was placed, through the good services of\\nBenedetto da Maiano, with Cosimo Rosselli, and lodged in the house\\nof some relatives of his own, who lived at the Porta a S. Piero\\nGattolini; where he stayed for many years, so that he was never\\ncalled or known by any other name than that of Baccio della Porta.\\nAfter taking his leave of Cosimo Rosselli, he began to study with\\ngreat devotion the works of Leonardo da Vinci; and in a short time\\nhe made such proficience and such progress in colouring, that he\\nacquired the name and reputation of being one of the best young men\\nof his art, both in colouring and in drawing. He had a companion in\\nMariotto Albertinelli, who in a short time acquired his manner\\npassing well; and together with him he executed many pictures of Our\\nLady, which are scattered throughout Florence. To speak of all these\\nwould take too long, and I will mention only some excellently\\npainted by Baccio. There is one, containing a Madonna, in the house\\nof Filippo di Averardo Salviati, which is most beautiful, and which\\nhe holds very dear and in great price. Another was bought not long\\nsince, at a sale of old furniture, by Pier Maria delle Pozze, a\\nperson greatly devoted to pictures, who, having recognized its\\nbeauty, will not let it go for any sum of money; in which work is a\\nMadonna executed with extraordinary diligence. Piero del Pugliese\\nhad a little Madonna of marble, in very low relief, a very rare work\\nby the hand of Donatello, for which, in order to do it honour, he\\ncaused a wooden tabernacle to be made, with two little doors to\\nenclose it. This he gave to Baccio della Porta, who painted, on the\\ninner side of the doors, two little scenes, of which one was the\\nNativity of Christ, and the other His Circumcision; which Baccio\\nexecuted with little figures after the manner of miniatures, in such\\na way that it would not be possible to do better work in oils; and\\nthen he painted Our Lady receiving the Annunciation from the Angel,\\nin chiaroscuro, and likewise in oils, on the outer side of the same\\nlittle doors, so as to be seen when they are closed. This work is\\nnow in the study of Duke Cosimo, wherein he keeps all his little\\nantique figures of bronze, medals, and other rare pictures in\\nminiature; and it is treasured by his most illustrious Excellency as\\na rare thing, as indeed it is.\\nBaccio was beloved in Florence for his virtues, for he was assiduous\\nin his work, quiet and good by nature, and a truly God-fearing man;\\nhe had a great liking for a life of peace, and he shunned vicious\\ncompany, delighted much in hearing sermons, and always sought the\\nsociety of learned and serious persons. And in truth, it is seldom\\nthat nature creates a man of good parts and a gentle craftsman,\\nwithout also providing him, after some time, with peace and favour,\\nas she did for Baccio, who, as will be told below, obtained all that\\nhe desired. The report having spread abroad that he was no less good\\nthan able, his fame so increased that he was commissioned by Gerozzo\\ndi Monna Venna Dini to paint the chapel wherein the bones of the\\ndead are kept, in the cemetery of the Hospital of S. Maria Nuova.\\nThere he began a Judgment in fresco, which he executed with such\\ndiligence and beauty of manner in the part which he finished, that\\nhe acquired extraordinary fame thereby, in addition to what he had\\nalready, and became greatly celebrated, on account of his having\\nrepresented with excellent conceptions the Glory of Paradise, and\\nChrist with the twelve Apostles judging the twelve Tribes, wherein\\nthe figures are soft in colouring and most beautifully draped.\\nMoreover, in those figures that are being dragged to Hell, in the\\npart that was designed but left unfinished, one sees the despair,\\ngrief, and shame of everlasting death, even as one perceives\\ncontentment and gladness in those that are being saved; although\\nthis work remained unfinished, since Baccio was inclined to give his\\nattention more to religion than to painting. For there was living in\\nS. Marco, at this time, Fra Girolamo Savonarola of Ferrara, of the\\nOrder of Preaching Friars, a very famous theologian; and Baccio,\\ngoing continually to hear his preaching, on account of the devotion\\nthat he felt for him, contracted a very strait intimacy with him,\\nand passed almost all his time in the convent, having also become\\nthe friend of the other friars. Now it happened that Fra Girolamo,\\ncontinuing his preaching, and crying out every day from the pulpit\\nthat lascivious pictures, music, and amorous books often lead the\\nmind to evil, became convinced that it was not right to keep in\\nhouses where there were young girls painted figures of naked men and\\nwomen. And at the next Carnival--when it was the custom in the city\\nto make little huts of faggots and other kinds of wood on the public\\nsquares, and on the Tuesday evening, according to ancient use, to\\nburn these, with amorous dances, in which men and women, joining\\nhands, danced round these fires, singing certain airs--the people\\nwere so inflamed by Fra Girolamo, and he wrought upon them so\\nstrongly with his words, that on that day they brought to the place\\na vast quantity of nude figures, both in painting and in sculpture,\\nmany by the hand of excellent masters, and likewise books, lutes,\\nand volumes of songs, which was a most grievous loss, particularly\\nfor painting. Thither Baccio carried all the drawings of nudes that\\nhe had made by way of studies, and he was followed by Lorenzo di\\nCredi and by many others, who had the name of Piagnoni. And it was\\nnot long before Baccio, on account of the affection that he bore to\\nFra Girolamo, made a very beautiful portrait of him in a picture,\\nwhich was then taken to Ferrara; but not long ago it came back to\\nFlorence, and it is now in the house of Filippo di Alamanno\\nSalviati, who, since it is by the hand of Baccio, holds it very\\ndear.\\nIt happened, after this, that one day the opponents of Fra Girolamo\\nrose against him, in order to take him and deliver him over to the\\nhands of justice, on account of the disturbances that he had caused\\nin the city; and his friends, seeing this, also banded themselves\\ntogether, to the number of more than five hundred, and shut\\nthemselves up in S. Marco, and Baccio with them, on account of the\\ngreat affection that he had for their party. It is true that, being\\na person of little courage, nay, even timorous and mean-spirited,\\nand hearing an attack being made a little time after this on the\\nconvent, and men being wounded and killed, he began to have serious\\ndoubts about himself. For which reason he made a vow that if he were\\nto escape from that turmoil, he would straightway assume the habit\\nof that Order; which vow he carried out afterwards most faithfully,\\nfor when the uproar had ceased, and Fra Girolamo had been taken and\\ncondemned to death, as the writers of history relate with more\\ndetail, Baccio betook himself to Prato and became a monk in S.\\nDomenico, in that city, on July 26, in the year 1500, as is found\\nwritten in the chronicles of that same convent in which he assumed\\nthe habit; to the great displeasure of all his friends, who were\\ngrieved beyond measure at having lost him, and particularly because\\nthey heard that he had taken it into his head to forsake his\\npainting.\\nWhereupon Mariotto Albertinelli, his friend and companion, at the\\nentreaties of Gerozzo Dini, took over the materials of Fra\\nBartolommeo--which was the name given by the Prior to Baccio, on\\ninvesting him with the habit--and brought to completion the work of\\nthe Ossa in S. Maria Nuova; where he portrayed from life the\\nDirector of the Hospital at that time, and some friars skilled in\\nsurgery, with Gerozzo, the patron of the work, and his wife,\\nfull-length figures on their knees, upon the walls on either side;\\nand in a nude figure that is seated, he portrayed Giuliano\\nBugiardini, his pupil, as a young man, with long locks according to\\nthe custom of that time, in which each separate hair might be\\ncounted, so carefully are they painted. He made there, likewise, his\\nown portrait, in the head, with long locks, of a figure that is\\nissuing from one of the tombs; and in that work, in the region of\\nthe blessed, there is also the portrait of Fra Giovanni da Fiesole,\\nthe painter, whose Life we have written. This painting was executed\\nwholly in fresco, both by Fra Bartolommeo and by Mariotto, so that\\nit has remained, and still remains, marvellously fresh, and is held\\nin esteem by craftsmen, since it is scarcely possible to do better\\nin that kind of work.\\nWhen Fra Bartolommeo had been many months in Prato, he was sent by\\nhis superiors to take up his abode in S. Marco at Florence, and on\\naccount of his virtues he was received very warmly by the friars of\\nthat convent. In those days Bernardo del Bianco had caused to be\\nerected, in the Badia of Florence, a chapel of grey-stone, full of\\ncarving, and very rich and beautiful, from the design of Benedetto\\nda Rovezzano: which chapel was and still is much esteemed on account\\nof some ornamental work of great variety, wherein Benedetto Buglioni\\nplaced, in some niches, angels and other figures made of glazed\\nterra-cotta, in the round, to adorn it the more, with friezes\\ncontaining cherubs and the devices of Bianco. And Bernardo, wishing\\nto set up in the chapel a panel-picture that should be worthy of\\nthat adornment, and conceiving the idea that Fra Bartolommeo would\\nbe the right man for the work, sought in every possible way, through\\nthe intervention of his friends, to persuade him. Fra Bartolommeo\\nwas living in his convent, giving his attention to nothing save the\\ndivine offices and the duties of his Rule, although often besought\\nby the Prior and by his dearest friends that he should work again at\\nhis painting; and for more than four years he had refused to touch a\\nbrush. But on this occasion, being pressed by Bernardo del Bianco,\\nat length he began the panel-picture of S. Bernard, in which the\\nSaint is writing, and gazing with such deep contemplation at the\\nMadonna, with the Child in her arms, being borne by many angels and\\nchildren, all coloured with great delicacy, that there is clearly\\nperceived in him a certain celestial quality, I know not what, which\\nseems, to him who studies it with attention, to shine out over that\\nwork, into which Baccio put much diligence and love; not to mention\\nan arch executed in fresco, which is above it. He also made some\\npictures for Cardinal Giovanni de' Medici; and for Agnolo Doni he\\npainted a picture of Our Lady, which stands on the altar of a chapel\\nin his house--a work of extraordinary beauty.\\nAt this time the painter Raffaello da Urbino came to Florence to\\nstudy his art, and taught the best principles of perspective to Fra\\nBartolommeo; and desiring to acquire the friar's manner of\\ncolouring, and being pleased with his handling of colours and his\\nmethod of harmonizing them, Raffaello was always in his company.\\nFra Bartolommeo painted about the same time, in S. Marco at\\nFlorence, a panel with an infinite number of figures, which is now\\nin the possession of the King of France, having been presented to\\nhim after being exposed to view for many months in S. Marco.\\nAfterwards, he painted another in that convent, containing an\\nendless number of figures, in place of the one that was sent into\\nFrance; in which picture are some children who are flying in the air\\nand holding open a canopy, executed with such good drawing and art,\\nand with such strong relief, that they appear to stand out from the\\npanel, while the colouring of the flesh reveals that beauty and\\nexcellence which every able craftsman seeks to give to his pictures;\\nand this work is still considered at the present day to be most\\nexcellent. In it are many figures surrounding a Madonna, all most\\nadmirable, and executed with grace, feeling, boldness, spirit, and\\nvivacity; and coloured, moreover, in so striking a manner, that they\\nseem to be in relief, since he wished to show that he was able not\\nonly to draw, but also to give his figures force and make them stand\\nout by means of the darkness of the shadows, as may be seen in some\\nchildren who are round a canopy, upholding it, who, as they fly\\nthrough the air, almost project from the panel. Besides this, there\\nis an Infant Christ who is marrying S. Catherine the Nun, than which\\nit would not be possible to paint anything more lifelike with the\\ndark colouring that he used. There is a circle of saints on one side\\ndiminishing in perspective, round the depth of a great recess, who\\nare distributed with such fine design that they seem to be real; and\\nthe same may be seen on the other side. And in truth, in this manner\\nof colouring, he imitated to a great extent the works of Leonardo;\\nparticularly in the darks, for which he used printer's smoke-black\\nand the black of burnt ivory. This panel has now become much darker\\nthan it was when he painted it, on account of those blacks, which\\nhave kept growing heavier and darker. In the foreground, among the\\nprincipal figures, he made a S. George in armour, who has a standard\\nin his hand, a bold, spirited, and vivacious figure, in a beautiful\\nattitude. There is also a S. Bartholomew, standing, a figure that\\ndeserves the highest praise; with two children who are playing, one\\non a lute, and the other on a lyre, one of whom he made with a leg\\ndrawn up and his instrument resting upon it, and with the hands\\ntouching the strings in the act of running over them, an ear intent\\non the harmony, the head upraised, and the mouth slightly open, in\\nsuch a way that whoever beholds him cannot persuade himself that he\\nshould not also hear the voice. No less lifelike is the other, who,\\nleaning on one side, and bending over with one ear to the lyre,\\nappears to be listening to learn how far it is in accord with the\\nsound of the lute and the voice, while, with his eyes fixed on the\\nground, and his ear turned intently towards his companion, who is\\nplaying and singing, he seeks to follow in harmony with the air.\\nThese conceptions and expressions are truly ingenious; the children,\\nwho are seated, and clothed in veiling, are marvellous and executed\\nwith great industry by the practised hand of Fra Bartolommeo; and\\nthe whole work is brought out into strong relief by a fine gradation\\nof dark shadows.\\nA little time afterwards he painted another panel, to stand opposite\\nto the former, and containing a Madonna surrounded by some saints,\\nwhich is held to be a good work. He won extraordinary praise for\\nhaving introduced a method of blending the colouring of his figures\\nin such a way as to add a marvellous degree of harmony to art,\\nmaking them appear to be in relief and alive, and executing them\\nwith supreme perfection of manner.\\nHearing much of the noble works made in Rome by Michelagnolo, and\\nlikewise those of the gracious Raffaello, and being roused by the\\nfame, which was continually reaching him, of the marvels wrought by\\nthose two divine craftsmen, with leave from his Prior he betook\\nhimself to Rome. There he was entertained by Fra Mariano Fetti,\\nFriar of the Piombo, for whom he painted two pictures of S. Peter\\nand S. Paul at his Convent of S. Silvestro a Monte Cavallo. But\\nsince he did not succeed in working as well in the air of Rome as he\\nhad done in that of Florence, while the vast number of works that he\\nsaw, what with the ancient and the modern, bewildered him so that\\nmuch of the ability and excellence that he believed himself to\\npossess, fell away from him, he determined to depart, leaving to\\nRaffaello the charge of finishing one of those pictures, that of S.\\nPeter, which he had not completed; which picture was retouched all\\nover by the hand of the marvellous Raffaello, and given to Fra\\nMariano.\\nThus, then, Fra Bartolommeo returned to Florence. There he had been\\naccused many times of not knowing how to paint nudes; for which\\nreason he resolved to put himself to the test, and to show by means\\nof his labour that he was as well fitted as any other master for the\\nhighest achievements of his art. Whereupon, to prove this, he\\npainted a picture of S. Sebastian, naked, very lifelike in the\\ncolouring of the flesh, sweet in countenance, and likewise executed\\nwith corresponding beauty of person, whereby he won infinite praise\\nfrom the craftsmen. It is said that, while this figure was exposed\\nto view in the church, the friars found, through the confessional,\\nwomen who had sinned at the sight of it, on account of the charm and\\nmelting beauty of the lifelike reality imparted to it by the genius\\nof Fra Bartolommeo; for which reason they removed it from the church\\nand placed it in the chapter-house, where it did not remain long\\nbefore it was bought by Giovan Battista della Palla and sent to the\\nKing of France.\\nFra Bartolommeo had fallen into a rage against the joiners who made\\nthe ornamental frames for his panels and pictures, for it was their\\ncustom, as it still is at the present day, always to cover an eighth\\npart of the figures with the projecting inner edges of the frames.\\nHe determined, therefore, to invent some means of doing without\\nframes for panels; and for this S. Sebastian he caused the panel to\\nbe made in the form of a half-circle, wherein he drew a niche in\\nperspective, which has the appearance of being carved in relief in\\nthe panel. Thus, painting a frame all round, he made an ornament for\\nthe figure in the middle; and he did the same for our S. Vincent,\\nand for the S. Mark that will be described after the S. Vincent. For\\nthe arch of a door leading into the sacristy, he painted in oils, on\\nwood, a figure of S. Vincent, a brother of that Order, representing\\nhim in the act of preaching on the Judgment, so that there may be\\nperceived in his gestures, and particularly in his head, that\\nvehemence and fury which are generally seen in the faces of\\npreachers, when they are doing their utmost, with threats of the\\nvengeance of God, to lead men hardened in sin into the perfect life;\\nin such a manner that this figure appears, to one who studies it\\nwith attention, to be not painted but real and alive, with such\\nstrong relief is it executed; and it is a pity that it is all\\ncracking and spoiling, on account of its having been painted with\\nfresh coats of colour on fresh size, as I said of the works of\\nPietro Perugino in the Convent of the Ingesuati.\\nThe fancy took him, in order to show that he was able to make large\\nfigures--for he had been told that his manner was that of a\\nminiaturist--to paint on panel, for the wall in which is the door of\\nthe choir, a figure of S. Mark the Evangelist, five braccia in\\nheight, and executed with very good draughtsmanship and supreme\\nexcellence.\\nAfter this, Salvadore Billi, a Florentine merchant, on his return\\nfrom Naples, having heard the fame of Fra Bartolommeo, and having\\nseen his works, caused him to paint a panel-picture of Christ the\\nSaviour, in allusion to his own name, with the four Evangelists\\nround Him; wherein, at the foot, are also two little boys upholding\\nthe globe of the world, whose flesh, fresh and tender, is\\nexcellently painted, as is the whole work, in which there are\\nlikewise two prophets that are much extolled. This panel stands in\\nthe Nunziata at Florence, below the great organ, according to the\\nwish of Salvadore; it is a very beautiful work, finished by Fra\\nBartolommeo with much lovingness and great perfection; and it is\\nsurrounded by an ornament of marble, all carved by the hand of\\nPietro Rosselli.\\nAfterwards, having need of a change of air, the Prior at that time,\\nwho was his friend, sent him away to a monastery of his Order,\\nwherein, while he stayed there, he combined the labour of his hands\\nwith the contemplation of death, with profit both for his soul\\nand for the convent. For S. Martino in Lucca he painted a panel\\nwherein, at the feet of a Madonna, there is a little angel playing\\non a lute, together with S. Stephen and S. John; in which picture,\\nexecuted with excellent draughtsmanship and colouring, he proved his\\nability. For S. Romano, likewise, he painted a panel on canvas of\\nthe Madonna della Misericordia, who is placed on a pedestal of\\nstone, with some angels holding her mantle; and together with her\\nhe depicted a throng of people on some steps, some standing, others\\nseated, and others kneeling, but all gazing at a figure of Christ on\\nhigh, who is sending down lightnings and thunderbolts upon the\\npeople. Clearly did Fra Bartolommeo prove in this work how well he\\nwas able to manage the gradation of shadows and darks in painting,\\ngiving extraordinary relief to his figures, and showing a rare and\\nexcellent mastery over the difficulties of his art in colouring,\\ndrawing, and invention; and the work is as perfect as any that he\\never made. For the same church he painted another panel, also on\\ncanvas, containing a Christ and S. Catherine the Martyr, together\\nwith a S. Catherine of Siena, rapt in ecstasy from the earth, a\\nfigure as good as any that could possibly be painted in that manner.\\nReturning to Florence, he gave some attention to the study of music;\\nand, delighting much therein, he would sometimes sing to pass the\\ntime. At Prato, opposite to the prison, he painted a panel-picture\\nof the Assumption. He executed some pictures of Our Lady for the\\nhouse of the Medici, and also other paintings for various people,\\nsuch as a picture of Our Lady which Lodovico di Lodovico Capponi has\\nin his apartment, and likewise another of the Virgin holding the\\nChild in her arms, with two heads of saints, that is in the\\npossession of the very Excellent Messer Lelio Torelli, Chief\\nSecretary to the most Illustrious Duke Cosimo, who holds it very\\ndear both on account of the genius of Fra Bartolommeo, and because\\nhe delights in, loves, and favours not only the men of our art, but\\nevery fine intellect. In the house of Piero del Pugliese, which now\\nbelongs to Matteo Botti, a citizen and merchant of Florence, in an\\nantechamber at the head of a staircase, he painted a S. George in\\narmour, on horseback, who is slaying the Dragon with his lance--a\\nvery spirited figure. This he executed in chiaroscuro, in oils, a\\nmethod that he much delighted to use for all his works, sketching\\nthem in the manner of a cartoon, with ink or with bitumen, before\\ncolouring them; as may still be seen from many beginnings of\\npictures and panels, which he left unfinished on account of his\\ndeath, and as may also be perceived from many drawings by his hand,\\nexecuted in chiaroscuro, of which the greater part are now in the\\nMonastery of S. Caterina da Siena on the Piazza di S. Marco, in\\nthe possession of a nun who paints, and of whom record will be made\\nin the proper place; while many made in the same way adorn our book\\nof drawings, honouring his memory, and some are in the hands of\\nMesser Francesco del Garbo, a most excellent physician.\\nFra Bartolommeo always liked to have living objects before him when\\nhe was working; and in order to be able to draw draperies, armour,\\nand other suchlike things, he caused a life-size figure of wood to be\\nmade, which moved at the joints; and this he clothed with real\\ndraperies, from which he painted most beautiful things, being able\\nto keep them in position as long as he pleased, until he had brought\\nhis work to perfection. This figure, worm-eaten and ruined as it is,\\nis in our possession, treasured in memory of him.\\nAt Arezzo, for the Abbey of the Black Friars, he made a head of\\nChrist in dark tints--a very beautiful work. He painted, also, the\\npanel of the Company of the Contemplanti, which was preserved in the\\nhouse of the Magnificent Messer Ottaviano de' Medici, and has now\\nbeen placed in a chapel of that house, with many ornaments, by his\\nson Messer Alessandro, who holds it very dear in memory of Fra\\nBartolommeo, and also because he takes vast pleasure in painting. In\\nthe chapel of the Noviciate of S. Marco there is a panel-picture of\\nthe Purification, very lovely, which he executed with good\\ndraughtsmanship and high finish. At S. Maria Maddalena, a seat of\\nthe Friars of his Order, without Florence, while staying there for\\nhis own pleasure, he made a Christ and a Magdalene; and he also\\npainted certain things in fresco in that convent. In like manner, he\\nwrought in fresco an arch over the strangers' apartment in S. Marco,\\nin which he painted Christ with Cleophas and Luke, and made a\\nportrait of Fra Niccolò della Magna, who was then a young man, and\\nwho afterwards became Archbishop of Capua, and finally a Cardinal.\\nHe began a panel for S. Gallo, afterwards finished by Giuliano\\nBugiardini, which is now on the high-altar of S. Jacopo fra Fossi,\\non the Canto degli Alberti; and likewise a picture of the Rape of\\nDinah, now in the possession of Messer Cristofano Rinieri, and\\nafterwards coloured by the same Giuliano, in which are buildings and\\nconceptions that are much extolled.\\nFrom Piero Soderini he received the commission for the panel of the\\nCouncil Chamber, which he began in such a manner, drawing it in\\nchiaroscuro, that it seemed destined to do him very great credit;\\nand, unfinished as it is, it now has a place of honour in the Chapel\\nof the Magnificent Ottaviano de' Medici, in S. Lorenzo. In it are\\nall the Patron Saints of the city of Florence, and those saints on\\nwhose days that city has gained her victories; and there is also the\\nportrait of Fra Bartolommeo himself, made by him with a mirror. He\\nhad begun this picture, and had drawn the whole design, when it\\nhappened that, from working continually under a window, with the\\nlight from it beating on his back, he became completely paralyzed on\\nthat side of his body, and quite unable to move. Thereupon he was\\nadvised--such being the orders of his physicians--to go to the baths\\nof San Filippo; where he stayed a long time, but became very little\\nbetter thereby. Now Fra Bartolommeo was a great lover of fruit,\\nwhich pleased his palate mightily, although it was ruinous to his\\nhealth. Wherefore one morning, having eaten many figs, there came\\nupon him, in addition to his other infirmity, a very violent fever,\\nwhich cut short the course of his life in four days, at the age of\\nforty-eight; when, still wholly conscious, he rendered up his soul\\nto Heaven.\\nHis death grieved his friends, and particularly the friars, who gave\\nhim honourable sepulture in their burial-place in S. Marco, on\\nOctober 8, in the year 1517. He had a dispensation from attending\\nany of the offices in the choir with the other friars, and the gains\\nfrom his works went to the convent, enough money being left in his\\nhands to pay for colours and other materials necessary for his\\npainting.\\nHe left disciples in Cecchino del Frate, Benedetto Cianfanini,\\nGabriele Rustici, and Fra Paolo Pistoiese, the latter inheriting all\\nhis possessions. This Fra Paolo painted many panels and pictures\\nfrom his master's drawings, after his death; of which three are in\\nS. Domenico at Pistoia, and one at S. Maria del Sasso in the\\nCasentino.\\nFra Bartolommeo gave such grace to his figures with his colouring,\\nand made them so novel and so modern in manner, that for these\\nreasons he deserves to be numbered by us among the benefactors of\\nart.\", \"MARIOTTO ALBERTINELLI\\nPAINTER OF FLORENCE\\nMariotto Albertinelli, the closest and most intimate friend of Fra\\nBartolommeo--his other self, one might call him, not only on account\\nof the constant connection and intercourse between them, but also\\nthrough their similarity of manner during the period when Mariotto\\ngave proper attention to art--was the son of Biagio di Bindo\\nAlbertinelli. At the age of twenty he abandoned his calling of\\ngold-beater, in which he had been employed up to that time; and he\\nlearnt the first rudiments of painting in the workshop of Cosimo\\nRosselli, where he formed such an intimacy with Baccio della Porta,\\nthat they were one soul and one body. Such, indeed, was the\\nbrotherly friendship between them, that when Baccio took his leave\\nof Cosimo, in order to practise his art as a master by himself,\\nMariotto went off with him; whereupon they lived for a long time,\\nboth one and the other, at the Porta a S. Piero Gattolini, executing\\nmany works in company. And since Mariotto was not so well grounded\\nin drawing as was Baccio, he devoted himself to the study of such\\nantiquities as were then in Florence, the greater part and the best\\nof which were in the house of the Medici. He made a number of\\ndrawings of certain little panels in half-relief that were under the\\nloggia in the garden, on the side towards S. Lorenzo, in one of\\nwhich is Adonis with a very beautiful dog, and in another two nude\\nfigures, one seated, with a dog at its feet, and the other standing\\nwith the legs crossed, leaning on a staff. Both these panels are\\nmarvellous; and there are likewise two others of the same size, in\\none of which are two little boys carrying Jove's thunderbolt, while\\nin the other is the nude figure of an old man, with wings on his\\nshoulders and feet, representing Chance, and balancing a pair of\\nscales in his hands. In addition to these works, that garden was\\nfull of torsi of men and women, which were a school not only for\\nMariotto, but for all the sculptors and painters of his time. A good\\npart of these are now in the guardaroba of Duke Cosimo, and others,\\nsuch as the two torsi of Marsyas, the heads over the windows, and\\nthose of the Emperors over the doors, are still in the same place.\\nBy studying these antiquities, Mariotto made great proficience in\\ndrawing; and he entered into the service of the mother of Duke\\nLorenzo, Madonna Alfonsina, who, desiring that he should devote\\nhimself to becoming an able master, offered him all possible\\nassistance. Dividing his time, therefore, between drawing and\\ncolouring, he became a passing good craftsman, as is proved by some\\npictures that he executed for that lady, which were sent by her to\\nRome, for Carlo and Giordano Orsini, and which afterwards came into\\nthe hands of Cæsar Borgia. He made a very good portrait of Madonna\\nAlfonsina from the life; and it seemed to him, on account of his\\nfriendship with her, that his fortune was made, when, in the year\\n1494, Piero de' Medici was banished, and her assistance and favour\\nfailed him. Whereupon he returned to the workshop of Baccio, where\\nhe set himself with even greater zeal to make models of clay and to\\nincrease his knowledge, labouring at the study of nature, and\\nimitating the works of Baccio, so that in a few years he became a\\nsound and practised master. And then, seeing his work succeeding so\\nwell, he so grew in courage, that, imitating the manner and method\\nof his companion, the hand of Mariotto was taken by many for that of\\nFra Bartolommeo.\\nBut when he heard that Baccio had gone off to become a monk,\\nMariotto was almost overwhelmed and out of his mind; and so strange\\ndid the news seem to him, that he was in despair, and nothing could\\ncheer him. If it had not been, indeed, that Mariotto could not then\\nendure having anything to do with monks, against whom he was ever\\nrailing, and belonged to the party that was opposed to the faction\\nof Fra Girolamo of Ferrara, his love for Baccio would have wrought\\nupon him so strongly, that it would have forced him to don the cowl\\nin the same convent as his companion. However, he was besought by\\nGerozzo Dini, who had given the commission for the Judgment that\\nBaccio had left unfinished in the Ossa, that he, having a manner\\nsimilar to Baccio's, should undertake to finish it; whereupon, being\\nalso moved by the circumstance that the cartoon completed by the\\nhand of Baccio and other drawings were there, and by the entreaties\\nof Fra Bartolommeo himself, who had received money on account of the\\npainting, and was troubled in conscience at not having kept his\\npromise, he finished the work, and executed all that was wanting\\nwith diligence and love, in such a way that many, not knowing this,\\nthink that it was painted by one single hand; and this brought him\\nvast credit among craftsmen.\\nIn the Chapter-house of the Certosa of Florence he executed a\\nCrucifixion, with Our Lady and the Magdalene at the foot of the\\nCross, and some angels in the sky, who are receiving the blood of\\nChrist; a work wrought in fresco, with diligence and lovingness, and\\npassing well painted. Now some of the young men who were learning\\nart under him, thinking that the friars were not giving them proper\\nfood, had counterfeited, without the knowledge of Mariotto, the keys\\nof those windows opening into the friar's rooms, through which their\\npittance is passed; and sometimes, in secret, they stole some of it,\\nnow from one and now from another. There was a great uproar about\\nthis among the friars, since in the matter of eating they are as\\nsensitive as any other person; but the lads did it with great\\ndexterity, and, since they were held to be honest fellows, the blame\\nfell on some of the friars, who were said to be doing it from hatred\\nof one another. However, one day the truth was revealed, and the\\nfriars, to the end that the work might be finished, gave a double\\nallowance to Mariotto and his lads, who finished the work with great\\nglee and laughter.\\nFor the Nuns of S. Giuliano in Florence he painted the panel of\\ntheir high-altar, which he executed in a room that he had in the\\nGualfonda; together with another for the same church, with a\\nCrucifix, some Angels, and God the Father, representing the Trinity,\\nin oils and on a gold ground.\\nMariotto was a most restless person, devoted to the pleasures of\\nlove, and a good liver in the matter of eating; wherefore,\\nconceiving a hatred for the subtleties and brain-rackings of\\npainting, and being often wounded by the tongues of other painters\\n(according to the undying custom among them, handed down from one to\\nanother), he resolved to turn to a more humble, less fatiguing, and\\nmore cheerful art. And so, having opened a very fine inn, without\\nthe Porta S. Gallo, and a tavern and inn on the Ponte Vecchio, at\\nthe Dragon, he followed that calling for many months, saying that he\\nhad chosen an art without foreshortenings, muscles, and\\nperspectives, and, what was much more important, free from censure,\\nand that the art which he had given up was quite the contrary of his\\nnew one, since the former imitated flesh and blood, and the latter\\nmade both blood and flesh; and now, having good wine, he heard\\nhimself praised all day long, whereas before he used to hear nothing\\nbut censure.\\nHowever, having grown weary of this as well, and ashamed of the\\nbaseness of his calling, he returned to painting, and executed\\npictures and paintings for the houses of citizens in Florence. For\\nGiovan Maria Benintendi he painted three little scenes with his own\\nhand; and for the house of the Medici, at the election of Leo X, he\\npainted a round picture of his arms, in oils, with Faith, Hope, and\\nCharity, which hung for a long time over the door of their palace.\\nHe undertook to make, in the Company of S. Zanobi, near the\\nChapter-house of S. Maria del Fiore, a panel-picture of the\\nAnnunciation, which he executed with great labour. For this he\\ncaused special windows to be made, wishing to work on the spot, in\\norder to be able to make the views recede, where they were high and\\ndistant, by lowering the tones, or to bring them forward, at his\\npleasure. Now he had conceived the idea that pictures which have no\\nrelief and force, combined with delicacy, are of no account; but\\nsince he knew that they cannot be made to stand out from the surface\\nwithout shadows, which, if they are too dark, remain indistinct,\\nwhile, if they are delicate, they have no force, he was eager to\\ncombine this delicacy with a certain method of treatment to which up\\nto that time, so it seemed to him, art had not attained in any\\nsatisfactory manner. Wherefore, looking on this work as an\\nopportunity for accomplishing this, he set himself, to this end, to\\nmake extraordinary efforts, which may be recognized in a figure\\nof God the Father, which is in the sky, and in some little children,\\nwho stand out from the panel in strong relief against a dark\\nbackground in perspective that he made there with a ceiling in the\\nform of a barrel-shaped vault, which, with its arches curving and\\nits lines diminishing to a point, recedes inwards in such a manner\\nthat it appears to be in relief; besides which, there are some\\nangels scattering flowers as they fly, that are very graceful.\\nThis work was painted out and painted in again many times by\\nMariotto before he could bring it to completion. He was for ever\\nchanging the colouring, making it now lighter, now darker, and\\nsometimes more lively and glowing, sometimes less; but, never being\\ncompletely satisfied, and never persuaded that he had done justice\\nwith his hand to the thoughts of his intellect, he wished to find a\\nwhite that should be more brilliant than lead-white, and set\\nhimself, therefore, to clarify the latter, in order to be able to\\nheighten the highest light to his own satisfaction. However, having\\nrecognized that he was not able to express by means of art all that\\nthe intelligence of the human brain grasps and comprehends, he\\ncontented himself with what he had achieved, since he could not\\nattain to what it was not possible to reach. This work brought\\nMariotto praise and honour among craftsmen, but by no means as much\\nprofit as he hoped to gain from his patrons in return for his\\nlabours, since a dispute arose between him and those who had\\ncommissioned him to paint it. But Pietro Perugino, then an old man,\\nRidolfo Ghirlandajo, and Francesco Granacci valued it, and settled\\nthe price of the work by common consent.\\nFor S. Pancrazio, in Florence, Mariotto painted a semicircular\\npicture of the Visitation of Our Lady. For S. Trinità, likewise, he\\nexecuted with diligence a panel-picture of Our Lady, S. Jerome, and\\nS. Zanobi, at the commission of Zanobi del Maestro; and for the\\nChurch of the Congregation of the Priests of S. Martino, he painted\\na picture on panel of the Visitation, which is much extolled. He was\\ninvited to the Convent of La Quercia, without Viterbo; but after\\nhaving begun a panel there, he conceived a desire to see Rome.\\nHaving made his way to that city, therefore, he executed to\\nperfection for the Chapel of Fra Mariano Fetti in S. Silvestro di\\nMonte Cavallo, a panel-picture in oils of S. Dominic, S. Catherine\\nof Siena, with Christ marrying her, and Our Lady, in a delicate\\nmanner. He then returned to La Quercia, where he had a mistress, to\\nwhom, on account of the desire that he had felt while he was in Rome\\nand could not enjoy her love, he sought to show that he was valiant\\nin the lists; wherefore he exerted himself so much, that, being no\\nlonger young and so stalwart in such efforts, he was forced to take\\nto his bed. And laying the blame for this on the air of the place,\\nhe had himself carried to Florence in a litter; but no expedients or\\nremedies availed him in his sickness, from which he died in a few\\ndays, at the age of forty-five. He was buried in S. Piero Maggiore,\\nin that city.\\nThere are some drawings by the hand of this master in our book,\\nexecuted with the pen and in chiaroscuro, which are very good;\\nparticularly a spiral staircase, drawn with great ingenuity in\\nperspective, of which he had a good knowledge.\\nMariotto had many disciples; among others, Giuliano Bugiardini and\\nFranciabigio, both Florentines, and Innocenzio da Imola, of whom we\\nwill speak in the proper place. Visino, a painter of Florence, was\\nlikewise his disciple, and excelled all these others in drawing,\\ncolouring, and industry, showing, also, a better manner in the works\\nthat he made, which he executed with great diligence. A few of them\\nare still in Florence; and one can study his work at the present day\\nin the house of Giovan Battista d' Agnol Doni, in a mirror--picture\\npainted in oils after the manner of a miniature, wherein are Adam and\\nEve naked, eating the apple, a work executed with great care; and from\\nanother picture, of Christ being taken down from the Cross, together\\nwith the Thieves, in which there is a beautifully contrived\\ncomplication of ladders, with some men aiding each other to take down\\nthe body of Christ, and others bearing one of the Thieves on their\\nshoulders to burial, and all the figures in varied and fantastic\\nattitudes, suited to that subject, and proving that he was an able\\nman. The same master was brought by some Florentine merchants to\\nHungary, where he executed many works and gained great renown. But the\\npoor man was soon in danger of coming to an evil end, because, being\\nof a frank and free-spoken nature, he was not able to endure the\\nwearisome persistence of some Hungarians, who kept tormenting him all\\nday long with praises of their own country, as if there were no\\npleasure or happiness in anything except eating and drinking in their\\nstifling rooms, and no grandeur or nobility save in their King and his\\nCourt, all the rest of the world being rubbish. It seemed to him (and\\nindeed it is true) that in Italy there was another kind of excellence,\\nculture, and beauty; and one day, being weary of their nonsense, and\\nchancing to be a little merry, he let slip the opinion that a flask of\\nTrebbiano and a berlingozzo were worth all the Kings and Queens\\nthat had ever reigned in those regions. And if the matter had not\\nhappened to fall into the hands of a Bishop, who was a gentleman and a\\nman of the world, and also, above all, a tactful person, both able and\\nwilling to turn the thing into a joke, Visino would have learnt not to\\nplay with savages; for those brutes of Hungarians, not understanding\\nhis words, and thinking that he had uttered something terrible, such\\nas a threat that he would rob their King of his life and throne,\\nwished to give him short shrift and crucify him by mob-law. But the\\ngood Bishop drew him out of all embarrassment, and, appraising the\\nmerit of the excellent master at its true value, and putting a good\\ncomplexion on the affair, restored him to the favour of the King, who,\\non hearing the story, was much amused by it. His good fortune,\\nhowever, did not last long, for, not being able to endure the stifling\\nrooms and the cold air, which ruined his constitution, in a short time\\nthis brought his life to an end; although his repute and fame survived\\nin the memory of those who knew him when alive, and of those who saw\\nhis works in the years after his death. His pictures date about the\\nyear 1512.\\nMuseum. The subject of this picture, which the translator was\\nenabled to see by the courtesy of Mr. B. S. Long, of the Department\\nof Paintings, is the same as that of the work mentioned by Vasari,\\nand it may be a copy.\\n Florentine puff-pastry.\", \"RAFFAELLINO DEL GARBO\\nPAINTER OF FLORENCE\\nRaffaello del Garbo, while he was a little boy, was called by the pet\\nname of Raffaellino, which he retained ever afterwards; and in his\\nearliest days he gave such promise in his art, that he was already\\nnumbered among the most excellent masters, a thing which happens to\\nfew. But still fewer meet the fate which afterwards came upon him,\\nin that from a splendid beginning and almost certain hopes, he\\narrived at a very feeble end. For it is a general rule, in the world\\nboth of nature and of art, for things to grow gradually from small\\nbeginnings, little by little, until they reach their highest\\nperfection. It is true, however, that many laws both of art and of\\nnature are unknown to us, nor do they hold to one unvarying order at\\nall times and in every case, a thing which very often renders\\nuncertain the judgments of men. How this may happen is seen in\\nRaffaellino, since it appeared that in him nature and art did their\\nutmost to set out from extraordinary beginnings, the middle stage of\\nwhich was below mediocrity, and the end almost nothing.\\nIn his youth he drew as much as any painter who has ever exercised\\nhimself in drawing in order to become perfect; wherefore there may\\nstill be seen, throughout the world of art, a great number of his\\ndrawings, which have been dispersed by a son of his for ridiculous\\nprices, partly drawn with the style, partly with the pen or in\\nwater-colours, but all on tinted paper, heightened with lead-white,\\nand executed with marvellous boldness and mastery; and there are\\nmany of them in our book, drawn in a most beautiful manner. Besides\\nthis, he learnt to paint so well in distemper and in fresco, that\\nhis first works were executed with an incredible patience and\\ndiligence, as has been related.\\nIn the Minerva, round the tomb of Cardinal Caraffa, he painted the\\nvaulted ceiling, with such delicacy, that it seems like the work of\\nan illuminator; wherefore it was held in great estimation by\\ncraftsmen at that time. His master, Filippo, regarded him in some\\nrespects as a much better painter than himself; and Raffaellino had\\nacquired Filippo's manner so well, that there were few who could\\ndistinguish the one from the other. Later, after having left his\\nmaster, he gave much more delicacy to that manner in the draperies,\\nand greater softness to hair and to the expressions of the heads;\\nand he was held in such expectation by craftsmen, that, while he\\nfollowed this manner, he was considered the first of the young\\npainters of his day. Now the family of the Capponi, having built a\\nchapel that is called the Paradiso, on the hill below the Church of\\nS. Bartolommeo a Monte Oliveto, without the Porta a S. Friano,\\nwished to have the panel executed by Raffaellino, and gave him the\\ncommission; whereupon he painted in oils the Resurrection of Christ,\\nwith some soldiers who have fallen, as if dead, round the Sepulchre.\\nThese figures are very spirited and beautiful, and they have the\\nmost graceful heads that it is possible to see; among which, in the\\nhead of a young man, is a marvellous portrait of Niccola Capponi,\\nwhile, in like manner, the head of one who is crying out because the\\nstone covering of the tomb has fallen upon him, is most beautiful\\nand bizarre. Wherefore the Capponi, having seen that Raffaellino's\\npicture was a rare work, caused a frame to be made for it, all\\ncarved, with round columns richly adorned with burnished gold on a\\nground of bole. Before many years had passed, the campanile of that\\nbuilding was struck by lightning, which pierced the vault and fell\\nnear that panel, which, having been executed in oils, suffered no\\nharm; but where the fluid passed near the gilt frame, it consumed\\nthe gold, leaving nothing there but the bare bole. It has seemed to\\nme right to say that much with regard to oil-painting, to the end\\nthat all may see how important it is to know how to guard against\\nsuch injury, which lightning has done not only to this work, but to\\nmany others.\\nHe painted in fresco, at the corner of a house that now belongs to\\nMatteo Botti, between the Canto del Ponte alla Carraja and the Canto\\ndella Cuculia, a little shrine containing Our Lady with the Child\\nin her arms, with S. Catherine and S. Barbara kneeling, a very\\ngraceful and carefully executed work. For the Villa of Marignolle,\\nbelonging to the Girolami, he painted two most beautiful panels,\\nwith Our Lady, S. Zanobi, and other saints; and he filled the\\npredella below both of these with little figures representing scenes\\nfrom the lives of those saints, executed with great diligence. On\\nthe wall above the door of the Church of the Nuns of S. Giorgio, he\\npainted a Pietà, with a group of the Maries; and in like manner, in\\nanother arch below this, a figure of Our Lady, a work worthy of\\ngreat praise, executed in the year 1504. In the Church of S. Spirito\\nat Florence, in a panel over that of the Nerli, which his master\\nFilippo had executed, he painted a Pietà, which is held to be a very\\ngood and praiseworthy work; but in another, representing S. Bernard,\\nhe fell short of that standard. Below the door of the sacristy are\\ntwo panel-pictures by his hand; one showing S. Gregory the Pope\\nsaying Mass, when Christ appears to him, naked, with the Cross on\\nHis shoulder, and shedding blood from His side, with the deacon and\\nsub-deacon, in their vestments, serving the Mass, and two angels\\nswinging censers over the body of Christ. For another chapel, lower\\ndown, he executed a panel-picture containing Our Lady, S. Jerome,\\nand S. Bartholomew. On these two works he bestowed no little labour;\\nbut he went on deteriorating from day to day. I do not know to what\\nI should attribute his misfortune, for poor Raffaellino was not\\nwanting in industry, diligence, and application; yet they availed\\nhim little. It is believed, indeed, that, becoming overburdened and\\nimpoverished by the cares of a family, and being compelled to use\\nfor his daily needs whatever he earned, not to mention that he was a\\nman of no great spirit and undertook to do work for small prices, in\\nthis way he went on growing worse little by little; although there\\nis always something of the good to be seen in his works.\\nFor the Monks of Cestello, on the wall of their refectory, he\\npainted a large scene coloured in fresco, in which he depicted the\\nmiracle wrought by Jesus Christ with the five loaves and two fishes,\\nwith which he satisfied five thousand people. For the Abbot de'\\nPanichi he executed the panel-picture of the high-altar in the\\nChurch of S. Salvi, without the Porta alla Croce, painting therein\\nOur Lady, S. Giovanni Gualberto, S. Salvi, S. Bernardo, a Cardinal\\nof the Uberti family, and S. Benedetto the Abbot, and, at the sides,\\nS. Batista and S. Fedele in armour, in two niches on either hand of\\nthe picture, which had a rich frame; and in the predella are several\\nscenes, with little figures, from the Life of S. Giovanni Gualberto.\\nIn all this he acquitted himself very well, because he was assisted\\nin his wretchedness by that Abbot, who took pity on him for the sake\\nof his talents; and in the predella of the panel Raffaellino made a\\nportrait of him from life, together with one of the General who was\\nthen ruling his Order. In S. Piero Maggiore, on the right as one\\nenters the church, there is a panel by his hand, and in the Murate\\nthere is a picture of S. Sigismund, the King. For Girolamo\\nFederighi, in that part of S. Pancrazio where he was afterwards\\nburied, he painted a Trinity in fresco, with portraits of him and of\\nhis wife on their knees; and here he began to decline into pettiness\\nof manner. He also made two figures in distemper for the Monks of\\nCestello, a S. Rocco and a S. Ignazio, which are in the Chapel of S.\\nSebastiano. And in a little chapel on the abutment of the Ponte\\nRubaconte, on the side towards the Mills, he painted a Madonna, a S.\\nLaurence, and another saint.\\nIn the end he was reduced to undertaking any work, however mean; and\\nhe was employed by certain nuns and other persons, who were\\nembroidering a quantity of church vestments and hangings at that\\ntime, to make designs in chiaroscuro and ornamental borders\\ncontaining saints and stories, for ridiculous prices. For although\\nhe had deteriorated, there sometimes issued from his hand most\\nbeautiful designs and fancies, as is proved by many drawings that\\nwere sold and dispersed after the death of those who used them for\\nembroidery; of which there are many in the book of the illustrious\\nhospital-director, that show how able he was in draughtsmanship.\\nThis was the reason that many vestments, hangings, and ornaments,\\nwhich are held to be very beautiful, were made for the churches of\\nFlorence and throughout the Florentine territory, and also for\\nCardinals and Bishops in Rome. At the present day this method of\\nembroidery, which was used by Paolo da Verona, the Florentine\\nGalieno, and others like them, is almost lost, and another method,\\nwith wide stitches, has been introduced, which has neither the same\\nbeauty nor the same careful workmanship, and is much less durable\\nthan the other. Wherefore, in return for this benefit, although\\npoverty caused him misery and hardship during his lifetime, he\\ndeserves to have honour and glory for his talents after his death.\\nAnd in truth Raffaellino was unfortunate in his connections, for he\\nalways mixed with poor and humble people, like a man who had sunk\\nand become ashamed of himself, seeing that in his youth he had given\\nsuch great promise, and now knew how distant he was from the\\nextraordinary excellence of the works that he had made at that time.\\nAnd thus, growing old, he fell away so much from his early standard,\\nthat his works no longer appeared to be by his hand; and forgetting\\nhis art more and more every day, he was reduced to painting, in\\naddition to his usual panels and pictures, the meanest kinds of\\nworks. And he sank so low that everything was a torment to him, but\\nabove all his burdensome family of children, which turned all his\\nability in art into mere clumsiness. Wherefore, being overtaken by\\ninfirmities and impoverished, he finished his life in misery at the\\nage of fifty-eight, and was buried in S. Simone, at Florence, by the\\nCompany of the Misericordia, in the year 1524.\\nHe left behind him many pupils who became able masters. One, who\\nwent in his boyhood to learn the rudiments of art from Raffaellino,\\nwas the Florentine painter Bronzino, who afterwards acquitted\\nhimself so well under the wing of Jacopo da Pontormo, another\\npainter of Florence, that he has made as much proficience in the art\\nas his master Jacopo. The portrait of Raffaellino was copied from a\\ndrawing that belonged to Bastiano da Monte Carlo, who was also his\\ndisciple, and who, for a man with no draughtsmanship, became a\\npassing good master.\", 'TORRIGIANO\\nSCULPTOR OF FLORENCE\\nGreat is the power of anger in the soul of one who is seeking, with\\narrogance and pride, to gain a reputation for excellence in some\\nprofession, when he sees rising in the same art, at a time when he\\ndoes not expect it, some unknown man of beautiful genius, who not\\nonly equals him, but in time surpasses him by a great measure. Of\\nsuch persons, in truth, it may be said that there is no iron that\\nthey would not gnaw in their rage, nor any evil which they would not\\ndo if they were able, for it seems to them too grievous an affront\\nin the eyes of the world, that children whom they saw born should\\nhave reached maturity almost in one bound from their cradles. They\\ndo not reflect that every day one may see the will of young men,\\nspurred on by zeal in their tender years, and exercised by them in\\ncontinual studies, rise to infinite heights; while the old, led by\\nfear, pride, and ambition, lose the cunning of their hands, so that\\nthe better they think to work, the worse they do it, and where they\\nbelieve that they are advancing, they are going backwards.\\nWherefore, out of envy, they never give credit to the young for the\\nperfection of their works, however clearly they may see it, on\\naccount of the obstinacy that possesses them. And it is known from\\nexperience that when, in order to show what they can do, they exert\\nthemselves to the utmost of their power, they often produce works\\nthat are ridiculous and a mere laughing-stock. In truth, when\\ncraftsmen have reached the age when the eye is no longer steady and\\nthe hand trembles, their place, if they have saved the wherewithal\\nto live, is to give advice to men who can work, for the reason that\\nthe arts of painting and sculpture call for a mind in every way\\nvigorous and awake (as it is at the age when the blood is boiling),\\nfull of burning desire, and a capital enemy of the pleasures of the\\nworld. And whoever is not temperate with regard to the delights of\\nthe world should shun the studies of any art or science whatsoever,\\nseeing that such pleasures and study can never agree well together.\\nSince, therefore, these arts involve so many burdens, few, indeed,\\nare they who attain to the highest rank; and those who start with\\neagerness from the post are greater in number than those who run\\nwell in the race and win the prize.\\nNow there was more pride than art, although he was very able, to be\\nseen in Torrigiano, a sculptor of Florence, who in his youth was\\nmaintained by the elder Lorenzo de\\' Medici in the garden which that\\nmagnificent citizen possessed on the Piazza di S. Marco in Florence.\\nThis garden was in such wise filled with the best ancient statuary,\\nthat the loggia, the walks, and all the apartments were adorned with\\nnoble ancient figures of marble, pictures, and other suchlike\\nthings, made by the hands of the best masters who ever lived in\\nItaly or elsewhere. And all these works, in addition to the\\nmagnificence and adornment that they conferred on that garden, were\\nas a school or academy for the young painters and sculptors, as well\\nas for all others who were studying the arts of design, and\\nparticularly for the young nobles; since the Magnificent Lorenzo had\\na strong conviction that those who are born of noble blood can\\nattain to perfection in all things more readily and more speedily\\nthan is possible, for the most part, for men of humble birth, in\\nwhom there are rarely seen those conceptions and that marvellous\\ngenius which are perceived in men of illustrious stock. Moreover,\\nthe less highly born, having generally to defend themselves from\\nhardship and poverty, and being forced in consequence to undertake\\nany sort of work, however mean, are not able to exercise their\\nintellect, or to attain to the highest degree of excellence.\\nWherefore it was well said by the learned Alciato--when speaking of\\nmen of beautiful genius, born in poverty, who are not able to raise\\nthemselves, because, in proportion as they are impelled upwards by\\nthe wings of their genius, so are they held down by their poverty--\\n  Ut me pluma levat, sic grave mergit onus.\\nLorenzo the Magnificent, then, always favoured men of genius, and\\nparticularly such of the nobles as showed an inclination for these\\nour arts; wherefore it is no marvel that from that school there\\nshould have issued some who have amazed the world. And what is more,\\nhe not only gave the means to buy food and clothing to those who,\\nbeing poor, would otherwise not have been able to pursue the studies\\nof design, but also bestowed extraordinary gifts on any one among\\nthem who had acquitted himself in some work better than the others;\\nso that the young students of our arts, competing thus with each\\nother, thereby became very excellent, as I will relate.\\nThe guardian and master of these young men, at that time, was the\\nFlorentine sculptor Bertoldo, an old and practised craftsman, who\\nhad once been a disciple of Donato. He taught them, and likewise had\\ncharge of the works in the garden, and of many drawings, cartoons,\\nand models by the hand of Donato, Pippo, Masaccio, Paolo\\nUccello, Fra Giovanni, Fra Filippo, and other masters, both native\\nand foreign. It is a sure fact that these arts can only be acquired\\nby a long course of study in drawing and diligently imitating works\\nof excellence; and whoever has not such facilities, however much he\\nmay be assisted by nature, can never arrive at perfection, save late\\nin life.\\nBut to return to the antiquities of the garden; they were in great\\npart dispersed in the year 1494, when Piero, the son of the\\naforesaid Lorenzo, was banished from Florence, all being sold by\\nauction. The greater part of them, however, were restored to the\\nMagnificent Giuliano in the year 1512, at the time when he and the\\nother members of the House of Medici returned to their country; and\\nat the present day they are for the most part preserved in the\\nguardaroba of Duke Cosimo. Truly magnificent was the example thus\\ngiven by Lorenzo, and whenever Princes and other persons of high\\ndegree choose to imitate it, they will always gain everlasting\\nhonour and glory thereby; since he who assists and favours, in their\\nnoble undertakings, men of rare and beautiful genius, from whom the\\nworld receives such beauty, honour, convenience and benefit,\\ndeserves to live for ever in the minds and memories of mankind.\\nAmong those who studied the arts of design in that garden, the\\nfollowing all became very excellent masters; Michelagnolo, the son\\nof Lodovico Buonarroti; Giovan Francesco Rustici; Torrigiano\\nTorrigiani; Francesco Granacci; Niccolò, the son of Jacopo\\nSoggi; Lorenzo di Credi, and Giuliano Bugiardini; and, among the\\nforeigners, Baccio da Montelupo, Andrea Contucci of Monte Sansovino,\\nand others, of whom mention will be made in the proper places.\\nTorrigiano, then, whose Life we are now about to write, was a\\nstudent in the garden with those named above; and he was not only\\npowerful in person, and proud and fearless in spirit, but also by\\nnature so overbearing and choleric, that he was for ever tyrannizing\\nover all the others both with words and deeds. His chief profession\\nwas sculpture, yet he worked with great delicacy in terra-cotta, in\\na very good and beautiful manner. But not being able to endure that\\nany one should surpass him, he would set himself to spoil with his\\nhands such of the works of others as showed an excellence that he\\ncould not achieve with his brain; and if these others resented this,\\nhe often had recourse to something stronger than words. He had a\\nparticular hatred for Michelagnolo, for no other reason than that he\\nsaw him attending zealously to the study of art, and knew that he\\nused to draw in secret at his own house by night and on feast-days,\\nso that he came to succeed better in the garden than all the others,\\nand was therefore much favoured by Lorenzo the Magnificent.\\nWherefore, moved by bitter envy, Torrigiano was always seeking to\\naffront him, both in word and deed; and one day, having come to\\nblows, Torrigiano struck Michelagnolo so hard on the nose with his\\nfist, that he broke it, insomuch that Michelagnolo had his nose\\nflattened for the rest of his life. This matter becoming known to\\nLorenzo, he was so enraged that Torrigiano, if he had not fled from\\nFlorence, would have suffered some heavy punishment.\\nHaving therefore made his way to Rome, where Alexander VI was then\\npressing on the work of the Borgia Tower, Torrigiano executed in it\\na great quantity of stucco-work, in company with other masters.\\nAfterwards, money being offered in the service of Duke Valentino,\\nwho was making war against the people of Romagna, Torrigiano was\\nled away by certain young Florentines; and, having changed himself\\nin a moment from a sculptor to a soldier, he bore himself valiantly\\nin those campaigns of Romagna. He did the same under Paolo Vitelli\\nin the war with Pisa; and he was with Piero de\\' Medici at the action\\non the Garigliano, where he won the right to arms, and the name of a\\nvaliant standard-bearer.\\nBut in the end, recognizing that he was never likely to reach the\\nrank of captain that he desired, although he deserved it, and that\\nhe had saved nothing in the wars, and had, on the contrary, wasted\\nhis time, he returned to sculpture. For certain Florentine\\nmerchants, then, he made small works in marble and bronze, little\\nfigures, which are scattered throughout the houses of citizens in\\nFlorence, and he executed many drawings in a bold and excellent\\nmanner, as may be seen from some by his hand that are in our book,\\ntogether with others which he made in competition with Michelagnolo.\\nAnd having been brought by those merchants to England, he executed\\nthere, in the service of the King, an endless number of works in\\nmarble, bronze, and wood, competing with some masters of that\\ncountry, to all of whom he proved superior. For this he was so well\\nand so richly rewarded, that, if he had not been as reckless and\\nunbridled as he was proud, he might have lived a life of ease and\\nended his days in comfort; but what happened to him was the very\\nopposite.\\nAfter this, having been summoned from England into Spain, he made\\nmany works there, which are scattered about in various places, and\\nare held in great estimation; and, among others, he made a Crucifix\\nof terra-cotta, which is the most marvellous thing that there is in\\nall Spain. For a monastery of Friars of S. Jerome, without the city\\nof Seville, he made another Crucifix; a S. Jerome in Penitence, with\\nhis lion, the figure of that Saint being a portrait of an old\\nhouse-steward of the Botti family, Florentine merchants settled in\\nSpain; and a Madonna with the Child. This last figure was so\\nbeautiful that it led to his making another like it for the Duke of\\nArcus, who, in order to obtain it, made such promises to Torrigiano,\\nthat he believed that it would make him rich for the rest of his\\nlife. The work being finished, the Duke gave him so many of those\\ncoins that are called \"maravedis,\" which are worth little or\\nnothing, that Torrigiano, to whose house there came two persons\\nladen with them, became even more confirmed in his belief that he\\nwas to be a very rich man. But afterwards, having shown this money\\nto a Florentine friend of his, and having asked him to count it and\\nreckon its value in Italian coin, he saw that all that vast sum did\\nnot amount to thirty ducats; at which, holding himself to have been\\nfooled, he went in a violent rage to where the figure was that he\\nhad made for the Duke, and wholly destroyed it. Whereupon that\\nSpaniard, considering himself affronted, denounced Torrigiano as a\\nheretic; on which account he was thrown into prison, and after being\\nexamined every day, and sent from one inquisitor to the other, he\\nwas finally judged to deserve the severest penalty. But this was\\nnever put into execution, because Torrigiano himself was plunged\\nthereby into such melancholy, that, remaining many days without\\neating, and thus becoming very weak, little by little he put an end\\nto his own life; and in this way, by denying himself his food, he\\navoided the shame into which he would perchance have fallen, for it\\nwas believed that he had been condemned to death.\\nThe works of this master date about the year of our salvation, 1515,\\nand he died in the year 1522.\\nGIULIANO AND ANTONIO DA SAN GALLO\\nLIVES OF GIULIANO AND ANTONIO DA SAN GALLO\\nARCHITECTS OF FLORENCE\\nFrancesco di Paolo Giamberti, who was a passing good architect in\\nthe time of Cosimo de\\' Medici, and was much employed by him, had two\\nsons, Giuliano and Antonio, whom he apprenticed to the art of\\nwood-carving. One of these two sons, Giuliano, he placed with\\nFrancione, a joiner, an ingenious person, who gave attention at the\\nsame time to wood-carving and to perspective, and with whom\\nFrancesco was very intimate, since they had executed many works in\\ncompany, both in carving and in architecture, for Lorenzo de\\'\\nMedici. This Giuliano learnt so well all that Francione taught him,\\nthat the carvings and beautiful perspectives that he afterwards\\nexecuted by himself in the choir of the Duomo of Pisa are still\\nregarded not without marvel at the present day, even among the many\\nnew perspectives.\\nWhile Giuliano was studying design, and his young blood ran hot in\\nhis veins, the army of the Duke of Calabria, by reason of the hatred\\nwhich that lord bore to Lorenzo de\\' Medici, encamped before\\nCastellina, in order to occupy the dominions of the Signoria of\\nFlorence, and also, if this should be successful, in order to\\naccomplish some greater design. Wherefore Lorenzo the Magnificent\\nwas forced to send an engineer to Castellina, who might make mills\\nand bastions, and should have the charge of handling the artillery,\\nwhich few men at that time were able to do; and he sent thither\\nGiuliano, considering him to have a mind more able, more ready, and\\nmore resolute than any other man, and knowing him already as the son\\nof Francesco, who had been a devoted servant of the House of Medici.\\nArriving at Castellina, therefore, Giuliano fortified that place\\nwith good walls and mills, both within and without, and furnished\\nit with everything else necessary for the defence. Then, observing\\nthat the artillery-men stood at a great distance from their pieces,\\nhandling, loading, and discharging them with much timidity, he gave\\nhis attention to this, and so contrived that from that time onwards\\nthe artillery did harm to no one, whereas it had previously killed\\nmany of them, since they had not had judgment and knowledge enough\\nto avoid suffering injury from the recoil. Having therefore taken\\ncharge of the artillery, Giuliano showed great skill in discharging\\nit to the best possible advantage; and the Duke\\'s forces so lost\\nheart by reason of this and other adverse circumstances, that they\\nwere glad to make terms and depart from the town. In consequence of\\nthis Giuliano won no little praise from Lorenzo in Florence, and was\\nlooked upon with favour and affection ever afterwards.\\nHaving meanwhile given his attention to architecture, he began the\\nfirst cloister of the Monastery of Cestello, and executed that part\\nof it that is seen to be of the Ionic Order; placing capitals on the\\ncolumns with volutes curving downwards to the collarino, where the\\nshaft of the column ends, and making, below the ovoli and the\\nfusarole, a frieze, one-third in height of the diameter of the\\ncolumn. This capital was copied from a very ancient one of marble,\\nfound at Fiesole by Messer Leonardo Salutati, Bishop of that place,\\nwho kept it for some time, together with other antiquities, in a\\nhouse and garden that he occupied in the Via di S. Gallo, opposite\\nto S. Agata; and it is now in the possession of Messer Giovan\\nBattista da Ricasoli, Bishop of Pistoia, and is prized for its beauty\\nand variety, since among the ancient capitals there has not been\\nseen another like it. But that cloister remained unfinished, because\\nthose monks were not then able to bear such an expense.\\nMeanwhile Giuliano had come into even greater credit with Lorenzo;\\nand the latter, who was intending to build a palace at Poggio a\\nCajano, a place between Florence and Pistoia, and had caused several\\nmodels to be made for it by Francione and by others, commissioned\\nGiuliano, also, to make one of the sort of building that he proposed\\nto erect. And Giuliano made it so completely different in form from\\nthe others, and so much to Lorenzo\\'s fancy, that he began\\nstraightway to have it carried into execution, as the best of all\\nthe models; on which account he took Giuliano even more into his\\nfavour, and ever afterwards gave him an allowance.\\nAfter this, Giuliano wishing to make a vaulted ceiling for the great\\nhall of that palace in the manner that we call barrel-shaped,\\nLorenzo could not believe, on account of the great space, that it\\ncould be raised. Whereupon Giuliano, who was building a house for\\nhimself in Florence, made a ceiling for his hall according to the\\ndesign of the other, in order to convince the mind of that\\nMagnificent Prince; and Lorenzo therefore gave orders for the\\nceiling at the Poggio to be carried out, which was successfully\\ndone.\\nBy that time the fame of Giuliano had so increased, that, at the\\nentreaty of the Duke of Calabria, he was commissioned by Lorenzo the\\nMagnificent to make the model for a palace that was to be built at\\nNaples; and he spent a long time over executing it. Now while he was\\nworking at this, the Castellan of Ostia, then Bishop della Rovere,\\nwho after a time became Pope Julius II, wishing to restore that\\nstronghold and to put it into good order, and having heard the fame\\nof Giuliano, sent to Florence for him; and, having supplied him with\\na good provision, he kept him employed for two years in making\\ntherein all the useful improvements that he was able to execute by\\nmeans of his art. And to the end that the model for the Duke of\\nCalabria might not be neglected, but might be brought to conclusion,\\nhe left it to his brother Antonio, who finished it according to his\\ndirections, which, in executing it and carrying it to completion, he\\nfollowed with great diligence, for he was no less competent in that\\nart than Giuliano himself. Now Giuliano was advised by the elder\\nLorenzo to present it in person, to the end that he might show from\\nthe model itself the difficulties that he had triumphed over in\\nmaking it. Whereupon he departed for Naples, and, having presented\\nthe work, was received with honour; for men were as much impressed\\nby the gracious manner in which the Magnificent Lorenzo had sent\\nhim, as they were struck with marvel at the masterly work in the\\nmodel, which gave such satisfaction that the building was\\nstraightway begun near the Castel Nuovo.\\nAfter Giuliano had been some time in Naples, he sought leave from\\nthe Duke to return to Florence; whereupon he was presented by the\\nKing with horses and garments, and, among other things, with a\\nsilver cup containing some hundreds of ducats. These things Giuliano\\nwould not accept, saying that he served a patron who had no need of\\nsilver or gold, but that if he did indeed wish to give him some\\npresent or some token of approbation, to show that he had been in\\nthat city, he might bestow upon him some of his antiquities, which\\nhe would choose himself. These the King granted to him most\\nliberally, both for love of the Magnificent Lorenzo and on account\\nof Giuliano\\'s own worth; and they were a head of the Emperor\\nHadrian, which is now above the door of the garden at the house of\\nthe Medici, a nude woman, more than life-size, and a Cupid sleeping,\\nall in marble and in the round. Giuliano sent them as presents to\\nthe Magnificent Lorenzo, who expressed vast delight at the gift, and\\nnever tired of praising the action of this most liberal of\\ncraftsmen, who had refused gold and silver for the sake of art, a\\nthing which few would have done. That Cupid is now in the guardaroba\\nof Duke Cosimo.\\nHaving then returned to Florence, Giuliano was received most\\ngraciously by the Magnificent Lorenzo. Now the fancy had taken that\\nPrince to build a convent capable of holding a hundred friars,\\nwithout the Porta S. Gallo, in order to give satisfaction to Fra\\nMariano da Ghinazzano, a most learned member of the Order of Eremite\\nFriars of S. Augustine. For this convent models were made by many\\narchitects, and in the end that of Giuliano was put into execution,\\nwhich was the reason that Lorenzo, from this work, gave him the name\\nof Giuliano da San Gallo. Wherefore Giuliano, who heard himself\\ncalled by everyone \"da San Gallo,\" said one day in jest to the\\nMagnificent Lorenzo, \"By giving me this new name of \\'da San Gallo,\\'\\nyou are making me lose the ancient name of my house, so that, in\\nplace of going forward in the matter of lineage, as I thought to do,\\nI am going backward.\" Whereupon Lorenzo answered that he would\\nrather have him become the founder of a new house through his own\\nworth, than depend on others; at which Giuliano was well content.\\nMeanwhile the work of S. Gallo was carried on, together with\\nLorenzo\\'s other buildings; but neither the convent nor the others\\nwere finished, by reason of the death of Lorenzo. And even the\\ncompleted part of this structure of S. Gallo did not long remain\\nstanding, because in 1530, on account of the siege of Florence, it\\nwas destroyed and thrown to the ground, together with the whole\\nsuburb, the piazza of which was completely surrounded by very\\nbeautiful buildings; and at the present day there is no trace to be\\nseen there of house, church, or convent.\\nAt this time there took place the death of the King of Naples,\\nwhereupon Giuliano Gondi, a very rich Florentine merchant, returned\\nfrom that city to Florence, and commissioned Giuliano da San Gallo,\\nwith whom he had become very intimate on account of his visit to\\nNaples, to build him a palace in rustic work, opposite to S.\\nFirenze, above the place where the lions used to be. This palace was\\nto form the angle of the piazza and to face the old Mercatanzia; but\\nthe death of Giuliano Gondi put a stop to the work. In it, among\\nother things, Giuliano made a chimney-piece, very rich in carvings,\\nand so varied and beautiful in composition, that up to that time\\nthere had never been seen the like, nor one with such a wealth of\\nfigures. The same master made a palace for a Venetian in Camerata,\\nwithout the Porta a Pinti, and many houses for private citizens, of\\nwhich there is no need to make mention.\\nLorenzo the Magnificent, in order to benefit the commonwealth and\\nadorn the State, and at the same time to leave behind him some\\nsplendid monument, in addition to the endless number that he had\\nalready erected, wished to execute the fortification of the Poggio\\nImperiale, above Poggibonsi, on the road to Rome, with a view to\\nfounding a city there; and he would not lay it out without the\\nadvice and design of Giuliano. Wherefore that master began that most\\nfamous structure, in which he made the well-designed and beautiful\\nrange of fortifications that we see at the present day.\\nThese works brought him such fame, that he was then summoned to\\nMilan, through the mediation of Lorenzo, by the Duke of Milan, to\\nthe end that he might make for him the model of a palace; and there\\nGiuliano was no less honoured by the Duke than he had previously\\nbeen honoured by the King of Naples, when that Sovereign had invited\\nhim to that city. For when he had presented the model to him, on\\nthe part of the Magnificent Lorenzo, the Duke was filled with\\nastonishment and marvel at seeing the vast number of beautiful\\nadornments in it, so well arranged and distributed, and all\\naccommodated in their places with art and grace; for which reason\\nall the materials necessary for the work were got together, and they\\nbegan to put it into execution. In the same city, together with\\nGiuliano, was Leonardo da Vinci, who was working for the Duke; and\\nLeonardo, speaking with Giuliano about the casting of the horse that\\nhe was proposing to make, received from him some excellent\\nsuggestions. This work was broken to pieces on the arrival of the\\nFrench, so that the horse was never finished; nor could the palace\\nbe brought to completion.\\nHaving returned to Florence, Giuliano found that his brother\\nAntonio, who worked for him on his models, had become so excellent,\\nthat there was no one in his day who was a better master in carving,\\nparticularly for large Crucifixes of wood; to which witness is borne\\nby the one over the high-altar of the Nunziata in Florence, by\\nanother that is kept by the Friars of S. Gallo in S. Jacopo tra\\nFossi, and by a third in the Company of the Scalzo, which are all\\nheld to be very good. But Giuliano removed him from that profession\\nand caused him to give his attention to architecture, in company\\nwith himself, since he had many works to execute, both public and\\nprivate.\\nNow it happened, as it is always happening, that Fortune, the enemy\\nof talent, robbed the followers of the arts of their hope and\\nsupport by the death of Lorenzo de\\' Medici, which was a heavy loss\\nnot only to all able craftsmen and to his country, but also to all\\nItaly. Wherefore Giuliano, together with all the other lofty\\nspirits, was left wholly inconsolable; and in his grief he betook\\nhimself to Prato, near Florence, in order to build the Temple of the\\nMadonna delle Carcere, since all building in Florence, both public\\nand private, was at a standstill. He lived in Prato, therefore,\\nthree whole years, supporting the expense, discomfort, and sorrow as\\nbest he could.\\nAt the end of that time, it being proposed to roof the Church of the\\nMadonna at Loreto, and to raise the cupola, which had been formerly\\nbegun but not finished by Giuliano da Maiano, and those who had\\ncharge of the matter doubting that the piers were too weak to bear\\nsuch a weight, they wrote, therefore, to Giuliano, that if he\\ndesired such a work, he should go and see it for himself. And having\\ngone, like the bold and able man that he was, he showed them that\\nthe cupola could be raised with ease, and that he had courage enough\\nfor the task; and so many, and of such a kind, were the reasons that\\nhe put before them, that the work was allotted to him. After\\nreceiving this commission, he caused the work in Prato to be\\ndespatched, and made his way, with the same master-builders and\\nstone-cutters, to Loreto. And to the end that this structure,\\nbesides beauty of form, might be firm, solid, stable, and well bound\\nin the stonework, he sent to Rome for pozzolana; nor was any\\nlime used that was not mixed with it, nor any stone built in without\\nit; and thus, within the space of three years, it was brought to\\nperfect completion, ready for use.\\nGiuliano then went to Rome, where, for Pope Alexander VI, he\\nrestored the roof of S. Maria Maggiore, which was falling into ruin;\\nand he made there the ceiling that is to be seen at the present day.\\nWhile he was thus employed about the Court, Bishop della Rovere, who\\nhad been the friend of Giuliano from the time when he was Castellan\\nof Ostia, and who had been created Cardinal of S. Pietro in Vincula,\\ncaused him to make a model for the Palace of S. Pietro in Vincula.\\nAnd a little time after, desiring to build a palace in his own city\\nof Savona, he wished to have it erected likewise from the design and\\nunder the eye of Giuliano. But such a journey was difficult for\\nGiuliano, for the reason that his ceiling was not yet finished, and\\nPope Alexander would not let him go. He entrusted the finishing of\\nit, therefore, to his brother Antonio, who, having a good and\\nversatile intelligence, and coming thus into contact with the Court,\\nentered into the service of the Pope, who conceived a very great\\naffection for him; and this he proved when he resolved to restore,\\nwith new foundations and with defences after the manner of a castle,\\nthe Mausoleum of Hadrian, now called the Castello di S. Angelo, for\\nAntonio was made overseer of this undertaking, and under his\\ndirection were made the great towers below, the ditches, and the\\nrest of the fortifications that we see at the present day. This work\\nbrought him great credit with the Pope, and with his son, Duke\\nValentino; and it led to his building the fortress that is now to be\\nseen at Cività Castellana. Thus, then, while that Pontiff was alive,\\nhe was continually employed in building; and while working for him,\\nhe was rewarded by him no less than he was esteemed.\\nGiuliano had already carried well forward the work at Savona, when\\nthe Cardinal returned to Rome on some business of his own, leaving\\nmany workmen to bring the building to completion after the\\ndirections and design of Giuliano, whom he took with him to Rome.\\nGiuliano made that journey willingly, wishing to see Antonio and his\\nworks; and he stayed there some months. During that time, however,\\nthe Cardinal fell into disgrace with the Pope, and departed from\\nRome, in order not to be taken prisoner, and Giuliano, as before,\\nwent in his company. On arriving at Savona, they set a much greater\\nnumber of master-builders and other artificers to work on the\\nbuilding. But the threats of the Pope against the Cardinal becoming\\nevery day louder, it was not long before he made his way to Avignon.\\nFrom there he sent as a present to the King of France a model for a\\npalace that Giuliano had made for him, which was marvellous, very\\nrich in ornament, and spacious enough for the accommodation of his\\nwhole Court. The royal Court was at Lyons when Giuliano presented\\nhis model; and the gift was so welcome and acceptable to the King,\\nthat he rewarded Giuliano liberally and gave him infinite praise,\\nbesides rendering many thanks for it to the Cardinal, who was at\\nAvignon.\\nMeanwhile they received news that the palace at Savona was already\\nnearly finished; whereupon the Cardinal determined that Giuliano\\nshould once more see the work, and Giuliano, having gone for this\\npurpose to Savona, had not been there long when it was completely\\nfinished. Then, desiring to return to Florence, where he had not\\nbeen for a long time, Giuliano took the road for that city together\\nwith his master-builders. Now at that time the King of France had\\nrestored Pisa her liberty, and the war between the Florentines and\\nthe Pisans was still raging; and Giuliano, wishing to pass through\\nPisan territory, had a safe-conduct made out for his company at\\nLucca, for they had no small apprehension about the Pisan soldiers.\\nNevertheless, while passing near Altopascio, they were captured by\\nthe Pisans, who cared nothing for safe-conducts or for any other\\nwarrant that they might have. And for six months Giuliano was\\ndetained in Pisa, his ransom being fixed at three hundred ducats;\\nnor was he able to return to Florence until he had paid it.\\nAntonio had heard this news in Rome, and, desiring to see his native\\ncity and his brother again, obtained leave to depart from Rome; and\\non his way he designed for Duke Valentino the fortress of\\nMontefiascone. Finally, in the year 1503, he reached Florence, where\\nthe two brothers and their friends took joyful pleasure in each\\nother\\'s company.\\nThere now ensued the death of Alexander VI, and the election of Pius\\nIII, who lived but a short time; whereupon the Cardinal of S. Pietro\\nin Vincula was created Pontiff, under the name of Pope Julius II;\\nwhich brought great joy to Giuliano, on account of his having been\\nso long in his service, and he determined, therefore, to go to kiss\\nthe Pope\\'s foot. Having then arrived in Rome, he was warmly received\\nand welcomed lovingly, and was straightway commissioned to execute\\nthe first buildings undertaken by that Pope before the coming of\\nBramante.\\nAntonio, who had remained in Florence, continued, in the absence of\\nGiuliano (Piero Soderini being Gonfalonier), the building of the\\nPoggio Imperiale, to which all the Pisan prisoners were sent to\\nlabour, in order to finish the work the quicker. After this, by\\nreason of the troubles at Arezzo, the old fortress was destroyed,\\nand Antonio made the model for the new one, with the consent of\\nGiuliano, who had come from Rome for this purpose, but soon returned\\nthither; and this work was the reason that Antonio was appointed\\narchitect to the Commune of Florence for all the fortifications.\\nOn the return of Giuliano to Rome, the question was being debated as\\nto whether the divine Michelagnolo Buonarroti should make the tomb\\nof Pope Julius; whereupon Giuliano exhorted the Pope to pursue that\\nundertaking, adding that it seemed to him that it was necessary to\\nbuild a special chapel for such a monument, and that it should not\\nbe placed in the old S. Pietro, in which there was no space for it,\\nwhereas a new chapel would bring out all the perfection of the work.\\nAfter many architects, then, had made designs, the matter little by\\nlittle became one of such importance, that, in place of erecting a\\nchapel, a beginning was made with the great fabric of the new S.\\nPietro. There had arrived in Rome, about that time, the architect\\nBramante of Castel Durante, who had been in Lombardy; and he went to\\nwork in such a manner, with various extraordinary means and methods\\nof his own, and with his fantastic ideas, having on his side\\nBaldassarre Peruzzi, Raffaello da Urbino, and other architects, that\\nhe put the whole undertaking into confusion; whereby much time was\\nconsumed in discussions. Finally--so well did he know how to set\\nabout the matter--the work was entrusted to him, as the man who had\\nshown the finest judgment, the best intelligence, and the greatest\\ninvention.\\nGiuliano, resenting this, for it appeared to him that he had\\nreceived an affront from the Pope, in view of the faithful service\\nthat he had rendered to him when his rank was not so high, and of\\nthe promise made to him by the Pope that he should have that\\nbuilding, sought leave to go; and so, notwithstanding that he was\\nappointed companion to Bramante for other edifices that were being\\nerected in Rome, he departed, and returned, with many gifts received\\nfrom that Pontiff, to Florence.\\nThis was a great joy to Piero Soderini, who straightway set him to\\nwork. Nor had six months gone by, when Messer Bartolommeo della\\nRovere, the nephew of the Pope, and a friend of Giuliano, wrote to\\nhim in the name of his Holiness that he should return for his own\\nadvantage to Rome; but neither terms nor promises availed to move\\nGiuliano, who considered that he had been put to shame by the Pope.\\nFinally, however, a letter was written to Piero Soderini, urging him\\nin one way or another to send Giuliano to Rome, since his Holiness\\nwished to finish the fortifications of the Great Round Tower, which\\nhad been begun by Nicholas V, and likewise those of the Borgo and\\nthe Belvedere, with other works; and Giuliano allowed himself to be\\npersuaded by Soderini, and therefore went to Rome, where he received\\na gracious welcome and many gifts from the Pope.\\nHaving afterwards gone to Bologna, from which the Bentivogli had\\njust been driven out, the Pope resolved, by the advice of Giuliano,\\nto have a figure of himself in bronze made by Michelagnolo\\nBuonarroti; and this was carried out, as will be related in the Life\\nof Michelagnolo himself. Giuliano also followed the Pope to\\nMirandola, and after it was taken, having endured much fatigue and\\nmany discomforts, he returned with the Court to Rome. But the\\nfurious desire to drive the French out of Italy not having yet got\\nout of the head of the Pope, he strove to wrest the government of\\nFlorence out of the hands of Piero Soderini, whose power was no\\nsmall hindrance to him in the project that he had in mind.\\nWhereupon, since the Pontiff, for these reasons, had turned aside\\nfrom building and had embroiled himself in wars, Giuliano, by this\\ntime weary, and perceiving that attention was being given only to\\nthe construction of S. Pietro, and not much even to that, sought\\nleave from him to depart. But the Pope answered him in anger, \"Do\\nyou believe that you are the only Giuliano da San Gallo to be\\nfound?\" To which he replied that none could be found equal to him in\\nfaithful service, while he himself would easily find Princes truer\\nto their promises than the Pope had been towards him. However, the\\nPontiff would by no means give him leave to go, saying that he would\\nspeak to him about it another time.\\nMeanwhile Bramante, having brought Raffaello da Urbino to Rome, set\\nhim to work at painting the Papal apartments; whereupon Giuliano,\\nperceiving that the Pope took great delight in those pictures, and\\nknowing that he wished to have the ceiling of the chapel of his\\nuncle Sixtus painted, spoke to him of Michelagnolo, adding that he\\nhad already executed the bronze statue in Bologna. Which news\\npleased the Pope so much that he sent for Michelagnolo, who, on\\narriving in Rome, received the commission for the ceiling of that\\nchapel.\\nA little time after this, Giuliano coming back once more to seek\\nleave from the Pope to depart, his Holiness, seeing him determined\\non this, was content that he should return to Florence, without\\nforfeiting his favour; and, after having blessed him, he gave him a\\npurse of red satin containing five hundred crowns, telling him that\\nhe might return home to rest, but that he would always be his\\nfriend. Giuliano, then, having kissed the sacred foot, returned to\\nFlorence, at the very time when Pisa was surrounded and besieged by\\nthe army of Florence. No sooner had he arrived, therefore, than\\nPiero Soderini, after the due greetings, sent him to the camp to\\nhelp the military commissaries, who had found themselves unable to\\nprevent the Pisans from passing provisions into Pisa by way of the\\nArno. Giuliano made a design for a bridge of boats to be built at\\nsome better season, and then went back to Florence; and when spring\\nhad come, taking with him his brother Antonio, he made his way to\\nPisa, where they constructed a bridge, which was a very ingenious\\npiece of work, since, besides the fact that, rising or falling with\\nthe water, and being well bound with chains, it stood safe and sound\\nagainst floods, it carried out the desires of the commissaries in\\nsuch a manner, cutting off Pisa from access to the sea by way of the\\nArno, that the Pisans, having no other expedient in their sore\\nstraits, were forced to come to terms with the Florentines; and so\\nthey surrendered. Nor was it long before the same Piero Soderini\\nagain sent Giuliano, with a vast number of master-builders, to Pisa,\\nwhere with extraordinary swiftness he erected the fortress that\\nstill stands at the Porta a S. Marco, and also the gate itself,\\nwhich he built in the Doric Order. And the while that Giuliano was\\nengaged on this work, which was until the year 1512, Antonio went\\nthrough the whole dominion, inspecting and restoring the fortresses\\nand other public buildings.\\nAfter this, by the favour of the same Pope Julius, the house of\\nMedici was reinstated in the government of Florence, from which they\\nhad been driven out on the invasion of Italy by Charles VIII, King\\nof France, and Piero Soderini was expelled from the Palace; and the\\nMedici showed their gratitude to Giuliano and Antonio for the\\nservices that they had rendered in the past to their illustrious\\nfamily. Now Cardinal Giovanni de\\' Medici having been elected Pope a\\nshort time after the death of Julius II, Giuliano was forced once\\nagain to betake himself to Rome; where, Bramante dying not long\\nafter his arrival, it was proposed to give to Giuliano the charge of\\nthe building of S. Pietro. But he, being worn out by his labours,\\nand crushed down by old age and by the stone, which made his life a\\nburden, returned by leave of his Holiness to Florence; and that\\ncommission was given to the most gracious Raffaello da Urbino. And\\nGiuliano, after two years, was pressed so sorely by his malady, that\\nhe died at the age of seventy-four in the year 1517, leaving his\\nname to the world, his body to the earth, and his soul to God.\\nBy his departure he left a heavy burden of sorrow to his brother\\nAntonio, who loved him tenderly, and to a son of his own named\\nFrancesco, who was engaged in sculpture, although he was still quite\\nyoung. This Francesco, who has preserved up to our own day all the\\ntreasures of his elders, and holds them in veneration, executed many\\nworks at Florence and elsewhere, both in sculpture and in\\narchitecture, and by his hand is the Madonna of marble, with the\\nChild in her arms, and lying in the lap of S. Anne, that is in\\nOrsanmichele; which work, with the figures carved in the round out\\nof one single block, was held, as it still is, to be very beautiful.\\nHe has also executed the tomb that Pope Clement caused to be made\\nfor Piero de\\' Medici at Monte Cassino, besides many other works, of\\nwhich no mention is here made because the said Francesco is still\\nalive.\\nAfter the death of Giuliano, Antonio, being a man who was not\\nwilling to stay idle, made two large Crucifixes of wood, one of\\nwhich was sent into Spain, while the other, by order of the\\nVice-Chancellor, Cardinal Giulio de\\' Medici, was taken by Domenico\\nBuoninsegni into France. It being then proposed to build the\\nfortress of Livorno, Antonio was sent thither by Cardinal de\\' Medici\\nto make the design for it; which he did, although it was afterwards\\nnot carried completely into execution, nor even after the method\\nsuggested by Antonio. After this, the men of Montepulciano\\ndetermining, by reason of the miracles wrought by an image of Our\\nLady, to build a temple for it at very great cost, Antonio made the\\nmodel for this, and became head of the undertaking; on which account\\nhe visited that building twice a year. At the present day it is to\\nbe seen carried to perfect completion, having been executed with\\nsupreme grace, and with truly marvellous beauty and variety of\\ncomposition, by the genius of Antonio, and all the masonry is of a\\ncertain stone that has a tinge of white, after the manner of\\ntravertine. It stands without the Porta di S. Biagio, on the right\\nhand, half-way up the slope of the hill. At this time, he made a\\nbeginning with a palace in the township of Monte San Sovino, for\\nAntonio di Monte, Cardinal of Santa Prassedia; and he built another\\nfor the same man at Montepulciano, both being executed and finished\\nwith extraordinary grace.\\nHe made the design for the side of the buildings of the Servite\\nFriars (in Florence), on their Piazza, following the order of the\\nLoggia of the Innocenti; and at Arezzo he made models for the aisles\\nof the Madonna delle Lacrime, although that work was very badly\\nconceived, because it is out of harmony with the original part of\\nthe building, and the arches at the ends are not in true line with\\nthe centre. He also made a model for the Madonna of Cortona; but I\\ndo not think that this was put into execution. He was employed in\\nthe siege on the bastions and fortifications within the city, and in\\nthis undertaking he had as a companion his nephew Francesco. After\\nthis, the Giant of the Piazza, executed by the hand of Michelagnolo,\\nhaving been set into place in the time of Giuliano, the brother of\\nour Antonio, it was proposed to set up the other, which had been\\nmade by Baccio Bandinelli; and the task of bringing it safely into\\nposition was given to Antonio, who, taking Baccio d\\' Agnolo as his\\ncompanion, carried this out by means of very powerful machines, and\\nplaced it in safety on the base that had been prepared for that\\npurpose.\\nIn the end, having become old, he took no pleasure in anything save\\nagriculture, of which he had an excellent knowledge. And then, when\\non account of old age he was no longer able to bear the discomforts\\nof this world, he rendered up his soul to God, in the year 1534, and\\nwas laid to rest by the side of his brother Giuliano in the tomb of\\nthe Giamberti, in the Church of S. Maria Novella.\\nThe marvellous works of these two brothers will bear witness before\\nthe world to the extraordinary genius that they possessed; and for\\ntheir lives, their honourable ways, and their every action, they\\nwere held in estimation by all men. Giuliano and Antonio bequeathed\\nto the art of architecture methods that gave the Tuscan Order of\\nbuilding better form than any other architect had yet achieved, and\\nthe Doric Order they enriched with better measures and proportions\\nthan their predecessors, following the rules and canons of\\nVitruvius, had been wont to use. They collected in their houses at\\nFlorence an infinite number of most beautiful antiquities in marble,\\nwhich adorned Florence, and still adorn her, no less than those\\nmasters honoured themselves and their art. Giuliano brought from\\nRome the method of casting vaults with such materials as made them\\nready carved; examples of which may be seen in a room in his own\\nhouse, and in the vaulting of the Great Hall at Poggio a Cajano,\\nwhich is still to be seen there. Wherefore we should acknowledge our\\nobligation to their labours, whereby they fortified the dominion of\\nFlorence, adorned the city, and gave a name, throughout the many\\nregions where they worked, to Florence and to the intellects of\\nTuscany, who, to honour their memory, have written to them these\\nverses--\\n  Cedite Romani structores, cedite Graii,\\n    Artis, Vitruvi, tu quoque cede parens.\\n  Etruscos celebrare viros, testudinis arcus,\\n    Urna, tholus, statuæ, templa, domusque petunt.', \"RAFFAELLO DA URBINO\\n[_RAFFAELLO SANZIO_]\\nPAINTER AND ARCHITECT\\nHow bountiful and benign Heaven sometimes shows itself in showering\\nupon one single person the infinite riches of its treasures, and all\\nthose graces and rarest gifts that it is wont to distribute among\\nmany individuals, over a long space of time, could be clearly seen\\nin the no less excellent than gracious Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino,\\nwho was endowed by nature with all that modesty and goodness which\\nare seen at times in those who, beyond all other men, have added to\\ntheir natural sweetness and gentleness the beautiful adornment of\\ncourtesy and grace, by reason of which they always show themselves\\nagreeable and pleasant to every sort of person and in all their\\nactions. Him nature presented to the world, when, vanquished by art\\nthrough the hands of Michelagnolo Buonarroti, she wished to be\\nvanquished, in Raffaello, by art and character together. And in\\ntruth, since the greater part of the craftsmen who had lived up to\\nthat time had received from nature a certain element of savagery and\\nmadness, which, besides making them strange and eccentric, had\\nbrought it about that very often there was revealed in them rather\\nthe obscure darkness of vice than the brightness and splendour of\\nthose virtues that make men immortal, there was right good reason\\nfor her to cause to shine out brilliantly in Raffaello, as a\\ncontrast to the others, all the rarest qualities of the mind,\\naccompanied by such grace, industry, beauty, modesty, and excellence\\nof character, as would have sufficed to efface any vice, however\\nhideous, and any blot, were it ever so great. Wherefore it may be\\nsurely said that those who are the possessors of such rare and\\nnumerous gifts as were seen in Raffaello da Urbino, are not merely\\nmen, but, if it be not a sin to say it, mortal gods; and that those\\nwho, by means of their works, leave an honourable name written in\\nthe archives of fame in this earthly world of ours, can also hope to\\nhave to enjoy in Heaven a worthy reward for their labours and\\nmerits.\\nRaffaello was born at Urbino, a very famous city in Italy, at three\\no'clock of the night on Good Friday, in the year 1483, to a father\\nnamed Giovanni de' Santi, a painter of no great excellence, and yet\\na man of good intelligence, well able to direct his children on that\\ngood path which he himself had not been fortunate enough to have\\nshown to him in his boyhood. And since Giovanni knew how important\\nit is to rear infants, not with the milk of nurses, but with that of\\ntheir own mothers, no sooner was Raffaello born, to whom with happy\\naugury he gave that name at baptism, than he insisted that this his\\nonly child--and he had no more afterwards--should be suckled by his\\nown mother, and that in his tender years he should have his\\ncharacter formed in the house of his parents, rather than learn less\\ngentle or even boorish ways and habits in the houses of peasants or\\ncommon people. When he was well grown, he began to exercise him in\\npainting, seeing him much inclined to such an art, and possessed of\\na very beautiful genius: wherefore not many years passed before\\nRaffaello, still a boy, became a great help to Giovanni in many\\nworks that he executed in the state of Urbino. In the end, this good\\nand loving father, knowing that his son could learn little from him,\\nmade up his mind to place him with Pietro Perugino, who, as he heard\\ntell, held the first place among painters at that time. He went,\\ntherefore, to Perugia: but not finding Pietro there, he set himself,\\nin order to lessen the annoyance of waiting for him, to execute some\\nworks in S. Francesco. When Pietro had returned from Rome, Giovanni,\\nwho was a gentle and well-bred person, formed a friendship with him,\\nand, when the time appeared to have come, in the most adroit method\\nthat he knew, told him his desire. And so Pietro, who was very\\ncourteous and a lover of beautiful genius, agreed to have Raffaello:\\nwhereupon Giovanni, going off rejoicing to Urbino, took the boy, not\\nwithout many tears on the part of his mother, who loved him dearly,\\nand brought him to Perugia, where Pietro, after seeing Raffaello's\\nmethod of drawing, and his beautiful manners and character,\\nformed a judgment of him which time, from the result, proved to be\\nvery true.\\nIt is a very notable thing that Raffaello, studying the manner of\\nPietro, imitated it in every respect so closely, that his copies\\ncould not be distinguished from his master's originals, and it was\\nnot possible to see any clear difference between his works and\\nPietro's; as is still evident from some figures in a panel in S.\\nFrancesco at Perugia, which he executed in oils for Madonna\\nMaddalena degli Oddi. These are a Madonna who has risen into Heaven,\\nwith Jesus Christ crowning her, while below, round the sepulchre,\\nare the twelve Apostles, contemplating the Celestial Glory, and at\\nthe foot of the panel is a predella divided into three scenes,\\npainted with little figures, of the Madonna receiving the\\nAnnunciation from the Angel, of the Magi adoring Christ, and of\\nChrist in the arms of Simeon in the Temple. This work is executed\\nwith truly supreme diligence; and one who had not a good knowledge\\nof the two manners, would hold it as certain that it is by the hand\\nof Pietro, whereas it is without a doubt by the hand of Raffaello.\\nAfter this work, Pietro returning to Florence on some business of\\nhis own, Raffaello departed from Perugia and went off with some\\nfriends to Città di Castello, where he painted a panel for S.\\nAgostino in the same manner, and likewise one of a Crucifixion for\\nS. Domenico, which, if his name were not written upon it, no one\\nwould believe to be a work by Raffaello, but rather by Pietro. For\\nS. Francesco, also in the same city, he painted a little\\npanel-picture of the Marriage of Our Lady, in which one may\\nrecognize the excellence of Raffaello increasing and growing in\\nrefinement, and surpassing the manner of Pietro. In this work is a\\ntemple drawn in perspective with such loving care, that it is a\\nmarvellous thing to see the difficulties that he was for ever\\nseeking out in this branch of his profession.\\nMeanwhile, when he had acquired very great fame by following his\\nmaster's manner, Pope Pius II had given the commission for\\npainting the library of the Duomo at Siena to Pinturicchio; and he,\\nbeing a friend of Raffaello, and knowing him to be an excellent\\ndraughtsman, brought him to Siena, where Raffaello made for him some\\nof the drawings and cartoons for that work. The reason that he did\\nnot continue at it was that some painters in Siena kept extolling\\nwith vast praise the cartoon that Leonardo da Vinci had made in the\\nSala del Papa of a very beautiful group of horsemen, to be\\npainted afterwards in the Hall of the Palace of the Signoria, and\\nlikewise some nudes executed by Michelagnolo Buonarroti in\\ncompetition with Leonardo, and much better; and Raffaello, on\\naccount of the love that he always bore to the excellent in art, was\\nseized by such a desire to see them, that, putting aside that work\\nand all thought of his own advantage and comfort, he went off to\\nFlorence.\\nHaving arrived there, and being pleased no less with the city than\\nwith those works, which appeared to him to be divine, he determined\\nto take up his abode there for some time; and thus he formed a\\nfriendship with some young painters, among whom were Ridolfo\\nGhirlandajo, Aristotile da San Gallo, and others, and became much\\nhonoured in that city, particularly by Taddeo Taddei, who, being one\\nwho always loved any man inclined to excellence, would have him ever\\nin his house and at his table. And Raffaello, who was gentleness\\nitself, in order not to be beaten in courtesy, made him two\\npictures, which incline to his first manner, derived from Pietro,\\nbut also to the other much better manner that he afterwards acquired\\nby study, as will be related; which pictures are still in the house\\nof the heirs of the said Taddeo.\\nRaffaello also formed a very great friendship with Lorenzo Nasi; and\\nfor this Lorenzo, who had taken a wife about that time, he painted a\\npicture in which he made a Madonna, and between her legs her Son, to\\nwhom a little S. John, full of joy, is offering a bird, with great\\ndelight and pleasure for both of them. In the attitude of each is a\\ncertain childlike simplicity which is wholly lovely, besides that\\nthey are so well coloured, and executed with such diligence, that\\nthey appear to be rather of living flesh than wrought by means of\\ncolour and draughtsmanship; the Madonna, likewise, has an air truly\\nfull of grace and divinity; and the foreground, the landscapes, and\\nin short all the rest of the work, are most beautiful. This\\npicture was held by Lorenzo Nasi, as long as he lived, in very great\\nveneration, both in memory of Raffaello, who had been so much his\\nfriend, and on account of the dignity and excellence of the work;\\nbut afterwards, on August 9, in the year 1548, it met an evil fate,\\nwhen, on account of the collapse of the hill of S. Giorgio, the\\nhouse of Lorenzo fell down, together with the ornate and beautiful\\nhouses of the heirs of Marco del Nero, and other neighbouring\\ndwellings. However, the pieces of the picture being found among the\\nfragments of the ruins, the son of Lorenzo, Battista, who was a great\\nlover of art, had them put together again as well as was possible.\\nAfter these works, Raffaello was forced to depart from Florence and\\ngo to Urbino, where, on account of the death of his mother and of\\nhis father Giovanni, all his affairs were in confusion. While he was\\nliving in Urbino, therefore, he painted for Guidobaldo da\\nMontefeltro, then Captain of the Florentines, two pictures of Our\\nLady, small but very beautiful, and in his second manner, which are\\nnow in the possession of the most illustrious and excellent\\nGuidobaldo, Duke of Urbino. For the same patron he painted a little\\npicture of Christ praying in the Garden, with the three Apostles\\nsleeping at some distance from Him. This painting is so highly\\nfinished, that a miniature could not be better, or in any way\\ndifferent; and after having been a long time in the possession of\\nFrancesco Maria, Duke of Urbino, it was then presented by the most\\nillustrious Signora Leonora, his consort, to the Venetians Don Paolo\\nGiustiniano and Don Pietro Quirini, hermits of the holy Hermitage of\\nCamaldoli, who afterwards placed it, as a relic and a very rare\\nthing, and, in a word, as a work by the hand of Raffaello da Urbino,\\nand also to honour the memory of that most illustrious lady, in the\\napartment of the Superior of that hermitage, where it is held in the\\nveneration that it deserves.\\nHaving executed these works and settled his affairs, Raffaello\\nreturned to Perugia, where he painted a panel-picture of Our Lady,\\nS. John the Baptist, and S. Nicholas, for the Chapel of the Ansidei\\nin the Church of the Servite Friars. And in the Chapel of the\\nMadonna in S. Severo, a little monastery of the Order of Camaldoli,\\nin the same city, he painted in fresco a Christ in Glory, and a God\\nthe Father with angels round Him, and six saints seated, S.\\nBenedict, S. Romualdo, S. Laurence, S. Jerome, S. Mauro, and S.\\nPlacido, three on either side; and on this picture, which was held\\nat that time to be most beautiful for a work in fresco, he wrote his\\nname in large and very legible letters. In the same city, also, he\\nwas commissioned by the Nuns of S. Anthony of Padua to paint a\\npanel-picture of Our Lady, with Jesus Christ fully dressed, as it\\npleased those simple and venerable sisters, in her lap, and on\\neither side of the Madonna S. Peter, S. Paul, S. Cecilia, and S.\\nCatherine; to which two holy virgins he gave the sweetest and most\\nlovely expressions of countenance and the most beautifully varied\\nhead-dresses that are anywhere to be seen, which was a rare thing in\\nthose times. Above this panel, in a lunette, he painted a very\\nbeautiful God the Father, and in the predella of the altar three\\nscenes with little figures, of Christ praying in the Garden, bearing\\nthe Cross (wherein are some soldiers dragging Him along with most\\nbeautiful movements), and lying dead in the lap of His Mother. This\\nwork is truly marvellous and devout; and it is held in great\\nveneration by those nuns, and much extolled by all painters.\\nI will not refrain from saying that it was recognized, after he had\\nbeen in Florence, that he changed and improved his manner so much,\\nfrom having seen many works by the hands of excellent masters, that\\nit had nothing to do with his earlier manner; indeed, the two might\\nhave belonged to different masters, one much more excellent than the\\nother in painting.\\nBefore he departed from Perugia, Madonna Atalanta Baglioni besought\\nhim that he should consent to paint a panel for her chapel in the\\nChurch of S. Francesco; but since he was not able to meet her wishes\\nat that time, he promised her that, after returning from Florence,\\nwhither he was obliged to go on some affairs, he would not fail her.\\nAnd so, having come to Florence, where he applied himself with\\nincredible labour to the studies of his art, he made the cartoon for\\nthat chapel, with the intention of going, as he did, as soon as the\\noccasion might present itself, to put it into execution.\\nWhile he was thus staying in Florence, Agnolo Doni--who was very\\ncareful of his money in other things, but willing to spend it,\\nalthough still with the greatest possible economy, on works of\\npainting and sculpture, in which he much delighted--caused him to\\nmake portraits of himself and of his wife; and these may be seen,\\npainted in his new manner, in the possession of Giovan Battista, his\\nson, in the beautiful and most commodious house that the same Agnolo\\nbuilt on the Corso de' Tintori, near the Canto degli Alberti, in\\nFlorence. For Domenico Canigiani, also, he painted a picture of Our\\nLady, with the Child Jesus welcoming a little S. John brought to Him\\nby S. Elizabeth, who, as she holds him, is gazing with a most\\nanimated expression at a S. Joseph, who is standing with both his\\nhands leaning on a staff, and inclines his head towards her, as\\nthough praising the greatness of God and marvelling that she, so\\nadvanced in years, should have so young a child. And all appear to\\nbe amazed to see with how much feeling and reverence the two\\ncousins, for all their tender age, are caressing one another; not to\\nmention that every touch of colour in the heads, hands, and feet\\nseems to be living flesh rather than a tint laid on by a master of\\nthat art. This most noble picture is now in the possession of the\\nheirs of the said Domenico Canigiani, who hold it in the estimation\\nthat is due to a work by Raffaello da Urbino.\\nThis most excellent of painters studied in the city of Florence the\\nold works of Masaccio; and what he saw in those of Leonardo and\\nMichelagnolo made him give even greater attention to his studies, in\\nconsequence of which he effected an extraordinary improvement in his\\nart and manner. While he was living in Florence, Raffaello, besides\\nother friendships, became very intimate with Fra Bartolommeo di San\\nMarco, being much pleased with his colouring, and taking no little\\npains to imitate it: and in return he taught that good father the\\nprinciples of perspective, to which up to that time the monk had not\\ngiven any attention.\\nBut at the very height of this friendly intercourse, Raffaello was\\nrecalled to Perugia, where he began by finishing the work for the\\naforesaid Madonna Atalanta Baglioni in S. Francesco, for which, as\\nhas been related, he had made the cartoon in Florence. In this most\\ndivine picture there is a Dead Christ being borne to the Sepulchre,\\nexecuted with such freshness and such loving care, that it seems to\\nthe eye to have been only just painted. In the composition of this\\nwork, Raffaello imagined to himself the sorrow that the nearest and\\nmost affectionate relatives of the dead one feel in laying to rest\\nthe body of him who has been their best beloved, and on whom, in\\ntruth, the happiness, honour, and welfare of a whole family have\\ndepended. Our Lady is seen in a swoon; and the heads of all the\\nfigures are very gracious in their weeping, particularly that of S.\\nJohn, who, with his hands clasped, bows his head in such a manner as\\nto move the hardest heart to pity. And in truth, whoever considers\\nthe diligence, love, art, and grace shown by this picture, has great\\nreason to marvel, for it amazes all who behold it, what with the air\\nof the figures, the beauty of the draperies, and, in short, the\\nsupreme excellence that it reveals in every part.\\nThis work finished, he returned to Florence, where he received from\\nthe Dei, citizens of that city, the commission for an altar-panel\\nthat was to be placed in their chapel in S. Spirito; and he began\\nit, and brought the sketch very nearly to completion. At the same\\ntime he painted a picture that was afterwards sent to Siena,\\nalthough, on the departure of Raffaello, it was left with Ridolfo\\nGhirlandajo, to the end that he might finish a piece of blue drapery\\nthat was wanting. This happened because Bramante da Urbino, who was\\nin the service of Julius II, wrote to Raffaello, on account of his\\nbeing distantly related to him and also his compatriot, that he had\\nso wrought upon the Pope, who had caused some new rooms to be made\\n(in the Vatican), that Raffaello would have a chance of showing his\\nworth in them. This proposal pleased Raffaello: wherefore,\\nabandoning his works in Florence, and leaving the panel for the Dei\\nunfinished, in the state in which Messer Baldassarre da Pescia had\\nit placed in the Pieve of his native city after the death of\\nRaffaello, he betook himself to Rome. Having arrived there, he found\\nthat most of the rooms in the Palace had been painted, or were still\\nbeing painted, by a number of masters. To be precise, he saw that\\nthere was one room in which a scene had been finished by Piero della\\nFrancesca; Luca da Cortona had brought one wall nearly to\\ncompletion; and Don Pietro della Gatta, Abbot of S. Clemente\\nat Arezzo, had begun some works there. Bramantino, the Milanese, had\\nlikewise painted many figures, which were mostly portraits from\\nlife, and were held to be very beautiful. After his arrival,\\ntherefore, having been received very warmly by Pope Julius,\\nRaffaello began in the Camera della Segnatura a scene of the\\ntheologians reconciling Philosophy and Astrology with Theology:\\nwherein are portraits of all the sages in the world, disputing in\\nvarious ways. Standing apart are some astrologers, who have made\\nvarious kinds of figures and characters of geomancy and astrology on\\nsome little tablets, which they send to the Evangelists by certain\\nvery beautiful angels; and these Evangelists are expounding them.\\nAmong them is Diogenes with his cup, lying on the steps, and lost in\\nthought, a figure very well conceived, which, for its beauty and the\\ncharacteristic negligence of its dress, is worthy to be extolled.\\nThere, also, are Aristotle and Plato, one with the Timæus in his\\nhand, the other with the Ethics; and round them, in a circle, is a\\ngreat school of philosophers. Nor is it possible to express the\\nbeauty of those astrologers and geometricians who are drawing a vast\\nnumber of figures and characters with compasses on tablets: among\\nwhom, in the figure of a young man, shapely and handsome, who is\\nthrowing out his arms in admiration, and inclining his head, is the\\nportrait of Federigo II, Duke of Mantua, who was then in Rome. There\\nis also a figure that is stooping to the ground, holding in its hand\\na pair of compasses, with which it is making a circle on a tablet:\\nthis is said to be the architect Bramante, and it is no less the man\\nhimself than if he were alive, so well is it drawn. Beside a figure\\nwith its back turned and holding a globe of the heavens in its hand,\\nis the portrait of Zoroaster; and next to him is Raffaello, the\\nmaster of the work, who made his own portrait by means of a mirror,\\nin a youthful head with an air of great modesty, filled with a\\npleasing and excellent grace, and wearing a black cap.\\nNor is one able to describe the beauty and goodness that are to be\\nseen in the heads and figures of the Evangelists, to whose\\ncountenances he gave an air of attention and intentness very true to\\nlife, and particularly in those who are writing. Thus, behind S.\\nMatthew, who is copying the characters from the tablet wherein are\\nthe figures (which is held before him by an angel), and writing them\\ndown in a book, he painted an old man who, having placed a piece of\\npaper on his knee, is copying all that S. Matthew writes down; and\\nwhile intent on his work in that uncomfortable position, he seems to\\ntwist his head and his jaws in time with the motion of the pen. And\\nin addition to the details of the conceptions, which are numerous\\nenough, there is the composition of the whole scene, which is truly\\narranged with so much order and proportion, that he may be said to\\nhave given therein such a proof of his powers as made men understand\\nthat he was resolved to hold the sovereignty, without question,\\namong all who handled the brush.\\nHe also adorned this work with a view in perspective and with many\\nfigures, executed in such a sweet and delicate manner, that Pope\\nJulius was induced thereby to cause all the scenes of the other\\nmasters, both the old and the new, to be thrown to the ground, so\\nthat Raffaello alone might have the glory of all the labours that\\nhad been devoted to these works up to that time. The work of\\nGiovanni Antonio Sodoma of Vercelli, which was above Raffaello's\\npainting, was to be thrown down by order of the Pope; but Raffaello\\ndetermined to make use of its compartments and grotesques. There\\nwere also some medallions, four in number, and in each of these he\\nmade a figure as a symbol of the scenes below, each figure being on\\nthe same side as the scene that it represented. Over the first\\nscene, wherein he painted Philosophy, Astrology, Geometry, and\\nPoetry making peace with Theology, is a woman representing\\nKnowledge, who is seated on a throne that is supported on either\\nside by a figure of the Goddess Cybele, each with those many breasts\\nwhich in ancient times were the attributes of Diana Polymastes; and\\nher dress is of four colours, standing for the four elements; from\\nthe head downwards there is the colour of fire, below the girdle\\nthat of the sky, from the groin to the knees there is the colour of\\nearth, and the rest, down to the feet, is the colour of water. With\\nher, also, are some truly beautiful little boys. In another\\nmedallion, on the side towards the window that looks over the\\nBelvedere, is a figure of Poetry, who is in the form of Polyhymnia,\\ncrowned with laurel, and holds an antique musical instrument in one\\nhand, and a book in the other, and has her legs crossed. With a more\\nthan human beauty of expression in her countenance, she stands with\\nher eyes uplifted towards Heaven, accompanied by two little boys,\\nwho are lively and spirited, and who make a group of beautiful\\nvariety both with her and with the others. On this side, over the\\naforesaid window, Raffaello afterwards painted Mount Parnassus. In\\nthe third medallion, which is above the scene where the Holy Doctors\\nare ordaining the Mass, is a figure of Theology, no less beautiful\\nthan the others, with books and other things round her, and likewise\\naccompanied by little boys. And in the fourth medallion, over the\\nother window, which looks out on the court, he painted Justice with\\nher scales, and her sword uplifted, and with the same little boys\\nthat are with the others; of which the effect is supremely\\nbeautiful, for in the scene on the wall below he depicted the giving\\nof the Civil and the Canon Law, as we will relate in the proper\\nplace.\\nIn like manner, on the same ceiling, in the angles of the\\npendentives, he executed four scenes which he drew and coloured with\\ngreat diligence, but with figures of no great size. In one of these,\\nthat near the Theology, he painted the Sin of Adam, the eating of\\nthe apple, which he executed with a most delicate manner; and in the\\nsecond, near the Astrology, is a figure of that science setting the\\nfixed stars and planets in their places. In the next, that belonging\\nto Mount Parnassus, is Marsyas, whom Apollo has caused to be bound\\nto a tree and flayed; and on the side of the scene wherein the\\nDecretals are given, there is the Judgment of Solomon, showing him\\nproposing to have the child cut in half. These four scenes are all\\nfull of expression and feeling, and executed with excellent\\ndraughtsmanship, and with pleasing and gracious colouring.\\nBut now, having finished with the vaulting--that is, the ceiling--of\\nthat apartment, it remains for us to describe what he painted below\\nthe things mentioned above, wall by wall. On the wall towards the\\nBelvedere, where there are Mount Parnassus and the Fount of Helicon,\\nhe made round that mount a laurel wood of darkest shadows, in the\\nverdure of which one almost sees the leaves quivering in the gentle\\nzephyrs; and in the air are vast numbers of naked Loves, most\\nbeautiful in feature and expression, who are plucking branches of\\nlaurel and with them making garlands, which they throw and scatter\\nabout the mount. Over the whole, in truth, there seems to breathe a\\nspirit of divinity, so beautiful are the figures, and such the\\nnobility of the picture, which makes whoever studies it with\\nattention marvel how a human brain, by the imperfect means of mere\\ncolours, and by excellence of draughtsmanship, could make painted\\nthings appear alive. Most lifelike, also, are those Poets who are\\nseen here and there about the mount, some standing, some seated,\\nsome writing, and others discoursing, and others, again, singing or\\nconversing together, in groups of four or six, according as it\\npleased him to distribute them. There are portraits from nature of\\nall the most famous poets, ancient and modern, and some only just\\ndead, or still living in his day; which were taken from statues or\\nmedals, and many from old pictures, and some, who were still alive,\\nportrayed from the life by himself. And to begin with one end, there\\nare Ovid, Virgil, Ennius, Tibullus, Catullus, Propertius, and Homer;\\nthe last-named, blind and chanting his verses with uplifted head,\\nhaving at his feet one who is writing them down. Next, in a group,\\nare all the nine Muses and Apollo, with such beauty in their aspect,\\nand such divinity in the figures, that they breathe out a spirit of\\ngrace and life. There, also, are the learned Sappho, the most divine\\nDante, the gracious Petrarca, and the amorous Boccaccio, who are\\nwholly alive, with Tibaldeo, and an endless number of other moderns;\\nand this scene is composed with much grace, and executed with\\ndiligence.\\nOn another wall he made a Heaven, with Christ, Our Lady, S. John the\\nBaptist, the Apostles, the Evangelists, and the Martyrs, enthroned\\non clouds, with God the Father sending down the Holy Spirit over\\nthem all, and particularly over an endless number of saints, who are\\nbelow, writing the Mass, and engaged in disputation about the Host,\\nwhich is on the altar. Among these are the four Doctors of the\\nChurch, who have about them a vast number of saints, such as\\nDominic, Francis, Thomas Aquinas, Buonaventura, Scotus, and Nicholas\\nof Lira, with Dante, Fra Girolamo Savonarola of Ferrara, and all the\\nChristian theologians, with an infinite number of portraits from\\nnature; and in the air are four little children, who are holding\\nopen the Gospels. Anything more graceful or more perfect than these\\nfigures no painter could create, since those saints are represented\\nas seated in the air, in a circle, and so well, that in truth,\\nbesides the appearance of life that the colouring gives them, they\\nare foreshortened and made to recede in such a manner, that they\\nwould not be otherwise if they were in relief. Moreover, their\\nvestments show a rich variety, with most beautiful folds in the\\ndraperies, and the expressions of the heads are more Divine than\\nhuman; as may be seen in that of Christ, which reveals all the\\nclemency and devoutness that Divinity can show to mortal men through\\nthe medium of painting. For Raffaello received from nature a\\nparticular gift of making the expressions of his heads very sweet\\nand gracious; of which we have proof also in the Madonna, who, with\\nher hands pressed to her bosom, gazing in contemplation upon her\\nSon, seems incapable of refusing any favour; not to mention that he\\nshowed a truly beautiful sense of fitness, giving a look of age to\\nthe expressions of the Holy Patriarchs, simplicity to the Apostles,\\nand faith to the Martyrs. Even more art and genius did he display in\\nthe holy Christian Doctors, in whose features, while they make\\ndisputation throughout the scene in groups of six or three or two,\\nthere may be seen a kind of eagerness and distress in seeking to\\nfind the truth of that which is in question, revealing this by\\ngesticulating with their hands, making various movements of their\\npersons, turning their ears to listen, knitting their brows, and\\nexpressing astonishment in many different ways, all truly well\\nvaried and appropriate; save only the four Doctors of the Church,\\nwho, illumined by the Holy Spirit, are unravelling and expounding,\\nby means of the Holy Scriptures, all the problems of the Gospels,\\nwhich are held up by those little boys who have them in their hands\\nas they hover in the air.\\nOn another wall, where the other window is, on one side, he painted\\nJustinian giving the Laws to the Doctors to be revised; and above\\nthis, Temperance, Fortitude, and Prudence. On the other side he\\npainted the Pope giving the Canonical Decretals; for which Pope he\\nmade a portrait from life of Pope Julius, and, beside him, Cardinal\\nGiovanni de' Medici, who became Pope Leo, Cardinal Antonio di Monte,\\nand Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, who afterwards became Pope Paul\\nIII, with other portraits.\\nThe Pope was very well satisfied with this work; and in order to\\nmake the panelling worthy of the paintings, he sent to Monte Oliveto\\ndi Chiusuri, a place in the territory of Siena, for Fra Giovanni da\\nVerona, a great master at that time of perspective-views in inlaid\\nwoodwork, who made there not only the panelling right round, but\\nalso very beautiful doors and seats, wrought with perspective-views,\\nwhich brought him great favour, rewards, and honour from the Pope.\\nAnd it is certain that in that craft there was never any man more\\nable than Giovanni, either in design or in workmanship: of which we\\nstill have proof in the Sacristy, wrought most beautifully with\\nperspective-views in woodwork, of S. Maria in Organo in his native\\ncity of Verona, in the choir of Monte Oliveto di Chiusuri and that\\nof S. Benedetto at Siena, in the Sacristy of Monte Oliveto at\\nNaples, and also in the choir of the Chapel of Paolo da Tolosa in\\nthe same place, executed by that master. Wherefore he well deserved\\nto be esteemed and held in very great honour by the convent of his\\nOrder, in which he died at the age of sixty-eight, in the year 1537.\\nOf him, as of a person truly excellent and rare, I have thought it\\nright to make mention, believing that this was due to his talents,\\nwhich, as will be related in another place, led to many beautiful\\nworks being made by other masters after him.\\nBut to return to Raffaello; his powers grew in such a manner, that\\nhe was commissioned by the Pope to go on to paint a second room,\\nthat near the Great Hall. And at this time, when he had gained a\\nvery great name, he also made a portrait of Pope Julius in a picture\\nin oils, so true and so lifelike, that the portrait caused all who\\nsaw it to tremble, as if it had been the living man himself. This\\nwork is now in S. Maria del Popolo, together with a very beautiful\\npicture of Our Lady, painted at the same time by the same master,\\nand containing the Nativity of Jesus Christ, wherein is the Virgin\\nlaying a veil over her Son, whose beauty is such, both in the air of\\nthe head and in all the members, as to show that He is the true Son\\nof God. And no less beautiful than the Child is the Madonna, in\\nwhom, besides her supreme loveliness, there may be seen piety and\\ngladness. There is also a Joseph, who, leaning with both his hands\\non a staff, and lost in thoughtful contemplation of the King and\\nQueen of Heaven, gazes with the adoration of a most saintly old man.\\nBoth these pictures are exhibited on days of solemn festival.\\nBy this time Raffaello had acquired much fame in Rome; but, although\\nhis manner was graceful and held by all to be very beautiful, and\\ndespite the fact that he had seen so many antiquities in that city,\\nand was for ever studying, nevertheless he had not yet given thereby\\nto his figures that grandeur and majesty which he gave to them from\\nthat time onward. For it happened in those days that Michelagnolo\\nmade the terrifying outburst against the Pope in the chapel, of\\nwhich we will speak in his Life; whence he was forced to fly to\\nFlorence. Whereupon Bramante, having the keys of the chapel, allowed\\nRaffaello, who was his friend, to see it, to the end that he might\\nbe able to learn the methods of Michelagnolo. And the sight of it\\nwas the reason that Raffaello straightway repainted, although he had\\nalready finished it, the Prophet Isaiah that is to be seen in S.\\nAgostino at Rome, above the S. Anne by Andrea Sansovino; in which\\nwork, by means of what he had seen of Michelagnolo's painting, he\\nmade the manner immeasurably better and more grand, and gave it\\ngreater majesty. Wherefore Michelagnolo, on seeing afterwards the\\nwork of Raffaello, thought, as was the truth, that Bramante had done\\nhim that wrong on purpose in order to bring profit and fame to\\nRaffaello.\\nNot long after this, Agostino Chigi, a very rich merchant of Siena,\\nwho was much the friend of every man of excellence, gave Raffaello\\nthe commission to paint a chapel; and this he did because a short\\ntime before Raffaello had painted for him in his softest manner, in\\na loggia of his palace, now called the Chigi, in the Trastevere, a\\nGalatea in a car on the sea drawn by two dolphins, and surrounded by\\nTritons and many sea-gods. Raffaello, then, having made the cartoon\\nfor that chapel, which is at the entrance of the Church of S. Maria\\ndella Pace, on the right hand as one goes into the church by the\\nprincipal door, executed it in fresco, in his new manner, which was\\nno little grander and more magnificent than his earlier manner. In\\nthis painting Raffaello depicted some Prophets and Sibyls, before\\nMichelagnolo's chapel had been thrown open to view, although he had\\nseen it; and in truth it is held to be the best of his works, and\\nthe most beautiful among so many that are beautiful, for in the\\nwomen and children that are in it, there may be seen a marvellous\\nvivacity and perfect colouring. And this work caused him to be\\ngreatly esteemed both in his lifetime and after his death, being the\\nrarest and most excellent that Raffaello executed in all his life.\\nNext, spurred by the entreaties of a Chamberlain of Pope Julius, he\\npainted the panel for the high-altar of the Araceli, wherein he made\\na Madonna in the sky, with a most beautiful landscape, a S. John, a\\nS. Francis, and a S. Jerome represented as a Cardinal; in which\\nMadonna may be seen a humility and a modesty truly worthy of the\\nMother of Christ; and besides the beautiful gesture of the Child as\\nHe plays with His Mother's hand, there is revealed in S. John that\\npenitential air which fasting generally gives, while his head\\ndisplays the sincerity of soul and frank assurance appropriate to\\nthose who live away from the world and despise it, and, in their\\ndealings with mankind, make war on falsehood and speak out the\\ntruth. In like manner, the S. Jerome has his head uplifted with his\\neyes on the Madonna, deep in contemplation; and in them seem to be\\nsuggested all the learning and knowledge that he showed in his\\nwritings, while with both his hands he is presenting the\\nChamberlain, in the act of recommending him to her; which portrait\\nof the Chamberlain is as lifelike as any ever painted. Nor did\\nRaffaello fail to do as well in the figure of S. Francis, who,\\nkneeling on the ground, with one arm outstretched, and with his head\\nupraised, is gazing up at the Madonna, glowing with a love in tone\\nwith the feeling of the picture, which, both by the lineaments and\\nby the colouring, shows him melting with affection, and taking\\ncomfort and life from the gracious sight of her beauty and of the\\nvivacity and beauty of her Son. In the middle of the panel, below\\nthe Madonna, Raffaello made a little boy standing, who is raising\\nhis head towards her and holding an inscription: than whom none\\nbetter or more graceful could be painted, what with the beauty of\\nhis features and the proportionate loveliness of his person. And in\\naddition there is a landscape, which is singularly beautiful in its\\nabsolute perfection.\\nAfterwards, going on with the apartments of the Palace, he painted a\\nscene of the Miracle of the Sacramental Corporal of Orvieto, or of\\nBolsena, whichever it may be called. In this scene there may be\\nperceived in the face of the priest who is saying Mass, which is\\nglowing with a blush, the shame that he felt on seeing the Host\\nturned into blood on the Corporal on account of his unbelief. With\\nterror in his eyes, dumbfoundered and beside himself in the presence\\nof his hearers, he seems like one who knows not what to do; and in\\nthe gesture of his hands may almost be seen the fear and trembling\\nthat a man would feel in such a case. Round him Raffaello made many\\nfigures, all varied and different, some serving the Mass, others\\nkneeling on a flight of steps; and all, bewildered by the\\nstrangeness of the event, are making various most beautiful\\nmovements and gestures, while in many, both men and women, there is\\nrevealed a belief that they are to blame. Among the women is one who\\nis seated on the ground at the foot of the scene, holding a child in\\nher arms; and she, hearing the account that another appears to be\\ngiving her of the thing that has happened to the priest, turns in a\\nmarvellous manner as she listens to this, with a womanly grace that\\nis very natural and lifelike. On the other side he painted Pope\\nJulius hearing that Mass, a most marvellous work, wherein he made a\\nportrait of Cardinal di San Giorgio, with innumerable others; and\\nthe window-opening he turned to advantage by making a flight of\\nsteps, in such a way that all the painting seems to be one whole:\\nnay, it appears as if, were that window-space not there, the work\\nwould in nowise have been complete. Wherefore it may be truly\\ncredited to him that in the invention and composition of every kind\\nof painted story, no one has ever been more dexterous, facile, and\\nable than Raffaello.\\nThis he also proved in another scene in the same place, opposite to\\nthe last-named, of S. Peter in the hands of Herod, and guarded in\\nprison by men-at-arms; wherein he showed such a grasp of\\narchitecture, and such judgment in the buildings of the prison, that\\nin truth the others after him seem to have more confusion than he\\nhas beauty. For he was ever seeking to represent stories just as\\nthey are written, and to paint in them things gracious and\\nexcellent; as is proved in this one by the horror of the prison,\\nwherein that old man is seen bound in chains of iron between the two\\nmen-at-arms, by the deep slumber of the guards, and by the dazzling\\nsplendour of the Angel, which, in the thick darkness of the night,\\nreveals with its light every detail of the prison, and makes the\\narms of the soldiers shine resplendent, in such a way that their\\nburnished lustre seems more lifelike than if they were real,\\nalthough they are only painted. No less art and genius are there in\\nthe action of S. Peter, when, freed from his chains, he goes forth\\nfrom the prison, accompanied by the Angel, wherein one sees in the\\nface of the Saint a belief that it is rather a dream than a reality;\\nand so, also, terror and dismay are shown in some other armed guards\\nwithout the prison, who hear the noise of the iron door, while a\\nsentinel with a torch in his hand rouses the others, and, as he\\ngives them light with it, the blaze of the torch is reflected in all\\ntheir armour; and all that its glow does not reach is illumined by\\nthe light of the moon. This composition Raffaello painted over the\\nwindow, where the wall is darkest; and thus, when you look at the\\npicture, the light strikes you in the face, and the real light\\nconflicts so well with the different lights of the night in the\\npainting, that the smoke of the torch, the splendour of the Angel,\\nand the thick darkness of the night seem to you to be wholly real\\nand natural, and you would never say that it was all painted, so\\nvividly did he express this difficult conception. In it are seen\\nshadows playing on the armour, other shadows projected, reflections,\\nand a vaporous glare from the lights, all executed with darkest\\nshade, and so well, that it may be truly said that he was the master\\nof every other master; and as an effect of night, among all those\\nthat painting has ever produced, this is the most real and most\\ndivine, and is held by all the world to be the rarest.\\nOn one of the unbroken walls, also, he painted the Divine Worship\\nand the Ark of the Hebrews, with the Candlestick; and likewise Pope\\nJulius driving Avarice out of the Temple, a scene as beautiful and\\nas excellent as the Night described above. Here, in some bearers who\\nare carrying Pope Julius, a most lifelike figure, in his chair, are\\nportraits of men who were living at that time. And while the people,\\nsome women among them, are making way for the Pope, so that he may\\npass, one sees the furious onset of an armed man on horseback, who,\\naccompanied by two on foot, and in an attitude of the greatest\\nfierceness, is smiting and riding down the proud Heliodorus, who is\\nseeking, at the command of Antiochus, to rob the Temple of all the\\nwealth stored for the widows and orphans. Already the riches and\\ntreasures could be seen being removed and taken away, when, on\\naccount of the terror of the strange misfortune of Heliodorus, so\\nrudely struck down and smitten by the three figures mentioned above\\n(although, this being a vision, they are seen and heard by him\\nalone), behold, they are all dropped and upset on the ground, those\\nwho were carrying them falling down through the sudden terror and\\npanic that had come upon all the following of Heliodorus. Apart from\\nthese may be seen the holy Onias, the High Priest, dressed in his\\nrobes of office, with his eyes and hands raised to Heaven, and\\npraying most fervently, being seized with pity for the poor\\ninnocents who were thus nearly losing their possessions, and\\nrejoicing at the help that he feels has come down from on high.\\nBesides this, through a beautiful fancy of Raffaello's, one sees\\nmany who have climbed on to the socles of the column-bases, and,\\nclasping the shafts, stand looking in most uncomfortable attitudes;\\nwith a throng of people showing their amazement in many various\\nways, and awaiting the result of this event.\\nThis work is in every part so stupendous, that even the cartoons are\\nheld in the greatest veneration; wherefore Messer Francesco Masini,\\na gentleman of Cesena--who, without the help of any master, but\\ngiving his attention by himself from his earliest childhood, guided\\nby an extraordinary instinct of nature, to drawing and painting, has\\npainted pictures that have been much extolled by good judges of\\nart--possesses, among his many drawings and some ancient reliefs in\\nmarble, certain pieces of the cartoon which Raffaello made for this\\nstory of Heliodorus, and he holds them in the estimation that they\\ntruly deserve. Nor will I refrain from saying that Messer Niccolò\\nMasini, who has given me information about these matters, is as much\\na true lover of our arts as he is a man of real culture in all other\\nthings.\\nBut to return to Raffaello; on the ceiling above these works, he\\nthen executed four scenes, God appearing to Abraham and promising\\nhim the multiplication of his seed, the Sacrifice of Isaac, Jacob's\\nLadder, and the Burning Bush of Moses: wherein may be recognized no\\nless art, invention, draughtsmanship, and grace, than in the other\\nworks that he painted.\\nWhile the happy genius of this craftsman was producing such marvels,\\nthe envy of fortune cut short the life of Julius II, who had\\nfostered such abilities, and had been a lover of every excellent\\nwork. Whereupon a new Pope was elected in Leo X, who desired that\\nthe work begun should be carried on; and Raffaello thereby soared\\nwith his genius into the heavens, and received endless favours from\\nhim, fortunate in having come upon a Prince so great, who had by the\\ninheritance of blood a strong inclination for such an art.\\nRaffaello, therefore, thus encouraged to pursue the work, painted on\\nthe other wall the Coming of Attila to Rome, and his encounter at\\nthe foot of Monte Mario with Leo III, who drove him away with his\\nmere benediction. In this scene Raffaello made S. Peter and S. Paul\\nin the air, with swords in their hands, coming to defend the Church;\\nand while the story of Leo III says nothing of this, nevertheless it\\nwas thus that he chose to represent it, perchance out of fancy, for\\nit often happens that painters, like poets, go straying from their\\nsubject in order to make their work the more ornate, although their\\ndigressions are not such as to be out of harmony with their first\\nintention. In those Apostles may be seen that celestial wrath and\\nardour which the Divine Justice is wont often to impart to the\\nfeatures of its ministers, charged with defending the most holy\\nFaith; and of this we have proof in Attila, who is to be seen riding\\na black horse with white feet and a star on its forehead, as\\nbeautiful as it could be, for in an attitude of the utmost terror he\\nthrows up his head and turns his body in flight. There are other\\nmost beautiful horses, particularly a dappled jennet, which is\\nridden by a figure that has all the body covered with scales after\\nthe manner of a fish; which is copied from the Column of Trajan,\\nwherein the figures have armour of that kind; and it is thought that\\nsuch armour is made from the skins of crocodiles. There is Monte\\nMario, all aflame, showing that when soldiers march away, their\\nquarters are always left a prey to fire. He made portraits from\\nnature, also, in some mace-bearers accompanying the Pope, who are\\nmarvellously lifelike, as are the horses on which they are riding;\\nand the same is true of the retinue of Cardinals, and of some grooms\\nwho are holding the palfrey on which rides the Pope in full\\npontificals (a portrait of Leo X, no less lifelike than those of the\\nothers), with many courtiers; the whole being a most pleasing\\nspectacle and well in keeping with such a work, and also very useful\\nto our art, particularly for those who have no such objects at their\\ncommand.\\nAt this same time he painted a panel containing Our Lady, S. Jerome\\nrobed as a Cardinal, and an Angel Raphael accompanying Tobias, which\\nwas placed in S. Domenico at Naples, in that chapel wherein is the\\nCrucifix that spoke to S. Thomas Aquinas. For Signor Leonello da\\nCarpi, Lord of Meldola, who is still alive, although more than\\nninety years old, he executed a picture that was most marvellous in\\ncolouring, and of a singular beauty, for it is painted with such\\nforce, and also with a delicacy so pleasing, that I do not think it\\nis possible to do better. In the countenance of the Madonna may be\\nseen such a divine air, and in her attitude such a dignity, that no\\none would be able to improve her; and he made her with the hands\\nclasped, adoring her Son, who is seated on her knees, caressing a S.\\nJohn, a little boy, who is adoring Him, in company with S. Elizabeth\\nand Joseph. This picture was once in the possession of the very\\nreverend Cardinal da Carpi, the son of the said Signor Leonello, and\\na great lover of our arts; and it should be at the present day in\\nthe hands of his heirs.\\nAfterwards, Lorenzo Pucci, Cardinal of Santi Quattro, having been\\ncreated Grand Penitentiary, Raffaello was favoured by him with a\\ncommission to paint a panel for S. Giovanni in Monte at Bologna,\\nwhich is now set up in the chapel wherein lies the body of the\\nBlessed Elena dall' Olio: in which work it is evident how much\\ngrace, in company with art, could accomplish by means of the\\ndelicate hands of Raffaello. In it is a S. Cecilia, who, entranced\\nby a choir of angels on high, stands listening to the sound, wholly\\nabsorbed in the harmony; and in her countenance is seen that\\nabstraction which is found in the faces of those who are in ecstasy.\\nScattered about the ground, moreover, are musical instruments, which\\nhave the appearance of being, not painted, but real and true; and\\nsuch, also, are some veils that she is wearing, with vestments woven\\nin silk and gold, and, below these, a marvellous hair-shirt. And in\\na S. Paul, who has the right arm leaning on his naked sword, and the\\nhead resting on the hand, one sees his profound air of knowledge, no\\nless well expressed than the transformation of his pride of aspect\\ninto dignity. He is clothed in a simple red garment by way of\\nmantle, below which is a green tunic, after the manner of the\\nApostles, and his feet are bare. There is also S. Mary Magdalene,\\nwho is holding in her hands a most delicate vase of stone, in an\\nattitude of marvellous grace; turning her head, she seems full of\\njoy at her conversion; and indeed, in that kind of painting, I do\\nnot think that anything better could be done. Very beautiful,\\nlikewise, are the heads of S. Augustine and S. John the Evangelist.\\nOf a truth, other pictures may be said to be pictures, but those of\\nRaffaello life itself, for in his figures the flesh quivers, the\\nvery breath may be perceived, the pulse beats, and the true\\npresentment of life is seen in them; on which account this picture\\ngave him, in addition to the fame that he had already, an even\\ngreater name. Wherefore many verses were written in his honour, both\\nLatin and in the vulgar tongue, of which, in order not to make my\\nstory longer than I have set out to do, I will cite only the\\nfollowing:\\n  Pingant sola alii referantque coloribus ora;\\n  Cæciliæ os Raphael atque animum explicuit.\\nAfter this he also painted a little picture with small figures,\\nwhich is likewise at Bologna, in the house of Count Vincenzio\\nErcolano, containing a Christ after the manner of Jove in Heaven,\\nsurrounded by the four Evangelists as Ezekiel describes them, one in\\nthe form of a man, another as a lion, the third an eagle, and the\\nfourth an ox, with a little landscape below to represent the earth:\\nwhich work, in its small proportions, is no less rare and beautiful\\nthan his others in their greatness.\\nTo the Counts of Canossa in Verona he sent a large picture of equal\\nexcellence, in which is a very beautiful Nativity of Our Lord, with\\na daybreak that is much extolled, as is also the S. Anne, and,\\nindeed, the whole work, which cannot be more highly praised than by\\nsaying that it is by the hand of Raffaello da Urbino. Wherefore\\nthose Counts rightly hold it in supreme veneration, nor have they\\never consented, for all the vast prices that have been offered to\\nthem by many Princes, to sell it to anyone.\\nFor Bindo Altoviti, he made a portrait of him when he was a young\\nman, which is held to be extraordinary; and likewise a picture of\\nOur Lady, which he sent to Florence, and which is now in the Palace\\nof Duke Cosimo, in the chapel of the new apartments, which were\\nbuilt and painted by me, where it serves as altar-piece. In it is\\npainted a very old S. Anne, seated, and holding out to Our Lady her\\nSon, the features of whose countenance, as well as the whole of His\\nnude form, are so beautiful that with His smile He rejoices whoever\\nbeholds Him; besides which, Raffaello depicted, in painting the\\nMadonna, all the beauty that can be imparted to the aspect of a\\nVirgin, with the complement of chaste humility in the eyes, honour\\nin the brow, grace in the nose, and virtue in the mouth; not to\\nmention that her raiment is such as to reveal infinite simplicity\\nand dignity. And, indeed, I do not think that there is anything\\nbetter to be seen than this whole work. There is a nude S. John,\\nseated, with a female saint, who is likewise very beautiful; and for\\nbackground there is a building, in which he painted a linen-covered\\nwindow that gives light to the room wherein are the figures.\\nIn Rome he made a picture of good size, in which he portrayed Pope\\nLeo, Cardinal Giulio de' Medici, and Cardinal de' Rossi. In this the\\nfigures appear to be not painted, but in full relief; there is the\\npile of the velvet, with the damask of the Pope's vestments shining\\nand rustling, the fur of the linings soft and natural, and the gold\\nand silk so counterfeited that they do not seem to be in colour, but\\nreal gold and silk. There is an illuminated book of parchment, which\\nappears more real than the reality; and a little bell of wrought\\nsilver, which is more beautiful than words can tell. Among other\\nthings, also, is a ball of burnished gold on the Pope's chair,\\nwherein are reflected, as if it were a mirror (such is its\\nbrightness), the light from the windows, the shoulders of the Pope,\\nand the walls round the room. And all these things are executed with\\nsuch diligence, that one may believe without any manner of doubt\\nthat no master is able, or is ever likely to be able, to do better.\\nFor this work the Pope was pleased to reward him very richly; and\\nthe picture is still to be seen in Florence, in the guardaroba of\\nthe Duke. In like manner he executed portraits of Duke Lorenzo and\\nDuke Giuliano, with a perfect grace of colouring not achieved by any\\nother than himself, which are in the possession of the heirs of\\nOttaviano de' Medici at Florence.\\nThereupon there came to Raffaello a great increase of glory, and\\nlikewise of rewards; and for this reason, in order to leave some\\nmemorial of himself, he caused a palace to be built in the Borgo\\nNuovo at Rome, which Bramante executed with castings. Now, the fame\\nof this most noble craftsman, by reason of the aforesaid works and\\nmany others, having passed into France and Flanders, Albrecht Dürer,\\na most marvellous German painter, and an engraver of very beautiful\\ncopperplates, rendered tribute to Raffaello out of his own works,\\nand sent to him a portrait of himself, a head, executed by him in\\ngouache on a cloth of fine linen, which showed the same on either\\nside, the lights being transparent and obtained without lead-white,\\nwhile the only grounding and colouring was done with water-colours,\\nthe white of the cloth serving for the ground of the bright parts.\\nThis work seemed to Raffaello to be marvellous, and he sent him,\\ntherefore, many drawings executed by his own hand, which were\\nreceived very gladly by Albrecht. That head was among the\\npossessions of Giulio Romano, the heir of Raffaello, in Mantua.\\nRaffaello, having thus seen the manner of the engravings of Albrecht\\nDürer, and desiring on his own behalf to show what could be done\\nwith his work by such an art, caused Marc' Antonio Bolognese to make\\na very thorough study of the method; and that master became so\\nexcellent, that Raffaello commissioned him to make prints of his\\nfirst works, such as the drawing of the Innocents, a Last Supper,\\nthe Neptune, and the S. Cecilia being boiled in oil. Marc' Antonio\\nafterwards made for Raffaello a number of other engravings, which\\nRaffaello finally gave to Baviera, his assistant, who had charge of\\na mistress whom Raffaello loved to the day of his death. Of her he\\nmade a very beautiful portrait, wherein she seemed wholly alive: and\\nthis is now in Florence, in the possession of that most gentle of\\nmen, Matteo Botti, a Florentine merchant, and an intimate friend of\\nevery able person, and particularly of painters, who treasures it\\nas a relic, on account of the love that he bears to art, and above\\nall to Raffaello. And no less esteem is shown to the works of our\\narts and to the craftsmen by his brother, Simon Botti, who, besides\\nbeing held by us all to be one of the most loving spirits that show\\nfavour to the men of our professions, is held in estimation by me in\\nparticular as the best and greatest friend that ever man loved after\\na long experience; not to mention the good judgment that he has and\\nshows in matters of art.\\nBut to return to the engravings; the favour shown by Raffaello to\\nBaviera was the reason that there afterwards sprang up Marco da\\nRavenna and a host of others, insomuch that the dearth of copper\\nengravings was changed into that abundance that we see at the\\npresent day. Thereupon Ugo da Carpi, having a brain inclined to\\ningenious and fanciful things, and showing beautiful invention,\\ndiscovered the method of wood-engraving, whereby, with three blocks,\\ngiving the middle values, the lights, and the shadows, it is\\npossible to imitate drawings in chiaroscuro, which was certainly a\\nthing of beautiful and fanciful invention; and from this, also,\\nthere afterwards came an abundance of prints, as will be related\\nwith greater detail in the Life of Marc' Antonio Bolognese.\\nRaffaello then painted for the Monastery of the Monks of Monte\\nOliveto, called S. Maria dello Spasmo, at Palermo, a panel-picture\\nof Christ bearing the Cross, which is held to be a marvellous work.\\nIn this may be seen the impious ministers of the Crucifixion,\\nleading Him with wrath and fury to His death on Mount Calvary; and\\nChrist, broken with agony at the near approach of death, has fallen\\nto the ground under the weight of the Tree of the Cross, and, bathed\\nwith sweat and blood, turns towards the Maries, who are in a storm\\nof weeping. Moreover, there is seen among them Veronica, who\\nstretches out her arms and offers Him a cloth, with an expression of\\nthe tenderest love, not to mention that the work is full of\\nmen-at-arms both on horseback and on foot, who are pouring forth\\nfrom the gate of Jerusalem with the standards of justice in their\\nhands, in various most beautiful attitudes. This panel, when\\ncompletely finished, but not yet brought to its resting-place, was\\nvery near coming to an evil end, for the story goes that after it\\nhad been put on shipboard, in order that it might be carried to\\nPalermo, a terrible storm dashed against a rock the ship that was\\ncarrying it, in such a manner that the timbers broke asunder, and\\nall the men were lost, together with the merchandise, save only the\\npanel, which, safely packed in its case, was washed by the sea on to\\nthe shore of Genoa. There, having been fished up and drawn to land,\\nit was found to be a thing divine, and was put into safe keeping;\\nfor it had remained undamaged and without any hurt or blemish, since\\neven the fury of the winds and the waves of the sea had respect for\\nthe beauty of such a work. The news of this being then bruited\\nabroad, the monks took measures to recover it, and no sooner had it\\nbeen restored to them, by the favour of the Pope, than they gave\\nsatisfaction, and that liberally, to those who had rescued it.\\nThereupon it was once more put on board ship and brought at last to\\nSicily, where they set it up in Palermo; in which place it has more\\nfame and reputation than the Mount of Vulcan itself.\\nWhile Raffaello was engaged on these works, which, having to gratify\\ngreat and distinguished persons, he could not refuse to\\nundertake--not to mention that his own private interests prevented\\nhim from saying them nay--yet for all this he never ceased to carry\\non the series of pictures that he had begun in the Papal apartments\\nand halls; wherein he always kept men who pursued the work from his\\nown designs, while he himself, continually supervising everything,\\nlent to so vast an enterprise the aid of the best efforts of which\\nhe was capable. No long time passed, therefore, before he threw open\\nthat apartment of the Borgia Tower in which he had painted a scene\\non every wall, two above the windows, and two others on the unbroken\\nwalls. In one was the Burning of the Borgo Vecchio of Rome, when,\\nall other methods having failed to put out the fire, S. Leo IV\\npresents himself at the Loggia of his Palace and extinguishes it\\ncompletely with his benediction. In this scene are represented\\nvarious perils. On one side are women who are bearing vessels filled\\nwith water in their hands and on their heads, whereby to extinguish\\nthe flames; and their hair and draperies are blown about by the\\nterrible fury of a tempestuous wind. Others, who are seeking to\\nthrow water on the fire, are blinded by the smoke and wholly\\nbewildered. On the other side, after the manner of Virgil's story\\nof Anchises being carried by Æneas, is shown an old sick man,\\novercome by his infirmity and the flames of the fire; and in the\\nfigure of the young man are seen courage and strength, and great\\neffort in all his limbs under the weight of the old man, who lies\\nhelpless on the young man's back. He is followed by an old woman\\nwith bare feet and disordered garments, who is flying from the fire;\\nand a little naked boy runs before them. On the top of some ruins,\\nlikewise, may be seen a naked woman, with hair all dishevelled, who\\nhas her child in her hands and is throwing him to a man of her\\nhouse, who, having escaped from the flames, is standing in the\\nstreet on tiptoe, with arms outstretched to receive the child\\nwrapped in swathing-bands; wherein the eager anxiety of the woman to\\nsave her son may be recognized no less clearly than her torment in\\nthe peril of the fierce flames, which are already licking around\\nher. And no less suffering is evident in him who is receiving the\\nchild, both for its sake and on account of his own fear of death.\\nNor is it possible to describe the imagination that this most\\ningenious and most marvellous craftsman showed in a mother with her\\nfeet bare, her garments in disorder, her girdle unbound, and her\\nhair dishevelled, who has gathered her children before her and is\\ndriving them on, holding part of her clothing in one hand, that they\\nmay escape from the ruins and from that blazing furnace; not to\\nmention that there are also some women who, kneeling before the\\nPope, appear to be praying to his Holiness that he should make the\\nfire cease.\\nThe next scene is from the life of the same S. Leo IV, wherein\\nRaffaello depicted the port of Ostia occupied by the fleet of the\\nTurks, who had come to take the Pope prisoner. The Christians may be\\nseen fighting against that fleet on the sea; and already there has\\ncome to the harbour an endless number of prisoners, who are\\ndisembarking from a boat and being dragged by the beard by some\\nsoldiers, who are very beautiful in features and most spirited in\\ntheir attitudes. The prisoners, dressed in the motley garb of\\ngalley-slaves, are being led before S. Leo, whose figure is a\\nportrait of Pope Leo X. Here Raffaello painted his Holiness in\\npontificals, between Cardinal Santa Maria in Portico, who was\\nBernardo Divizio of Bibbiena, and Cardinal Giulio de' Medici, who\\nafterwards became Pope Clement. Nor is it possible to describe in\\ndetail the beautiful conceptions that this most ingenious craftsman\\nshowed in the expressions of the prisoners, wherein one can\\nrecognize, without speech, their grief and the fear of death.\\nIn the first of the other two scenes is Pope Leo X consecrating the\\nmost Christian King, Francis I of France, chanting the Mass in his\\npontificals, and blessing the oil for the anointing of the King, and\\nlikewise the royal crown. There, besides the great number of\\nCardinals and Bishops in their robes, who are assisting, he\\nportrayed from life many Ambassadors and other persons, and also\\nsome figures dressed in the French fashion, according to the style\\nof that time. In the other scene he painted the Crowning of the same\\nKing, wherein are portraits from life of the Pope and of Francis,\\none in armour and the other in his pontificals; besides which, all\\nthe Cardinals, Bishops, Chamberlains, Esquires, and Grooms of the\\nChamber are seated in due order in their places, as is the custom in\\nthe chapel, all in their robes and portrayed from life, among them\\nbeing Giannozzo Pandolfini, Bishop of Troia, a close friend of\\nRaffaello, with many others who were distinguished at that time.\\nNear the King is a little boy kneeling, who is holding the royal\\ncrown--a portrait of Ippolito de' Medici, who afterwards became\\nCardinal and Vice-Chancellor, a man of great repute, and much the\\nfriend not only of this art, but of all others, to whose blessed\\nmemory I acknowledge a vast obligation, seeing that my first steps,\\nsuch as they were, were taken under his auspices.\\nIt is not possible to write of every detail in the works of this\\ncraftsman, wherein every least thing, although dumb, appears to have\\nspeech: save only of the bases executed below these pictures, with\\nvarious figures of defenders and benefactors of the Church, and\\nvarious terminal figures on either side of them, the whole being\\nwrought in such a manner that everything reveals spirit, feeling,\\nand thought, and with such a harmony and unity of colouring that\\nnothing better can be conceived. And since the ceiling of that\\napartment had been painted by Pietro Perugino, his master, Raffaello\\nwould not destroy it, moved by respect for his memory and by the\\nlove that he bore to the man who had been the origin of the rank\\nthat he held in his art.\\nSuch was the greatness of this master, that he kept designers all\\nover Italy, at Pozzuolo, and even in Greece; and he was for ever\\nsearching out everything of the good that might help his art.\\nNow, continuing his work, he also painted a hall, wherein were some\\nfigures of the Apostles and other saints in tabernacles, executed in\\nterretta; and there he caused to be made by Giovanni da Udine, his\\ndisciple, who has no equal in the painting of animals, all the\\nanimals that Pope Leo possessed, such as the chameleon, the\\ncivet-cats, the apes, the parrots, the lions, the elephants, and\\nother beasts even more strange. And besides embellishing the Palace\\ngreatly with grotesques and varied pavements, he also gave the\\ndesigns for the Papal staircases, as well as for the loggie begun by\\nthe architect Bramante, but left unfinished on account of his death,\\nand afterwards carried out with the new design and architecture of\\nRaffaello, who made for this a model of wood with better proportion\\nand adornment than had been accomplished by Bramante. The Pope\\nwishing to demonstrate the greatness and magnificence of his\\ngenerous ambition, Raffaello made the designs for the ornaments in\\nstucco and for the scenes that were painted there, and likewise for\\nthe compartments; and as for the stucco and the grotesques, he\\nplaced at the head of that work Giovanni da Udine, and the figures\\nhe entrusted to Giulio Romano, although that master worked but\\nlittle at them; and he also employed Giovanni Francesco, Il Bologna,\\nPerino del Vaga, Pellegrino da Modena, Vincenzio da San Gimignano,\\nand Polidoro da Caravaggio, with many other painters, who executed\\nscenes and figures and other things that were required throughout\\nthat work, which Raffaello caused to be completed with such\\nperfection, that he even sent to Florence for pavements by the hand\\nof Luca della Robbia. Wherefore it is certain that with regard to\\nthe paintings, the stucco-ornaments, the arrangement, or any of the\\nbeautiful inventions, no one would be able to execute or even to\\nimagine a more marvellous work; and its beauty was the reason that\\nRaffaello received the charge of all the works of painting and\\narchitecture that were in progress in the Palace.\\nIt is said that the courtesy of Raffaello was such that he prevailed\\nupon the masons, in order that he might accommodate his friends, not\\nto build the walls absolutely solid and unbroken, but to leave,\\nabove the old rooms below, various openings and spaces for the\\nstorage of barrels, flasks, and wood; which holes and spaces so\\nweakened the lower part of the masonry, that afterwards they had to\\nbe filled in, because the whole was beginning to show cracks. He\\ncommissioned Gian Barile to adorn all the doors and ceilings of\\nwoodwork with a good number of carvings, which he executed and\\nfinished with beautiful grace.\\nHe gave architectural designs for the Vigna of the Pope, and for\\nmany houses in the Borgo; in particular, for the Palace of Messer\\nGiovanni Battista dall' Aquila, which was a very beautiful work. He\\nalso designed one for the Bishop of Troia, who had it built in the\\nVia di S. Gallo at Florence. For the Black Friars of S. Sisto in\\nPiacenza, he painted the picture for their high-altar, containing\\nthe Madonna with S. Sisto and S. Barbara, a truly rare and\\nextraordinary work. He executed many pictures to be sent into\\nFrance, and in particular, for the King, a S. Michael fighting with\\nthe Devil, which was held to be a marvellous thing. In this work he\\npainted a fire-scarred rock, to represent the centre of the earth,\\nfrom the fissures of which were issuing sulphurous flames; and in\\nLucifer, whose scorched and burned limbs are painted with various\\ntints of flesh-colour, could be seen all the shades of anger that\\nhis venomous and swollen pride calls up against Him who overbears\\nthe greatness of him who is deprived of any kingdom where there\\nmight be peace, and doomed to suffer perpetual punishment. The\\nopposite may be perceived in the S. Michael, clad in armour of iron\\nand gold, who, although he is painted with a celestial air, yet has\\nvalour, force, and terror in his aspect, and has already thrown\\nLucifer down and hurled him backwards with his spear. In a word,\\nthis work was of such a kind that he won for it, and rightly, a most\\nhonourable reward from that King. He made portraits of Beatrice of\\nFerrara and other ladies, and in particular that of his own\\nmistress, with an endless number of others.\\nRaffaello was a very amorous person, delighting much in women, and\\never ready to serve them; which was the reason that, in the pursuit\\nof his carnal pleasures, he found his friends more complacent and\\nindulgent towards him than perchance was right. Wherefore, when his\\ndear friend Agostino Chigi commissioned him to paint the first\\nloggia in his palace, Raffaello was not able to give much attention\\nto his work, on account of the love that he had for his mistress; at\\nwhich Agostino fell into such despair, that he so contrived by means\\nof others, by himself, and in other ways, as to bring it about,\\nalthough only with difficulty, that this lady should come to live\\ncontinually with Raffaello in that part of the house where he was\\nworking; and in this manner the work was brought to completion. For\\nthis work he made all the cartoons, and he coloured many of the\\nfigures in fresco with his own hand. And on the ceiling he made the\\nCouncil of the Gods in Heaven, wherein, in the forms of the Gods,\\nare seen many vestments and lineaments copied from the antique, and\\nexecuted with very beautiful grace and draughtsmanship. In like\\nmanner he made the Marriage of Psyche, with ministers serving Jove,\\nand the Graces scattering flowers over the table. In the spandrels\\nof the vaulting he executed many scenes, in one of which is Mercury\\nwith his flute, who, as he flies, has all the appearance of\\ndescending from Heaven; and in another is Jove with an air of\\ncelestial dignity, kissing Ganymede; and in another, likewise, lower\\ndown, is the Car of Venus, and the Graces, with Mercury, drawing\\nPsyche up to Heaven; with many other scenes from the poets in the\\nother spandrels. And in the spherical triangles of the vaulting\\nabove the arches, between the spandrels, are many most beautiful\\nlittle boys in foreshortening, hovering in the air and carrying all\\nthe instruments of the gods; Jove's lightnings and thunderbolts, the\\nhelmet, sword, and shield of Mars, Vulcan's hammers, the club and\\nlion-skin of Hercules, the caduceus of Mercury, Pan's pipes, and the\\nagricultural rakes of Vertumnus. All are accompanied by animals\\nappropriate to their character; and the whole work, both as picture\\nand as poem, is truly beautiful. Round these scenes he caused\\nGiovanni da Udine to make a border of all kinds of flowers, foliage,\\nand fruits, in festoons, which are as beautiful as they could be.\\nRaffaello made the designs for the architecture of the stables of\\nthe Chigi, and the design for the chapel of the aforesaid Agostino\\nin S. Maria del Popolo, wherein, besides painting it, he made\\narrangements for the erection of a marvellous tomb, causing\\nLorenzetto, a sculptor of Florence, to execute two figures, which\\nare still in his house in the Macello de' Corbi at Rome; but the\\ndeath of Raffaello, followed by that of Agostino, brought it about\\nthat this work was given to Sebastiano Viniziano.\\nMeanwhile Raffaello had risen to such greatness, that Leo X ordained\\nthat he should set to work on the Great Hall on the upper floor,\\nwherein are the Victories of Constantine; and with this he made a\\nbeginning. A fancy likewise took the Pope to have some very rich\\ntapestries made in gold and floss-silk; whereupon Raffaello drew and\\ncoloured with his own hand, of the exact form and size, all the\\ncartoons, which were sent to Flanders to be woven; and the\\ntapestries, when finished, were brought to Rome. This work was\\nexecuted so marvellously, that it arouses astonishment in whoever\\nbeholds it, wondering how it could have been possible to weave the\\nhair and beards in such detail, and to give softness to the flesh\\nwith mere threads; and it is truly rather a miracle than the work of\\nhuman art, seeing that in these tapestries are animals, water, and\\nbuildings, all made in such a way that they seem to be not woven,\\nbut really wrought with the brush. The work cost 70,000 crowns, and\\nit is still preserved in the Papal Chapel.\\nFor Cardinal Colonna he painted a S. John on canvas, for which, on\\naccount of its beauty, that Cardinal had an extraordinary love; but\\nhappening to be attacked by illness, he was asked by Messer Jacopo\\nda Carpi, the physician who cured him, to give it to him as a\\npresent; and because of this desire of Messer Jacopo, to whom he\\nfelt himself very deeply indebted, he gave it up. It is now in the\\npossession of Francesco Benintendi, in Florence.\\nFor Giulio de' Medici, Cardinal and Vice-Chancellor, he painted a\\npanel-picture, to be sent into France, of the Transfiguration of\\nChrist, at which he laboured without ceasing, and brought it to the\\nhighest perfection with his own hand. In this scene he represented\\nChrist Transfigured on Mount Tabor, at the foot of which are the\\neleven Disciples awaiting Him. There may be seen a young man\\npossessed by a spirit, who has been brought thither in order that\\nChrist, after descending from the mountain, may deliver him; which\\nyoung man stretches himself out in a distorted attitude, crying\\nand rolling his eyes, and reveals his suffering in his flesh, his\\nveins, and the beat of his pulse, all infected by that malignant\\nspirit; and the colour of his flesh, as he makes those violent and\\nfearsome gestures, is very pale. This figure is supported by an old\\nman, who, having embraced him and taken heart, with his eyes wide\\nopen and the light shining in them, is raising his brows and\\nwrinkling his forehead, showing at one and the same time both\\nstrength and fear; gazing intently, however, at the Apostles, he\\nappears to be encouraging himself by trusting in them. Among many\\nwomen is one, the principal figure in that panel, who, having knelt\\ndown before the Apostles, and turning her head towards them,\\nstretches her arms in the direction of the maniac and points out his\\nmisery; besides which the Apostles, some standing, some seated, and\\nothers kneeling, show that they are moved to very great compassion\\nby such misfortune. And, indeed, he made therein figures and heads\\nso fine in their novelty and variety, to say nothing of their\\nextraordinary beauty, that it is the common opinion of all craftsmen\\nthat this work, among the vast number that he painted, is the most\\nglorious, the most lovely, and the most divine. For whoever wishes\\nto know how Christ Transfigured and made Divine should be\\nrepresented in painting, must look at this work, wherein Raffaello\\nmade Him in perspective over that mount, in a sky of exceeding\\nbrightness, with Moses and Elias, who, illumined by a dazzling\\nsplendour, burst into life in His light. Prostrate on the ground, in\\nattitudes of great beauty and variety, are Peter, James, and John;\\none has his head to the earth, and another, shading his eyes with\\nhis hands, is defending himself from the rays and intense light of\\nthe splendour of Christ. He, clothed in snow-white raiment, with His\\narms outstretched and His head raised, appears to reveal the Divine\\nessence and nature of all the Three Persons united and concentrated\\nin Himself by the perfect art of Raffaello, who seems to have\\nsummoned up all his powers in such a manner, in order to show the\\nsupreme force of his art in the countenance of Christ, that, after\\nfinishing this, the last work that he was to do, he never again\\ntouched a brush, being overtaken by death.\\nNow, having described the works of this most excellent craftsman,\\nbefore I come to relate other particulars of his life and death, I\\ndo not wish to grudge the labour of saying something, for the\\nbenefit of the men of our arts, about the various manners of\\nRaffaello. He, then, after having imitated in his boyhood the manner\\nof his master, Pietro Perugino, which he made much better in\\ndraughtsmanship, colouring, and invention, believed that he had done\\nenough; but he recognized, when he had reached a riper age, that he\\nwas still too far from the truth. For, after seeing the works of\\nLeonardo da Vinci, who had no peer in the expressions of heads both\\nof men and of women, and surpassed all other painters in giving\\ngrace and movement to his figures, he was left marvelling and\\namazed; and in a word, the manner of Leonardo pleasing him more than\\nany other that he had ever seen, he set himself to study it, and\\nabandoning little by little, although with great difficulty, the\\nmanner of Pietro, he sought to the best of his power and knowledge\\nto imitate that of Leonardo. But for all his diligence and study, in\\ncertain difficulties he was never able to surpass Leonardo; and\\nalthough it appears to many that he did surpass him in sweetness and\\nin a kind of natural facility, nevertheless he was by no means\\nsuperior to him in that sublime groundwork of conceptions and that\\ngrandeur of art in which few have been the peers of Leonardo. Yet\\nRaffaello came very near to him, more than any other painter, and\\nabove all in grace of colouring. But to return to Raffaello himself;\\nin time he found himself very much hindered and impeded by the\\nmanner that he had adopted from Pietro when he was quite young,\\nwhich he acquired with ease, since it was over-precise, dry, and\\nfeeble in draughtsmanship. His being unable to forget it was the\\nreason that he had great difficulty in learning the beauties of the\\nnude and the methods of difficult foreshortenings from the cartoon\\nthat Michelagnolo Buonarroti made for the Council Hall in Florence;\\nand another might have lost heart, believing that he had been\\npreviously wasting his time, and would never have achieved, however\\nlofty his genius, what Raffaello accomplished. But he, having purged\\nhimself of Pietro's manner, and having thoroughly freed himself of\\nit, in order to learn the manner of Michelagnolo, so full of\\ndifficulties in every part, was changed, as it were, from a master\\nonce again into a disciple; and he forced himself with incredible\\nstudy, when already a man, to do in a few months what might have\\ncalled for the tender age at which all things are best acquired, and\\nfor a space of many years. For in truth he who does not learn in\\ngood time right principles and the manner that he wishes to follow,\\nand does not proceed little by little to solve the difficulties of\\nthe arts by means of experience, seeking to understand every part,\\nand to put it into practice, can scarcely ever become perfect; and\\neven if he does, that can only be after a longer space of time and\\nmuch greater labour.\\nWhen Raffaello resolved to set himself to change and improve his\\nmanner, he had never given his attention to nudes with that zealous\\nstudy which is necessary, and had only drawn them from life in the\\nmanner that he had seen practised by his master Pietro, imparting to\\nthem the grace that he had from nature. He then devoted himself to\\nstudying the nude and to comparing the muscles of anatomical subjects\\nand of flayed human bodies with those of the living, which, being\\ncovered with skin, are not clearly defined, as they are when the skin\\nhas been removed; and going on to observe in what way they acquire the\\nsoftness of flesh in the proper places, and how certain graceful\\nflexures are produced by changing the point of view, and also the\\neffect of inflating, lowering, or raising either a limb or the whole\\nperson, and likewise the concatenation of the bones, nerves, and\\nveins, he became excellent in all the points that are looked for in a\\npainter of eminence. Knowing, however, that in this respect he could\\nnever attain to the perfection of Michelagnolo, he reflected, like a\\nman of supreme judgment, that painting does not consist only in\\nrepresenting the nude human form, but has a wider field; that one can\\nenumerate among the perfect painters those who express historical\\ninventions well and with facility, and who show fine judgment in their\\nfancies; and that he who, in the composition of scenes, can make them\\nneither confused with too much detail nor poor with too little, but\\ndistributed with beautiful invention and order, may also be called an\\nable and judicious craftsman. To this, as Raffaello was well aware,\\nmay be added the enriching those scenes with a bizarre variety of\\nperspectives, buildings, and landscapes, the method of clothing\\nfigures gracefully, the making them fade away sometimes in the\\nshadows, and sometimes come forward into the light, the imparting of\\nlife and beauty to the heads of women, children, young men and old,\\nand the giving them movement and boldness, according to necessity. He\\nconsidered, also, how important is the furious flight of horses in\\nbattles, fierceness in soldiers, the knowledge how to depict all the\\nsorts of animals, and above all the power to give such resemblance to\\nportraits that they seem to be alive, and that it is known whom they\\nrepresent; with an endless number of other things, such as the\\nadornment of draperies, foot-wear, helmets, armour, women's\\nhead-dresses, hair, beards, vases, trees, grottoes, rocks, fires,\\nskies turbid or serene, clouds, rain, lightning, clear weather, night,\\nthe light of the moon, the splendour of the sun, and innumerable other\\nthings, which are called for every moment by the requirements of the\\nart of painting. Pondering over these things, I say, Raffaello\\nresolved, since he could not approach Michelagnolo in that branch of\\nart to which he had set his hand, to seek to equal, and perchance to\\nsurpass him, in these others; and he devoted himself, therefore, not\\nto imitating the manner of that master, but to the attainment of a\\ncatholic excellence in the other fields of art that have been\\ndescribed. And if the same had been done by many craftsmen of our own\\nage, who, having determined to pursue the study of Michelagnolo's\\nworks alone, have failed to imitate him and have not been able to\\nreach his extraordinary perfection, they would not have laboured in\\nvain nor acquired a manner so hard, so full of difficulty, wanting in\\nbeauty and colouring, and poor in invention, but would have been able,\\nby aiming at catholicity and at imitation in the other fields of art,\\nto render service both to themselves and to the world.\\nRaffaello, then, having made this resolution, and having recognized\\nthat Fra Bartolommeo di San Marco had a passing good method of\\npainting, well-grounded draughtsmanship, and a pleasing manner of\\ncolouring, although at times, in order to obtain stronger relief, he\\nmade too much use of darks, took from him what appeared to him to\\nsuit his need and his fancy--namely, a middle course, both in\\ndrawing and in colouring; and mingling with that method certain\\nothers selected from the best work of other masters, out of many\\nmanners he made one, which was looked upon ever afterwards as his\\nown, and which was and always will be vastly esteemed by all\\ncraftsmen. This was then seen perfected in the Sibyls and Prophets\\nof the work that he executed, as has been related, in S. Maria della\\nPace; in the carrying out of which work he was greatly assisted by\\nhaving seen the paintings of Michelagnolo in the Chapel of the Pope.\\nAnd if Raffaello had remained content with this same manner, and had\\nnot sought to give it more grandeur and variety in order to prove\\nthat he had as good a knowledge of the nude as Michelagnolo, he\\nwould not have lost a part of the good name that he had acquired;\\nbut the nudes that he made in that apartment of the Borgia Tower\\nwhere there is the Burning of the Borgo, although they are fine, are\\nnot in every way excellent. In like manner, those that were painted\\nlikewise by him on the ceiling of the Palace of Agostino Chigi in\\nthe Trastevere did not give complete satisfaction, for they are\\nwanting in that grace and sweetness which were peculiar to\\nRaffaello; the reason of which, in great part, was the circumstance\\nthat he had them coloured by others after his design. However,\\nrepenting of this error, like a man of judgment, he resolved\\nafterwards to execute by himself, without assistance from others,\\nthe panel-picture of the Transfiguration of Christ that is in S.\\nPietro a Montorio, wherein are all those qualities which, as has\\nalready been described, are looked for and required in a good\\npicture. And if he had not employed in this work, as it were from\\ncaprice, printer's smoke-black, the nature of which, as has been\\nremarked many times, is to become ever darker with time, to the\\ninjury of the other colours with which it is mixed, I believe that\\nthe picture would still be as fresh as when he painted it; whereas\\nit now appears to be rather a mass of shadows than aught else.\\nI have thought fit, almost at the close of this Life, to make this\\ndiscourse, in order to show with what labour, study, and diligence\\nthis honoured craftsman always pursued his art; and even more for\\nthe sake of other painters, to the end that they may learn how to\\navoid those hindrances from which the wisdom and genius of Raffaello\\nwere able to deliver him. I must add this as well, that every man\\nshould be satisfied and contented with doing that work to which he\\nfeels himself drawn by a natural inclination, and should not seek,\\nout of emulation, to put his hand to that for which nature has not\\nadapted him; for otherwise he will labour in vain, and often to his\\nown shame and loss. Moreover, where striving is enough, no man\\nshould aim at super-striving, merely in order to surpass those\\nwho, by some great gift of nature, or by some special grace bestowed\\non them by God, have performed or are performing miracles in art;\\nfor the reason that he who is not suited to any particular work, can\\nnever reach, let him labour as he may, the goal to which another,\\nwith the assistance of nature, has attained with ease. Of this,\\namong the old craftsmen, we may see an example in Paolo Uccello,\\nwho, striving against the limitations of his powers, in order to\\nadvance, did nothing but go backwards. The same has been done in our\\nown day, no long time since, by Jacopo da Pontormo, and it has been\\nproved by the experience of many others, as we have shown before and\\nwill point out yet again. And this, perchance, happens because\\nHeaven always distributes its favours, to the end that every man may\\nrest content with that which falls to him.\\nBut now, having discoursed on these matters of art, perchance at\\ngreater length than was needful, let us return to the life and death\\nof Raffaello. He had a strait friendship with Cardinal Bernardo\\nDivizio of Bibbiena, who had importuned him for many years to take a\\nwife of his choosing; and Raffaello, while not directly refusing to\\nobey the wishes of the Cardinal, had yet put the matter off, saying\\nthat he would rather wait till three or four years had passed. This\\nterm came upon Raffaello when he was not expecting it, and he was\\nreminded by the Cardinal of his promise; whereupon, seeing himself\\nbound, like the courteous man that he was, he would not break his\\nword, and thus accepted as his wife a niece of that Cardinal. And\\nbecause he was always very ill content with this entanglement, he\\ncontinued to delay the matter in such a way that many months passed\\nwithout the marriage being brought to pass. But it was with no\\ndishonourable motive that he did this, for, having been so many\\nyears in the service of the Court, and being the creditor of Leo\\nfor a good sum, it had been hinted to him that when the hall on\\nwhich he was engaged was finished, the Pope proposed to reward him\\nfor his labours and abilities by giving him a red hat, of which he\\nhad already determined to distribute a good number, and some of them\\nto men of less merit than Raffaello.\\nMeanwhile, pursuing his amours in secret, Raffaello continued to\\ndivert himself beyond measure with the pleasures of love; whence it\\nhappened that, having on one occasion indulged in more than his\\nusual excess, he returned to his house in a violent fever. The\\nphysicians, therefore, believing that he had overheated himself, and\\nreceiving from him no confession of the excess of which he had been\\nguilty, imprudently bled him, insomuch that he was weakened and felt\\nhimself sinking; for he was in need rather of restoratives.\\nThereupon he made his will: and first, like a good Christian, he\\nsent his mistress out of the house, leaving her the means to live\\nhonourably. Next, he divided his possessions among his disciples,\\nGiulio Romano, whom he had always loved dearly, and the Florentine\\nGiovanni Francesco, called Il Fattore, with a priest of Urbino, his\\nkinsman, whose name I do not know. Then he gave orders that some of\\nhis wealth should be used for restoring with new masonry one of the\\nancient tabernacles in S. Maria Ritonda, and for making an altar,\\nwith a marble statue of Our Lady, in that church, which he chose as\\nhis place of repose and burial after death; and he left all the rest\\nto Giulio and Giovanni Francesco, appointing as executor of his will\\nMesser Baldassarre da Pescia, then Datary to the Pope. Finally, he\\nconfessed and was penitent, and ended the course of his life at the\\nage of thirty-seven, on the same day that he was born, which was\\nGood Friday. And even as he embellished the world with his talents,\\nso, it may be believed, does his soul adorn Heaven by its presence.\\nAs he lay dead in the hall where he had been working, there was\\nplaced at his head the picture of the Transfiguration, which he had\\nexecuted for Cardinal de' Medici; and the sight of that living\\npicture, in contrast with the dead body, caused the hearts of all\\nwho beheld it to burst with sorrow. That work, in memory of the loss\\nof Raffaello, was placed by the Cardinal on the high-altar of S.\\nPietro a Montorio; and on account of the nobility of his every\\naction, it was held ever afterwards in great estimation. His body\\nreceived that honourable burial which his noble spirit had deserved,\\nfor there was no craftsman who did not weep with sorrow and follow\\nhim to the grave. His death was also a great grief to the whole\\nCourt of the Pope, first because he had held in his lifetime the\\noffice of Groom of the Chamber, and likewise because he had been so\\ndear to the Pope that his loss caused him to weep bitterly.\\nO happy and blessed spirit, in that every man is glad to speak of\\nthee, to celebrate thy actions, and to admire every drawing that\\nthou didst leave to us! When this noble craftsman died, the art of\\npainting might well have died also, seeing that when he closed his\\neyes, she was left as it were blind. And now for us who have\\nsurvived him, it remains to imitate the good, nay, the supremely\\nexcellent method bequeathed to us by him as a pattern, and, as is\\ncalled for by his merit and our obligations, to hold a most grateful\\nremembrance of this in our minds, and to pay the highest honour to\\nhis memory with our lips. For in truth we have from him art,\\ncolouring, and invention harmonized and brought to such a pitch of\\nperfection as could scarcely be hoped for; nor may any intellect\\never think to surpass him. And in addition to this benefit that he\\nconferred on art, like a true friend to her, as long as he lived he\\nnever ceased to show how one should deal with great men, with those\\nof middle station, and with the lowest. And, indeed, among his\\nextraordinary gifts, I perceive one of such value that I for my part\\nam amazed at it, in that Heaven gave him the power to produce in our\\nart an effect wholly contrary to the nature of us painters, which\\nwas that our craftsmen--I do not mean only the lesser, but also\\nthose whose humour it was to be great persons; and of this humour\\nart creates a vast number--while working in company with Raffaello,\\nfelt themselves naturally united and in such accord, that all evil\\nhumours vanished at the sight of him, and every vile and base\\nthought fell away from their minds. Such unity was never greater at\\nany other time than his; and this happened because they were\\novercome both by his courtesy and by his art, and even more by the\\ngood disposition of his nature, which was so full of gentleness and\\nso overflowing with loving-kindness, that it was seen that the very\\nanimals, not to speak of men, honoured him. It is said that if\\nany painter who knew him, and even any who did not know him, asked\\nhim for some drawing that he needed, Raffaello would leave his own\\nwork in order to assist him. And he always kept a vast number of\\nthem employed, aiding them and teaching them with such a love as\\nmight have been the due rather of his own children than of\\nfellow-craftsmen; for which reason he was never seen to go to Court\\nwithout having with him, as he left his house, some fifty painters,\\nall able and excellent, who kept him company in order to do him\\nhonour. In short, he lived not like a painter, but like a prince.\\nWherefore, O art of painting, thou couldst then esteem thyself\\nindeed most blessed, in possessing a craftsman who, both with his\\ngenius and his virtues, exalted thee higher than Heaven! Truly happy\\nmightest thou call thyself, in that thy disciples, following in the\\nfootsteps of so great a man, have seen how life should be lived, and\\nhow important is the union of art and virtue, which, wedded in\\nRaffaello, had strength to prevail on the magnificent Julius II and\\nthe magnanimous Leo X, exalted as they were in rank and dignity, to\\nmake him their most intimate friend and show him all possible\\ngenerosity, insomuch that by their favour and by the wealth that\\nthey bestowed upon him, he was enabled to do vast honour both to\\nhimself and to art. Blessed, also, may be called all those who,\\nemployed in his service, worked under him, since whoever imitated\\nhim found that he had reached an honourable haven; and in like\\nmanner all those who imitate his labours in art will be honoured by\\nthe world, even as, by resembling him in uprightness of life, they\\nwill win rewards from Heaven.\\nRaffaello received from Bembo the following epitaph:\\n  D.

And, in truth, among\\nthe benefits that are derived from ability, one is that from\\nwhatever strange and distant region and from however barbarous and\\nunknown a race a man may come, be he who he may, if only he has a\\nmind adorned with ability and practises some ingenious craft with\\nhis hands, no sooner does he make his first appearance in each city\\nto which he turns his steps, demonstrating his worth, than the skill\\nof his hand works so powerfully, that his name, passing from lip to\\nlip, in a short time waxes great, and his qualities become very\\nhighly prized and honoured. And it happens often to a great number\\nof men, who have left their country far behind them, that they\\nchance upon nations that are lovers of ability and of foreigners,\\nwhere, by reason of their upright walk of life, they find themselves\\nrecognized and cherished in such a manner, that they forget the\\ncountry of their birth and choose a new one for their last\\nresting-place.\\nEven so was Arezzo chosen as a final home by Guglielmo, who, as a\\nyouth in France, applied himself to the art of design, and together\\nwith that gave attention to glass windows, in which he made figures\\nno less harmonious in colouring than if they had been painted with\\nthe greatest beauty and harmony in oils. While in his own country,\\npersuaded by the entreaties of certain of his friends, he was\\npresent at the slaying of one who was their enemy: on which account\\nhe was forced to assume the habit of a monk in the Order of S.\\nDominic in France, in order to escape the courts and the hand of\\njustice. But although he remained in that Order, yet he never\\nabandoned the study of art; nay, continuing it, he arrived at the\\nhighest perfection.\\nNow, by order of Pope Julius II, a commission was given to Bramante\\nda Urbino to have a number of glass windows made for the Palace;\\nwhereupon he, making inquiries about the most excellent craftsmen,\\nreceived information of many who were working at that craft, and\\namong them of some who were executing marvellous works in France;\\nand of these he saw a specimen through the French Ambassador who was\\nthen at the Court of his Holiness, and who had in the frame of a\\nwindow in his study a figure executed on a piece of white glass with\\na vast number of colours, fixed on the glass by the action of fire.\\nWherefore, by order of Bramante, a letter was written to France,\\ninviting them to come to Rome, and offering them good payments.\\nThereupon Maestro Claudio, a Frenchman, the head of that art, having\\nreceived the intelligence, and knowing the excellence of Guglielmo,\\nso went to work with money and fair promises, that it was no\\ndifficult matter to draw him out of the convent, particularly\\nbecause Guglielmo, on account of the discourtesy shown to him and\\nthe jealousies that there always are among monks, was even more\\neager to leave it than was Maestro Claudio to get him out. They\\nwent, therefore, to Rome, where the habit of S. Dominic was changed\\nfor that of S. Peter.\\nBramante at that time had caused two windows of travertine to be made in\\nthe Palace of the Pope, which were in the hall in front of the chapel,\\nnow embellished by a vaulted ceiling by Antonio da San Gallo, and by\\nmarvellous stucco-work from the hand of Perino del Vaga of Florence.\\nThese windows were executed by Maestro Claudio and Guglielmo, although\\nafterwards, during the sack of Rome, they were broken to pieces, in\\norder to extract the lead to make harquebus-balls; and they were truly\\nmarvellous. In addition to these, they made an endless number of them\\nfor the apartments of the Pope, which met with the same fate as the\\nother two. And even now there is one to be seen in the room containing\\nRaffaello's Burning of the Borgo, in the Borgia Tower; in which are\\nangels who are holding the escutcheon of Leo X. They also made two\\nwindows for the chapel behind the Madonna in S. Maria del Popolo, with\\nthe stories of her life, which were highly praiseworthy examples of that\\ncraft.\\nThese works brought them no less fame and renown than comfort in\\nlife. But Maestro Claudio, being very intemperate in eating and\\ndrinking, according to the custom of his race, which is a deadly\\nthing in the air of Rome, fell sick of so violent a fever, that in\\nsix days he passed to the other life. Whereupon Guglielmo, left\\nalone, and almost like one lost without his companion, painted by\\nhimself a window, likewise of glass, in S. Maria de Anima, the\\nchurch of the Germans in Rome; which was the reason that Cardinal\\nSilvio of Cortona made him an offer, and made a contract with him\\nthat he should execute some windows and other works in his native\\ncity of Cortona. Wherefore the Cardinal took him in his company to\\ntake up his abode in Cortona; and the first work that he executed\\nwas the façade of the Cardinal's house on the side towards the\\nPiazza, which he painted in chiaroscuro, depicting therein Croton\\nand the other original founders of that city. Thereupon the\\nCardinal, who saw that Guglielmo was no less upright as a man than\\nexcellent as a master of that art, caused him to execute, for the\\nPieve of Cortona, the window of the principal chapel, in which he\\nmade the Nativity of Christ and the Magi adoring Him.\\nGuglielmo was a man of fine spirit and intelligence, and of very\\ngreat mastery in handling glass, and particularly in so distributing\\nthe colours that the brightest should come in the foremost figures,\\nthose in the other figures being darker in proportion as they\\nreceded; in which point he was a rare and truly excellent master.\\nMoreover, he showed very good judgment in the painting of his\\nfigures; whereby he executed them with such unity, that they fell\\nback into the distance little by little, in such a way that they did\\nnot cling either to the buildings or to the landscapes, and had the\\nappearance of being painted on panel, or rather in relief. He showed\\ninvention and variety in the composition of scenes, making them\\nrich and well grouped; and he rendered easy the process of making\\nsuch pictures as are put together out of pieces of glass, which was\\nheld to be very difficult, as indeed it is for one who has not his\\nskill and dexterity. He designed the pictures for his windows with\\nsuch good method and order, that the mountings of lead and iron,\\nwhich cross them in certain places, were so well fitted into the\\njoinings of the figures and the folds of the draperies, that they\\ncannot be seen--nay, they gave the whole such grace, that the brush\\ncould not have done more--and thus he was able to make a virtue of\\nnecessity.\\nGuglielmo used only two kinds of colour for the shading of such\\nglass as he proposed to subject to the action of fire; one was scale\\nof iron, and the other scale of copper. That of iron, which is dark,\\nserved to shade draperies, hair, and buildings; and the other, that\\nof copper, which produces a tawny tint, served for flesh colours. He\\nalso made much use of a hard stone that comes from Flanders and\\nFrance, called at the present day hematite, which is red in colour\\nand is much employed for burnishing gold. This, having first been\\npounded in a bronze mortar, and then ground with an iron brazing\\ninstrument on a plate of copper or yellow brass, and tempered with\\ngum, works divinely well on glass.\\nWhen Guglielmo first arrived in Rome, he was no great draughtsman,\\nalthough he was well practised in every other respect. But having\\nrecognized the need of this, he applied himself to the study of\\ndrawing, in spite of his being well advanced in years; and thus\\nlittle by little he achieved the improvement that is evident in the\\nwindows that he afterwards made for the Palace of the said Cardinal\\nat Cortona, and for the other without the city, in a round window\\nthat is in the aforesaid Pieve, over the façade, on the right hand\\nas one enters the church, wherein are the arms of Pope Leo X, and\\nlikewise in two little windows that are in the Company of Gesù, in\\none of which is a Christ, and in the other a S. Onofrio. These are\\nno little different from his early works, and much better.\\nNow while Guglielmo, as has been related, was living in Cortona,\\nthere died at Arezzo one Fabiano di Stagio Sassoli, an Aretine, who\\nhad been a very good master of the making of large windows.\\nThereupon the Wardens of Works for the Vescovado gave the commission\\nfor three windows in the principal chapel, each twenty braccia in\\nheight, to Stagio, the son of the said Fabiano, and to the painter\\nDomenico Pecori; but when these were finished and fixed in their\\nplaces, they gave no great satisfaction to the Aretines, although\\nthey were passing good and rather worthy of praise than otherwise.\\nIt happened at this time that Messer Lodovico Belichini, an\\nexcellent physician, and one of the first men in the government of\\nthe city of Arezzo, went to Cortona to cure the mother of the\\naforesaid Cardinal; and there he became well acquainted with our\\nGuglielmo, with whom, when he had time, he was very willing to\\nconverse. And Guglielmo, who was then called the Prior, from his\\nhaving received about that time the benefice of a priory, likewise\\nconceived an affection for that physician, who asked him one day\\nwhether, with the good will of the Cardinal, he would go to Arezzo\\nto execute some windows; at which Guglielmo promised that he would,\\nand with the permission and good will of the Cardinal he made his\\nway to that city. Now Stagio, of whom we have spoken above, having\\nparted from the company of Domenico, received Guglielmo into his\\nhouse; and the latter, for his first work, executed for a window of\\nthe Chapel of S. Lucia, belonging to the Albergotti, in the\\nVescovado of Arezzo, that Saint and a S. Sylvester, in so good a\\nmanner that the work may truly be said to be made with living\\nfigures, and not of coloured and transparent glass, or at least to\\nbe a picture worthy of praise and marvellous. For besides the\\nmastery shown in the flesh-colours, the glasses are flashed; that\\nis, in some places the first skin has been removed, and the glass\\nthen coloured with another tint; by which is meant, for example, the\\nplacing of yellow over red flashed glass, or the application of\\nwhite and green over blue; which is a difficult and even miraculous\\nthing in this craft. The first or true colour, then, such as red,\\nblue, or green, covers the whole of one side; and the other part,\\nwhich is as thick as the blade of a knife, or a little more, is\\nwhite. Many, being afraid that they might break the glasses, on\\naccount of their lack of skill in handling them, do not employ a\\npointed iron for removing that layer, but in place of this, for\\ngreater safety, set about grinding the glasses with a copper wheel\\nfixed on the end of an iron instrument; and thus, little by little,\\nby the use of emery, they contrive to leave only a layer of white\\nglass, which turns out very clear. Then, if a yellow colour has to\\nbe applied to the piece of glass thus left white, at the moment when\\nit is to be placed into the furnace for firing, it is painted by\\nmeans of a brush with calcined silver, which is a colour similar to\\nbole, but somewhat thick; and in the fire this melts over the glass,\\nfuses, and takes a firm hold, penetrating into the glass and making\\na very beautiful yellow. These methods of working no one used\\nbetter, or with more ingenuity and art, than Prior Guglielmo; and it\\nis in these things that the difficulty consists, for painting the\\nglass with oil-colours or in any other manner is little or nothing,\\nand that it should be diaphanous or transparent is not a matter of\\nmuch importance, whereas firing it in the furnace and making it such\\nthat it will withstand the action of water and remain fresh for\\never, is a difficult work and well worthy of praise. Wherefore this\\nexcellent master deserves the highest praise, since there is not a\\nman of his profession who has done as much, whether in design, or\\ninvention, or colouring, or general excellence.\\nHe then made the great round-window of the same church, containing\\nthe Descent of the Holy Spirit, and likewise the Baptism of Christ\\nby S. John, wherein he represented Christ in the Jordan, awaiting S.\\nJohn, who has taken a cup of water in order to baptize Him, while a\\nnude old man is taking off his shoes, and some angels are preparing\\nChrist's raiment, and on high is the Father, sending down the Holy\\nSpirit upon His Son. This window is over the baptismal font of that\\nDuomo, for which he also executed the window containing the\\nResurrection of Lazarus on the fourth day after death; wherein it\\nseems impossible that he could have included in so small a space\\nsuch a number of figures, in which may be recognized the terror and\\namazement of the people, with the stench from the body of Lazarus,\\nwhose resurrection causes his two sisters to rejoice amid their\\ntears. In this work are innumerable colours, flashed one over the\\nother in the glass, and every least thing truly appears most natural\\nin its own kind.\\nAnd whoever wishes to learn how much the hand of the Prior was able\\nto effect in this art, should study the window of S. Matthew over\\nthe Chapel of that Apostle, and observe the marvellous invention of\\nthat scene, wherein he can see a living figure of Christ calling\\nMatthew from his tables, while Matthew, following Him and stretching\\nout his arms to receive Him, abandons the riches and treasures that\\nhe has acquired. And at the same time an Apostle may be seen in a\\nvery spirited attitude, awaking another who has fallen asleep on\\nsome steps; and in like manner there may also be perceived a S.\\nPeter speaking with S. John, both being so beautiful that they seem\\ntruly divine. In this same window are temples in perspective,\\nstaircases, and figures so well grouped, and landscapes so natural,\\nthat one would never think it was glass, but rather a thing rained\\ndown from Heaven for the consolation of mankind. In the same place\\nhe made the window of S. Anthony and that of S. Nicholas, both most\\nbeautiful, with two others, one containing the scene of Christ\\ndriving the traders from the Temple, and the other that of the woman\\ntaken in adultery; all these works being held to be truly excellent\\nand marvellous.\\nSo fully were the labours and abilities of the Prior recognized by\\nthe Aretines, what with praises, favours, and rewards, and so\\nsatisfied and contented was he by this result, that he resolved to\\nadopt that city as his home, and to change himself from a Frenchman\\ninto an Aretine. Afterwards, reflecting in his own mind that the art\\nof glass-painting, on account of the destruction that takes place\\nevery moment in such works, was no lasting one, there came to him a\\ndesire to devote himself to painting, and he therefore undertook to\\nexecute for the Wardens of Works of the Vescovado in that city three\\nvery large vaults in fresco, thinking thus to leave a memorial of\\nhimself behind him. The Aretines, in return for this, presented to\\nhim a farm that belonged to the Confraternity of S. Maria della\\nMisericordia, near their city, with some excellent houses, for his\\nenjoyment during his lifetime. And they ordained that when the work\\nwas finished, its value should be estimated by some distinguished\\ncraftsman, and that the Wardens should make this good to him in\\nfull. Whereupon he made up his mind to show his worth in this\\nundertaking, and he made his figures very large on account of the\\nheight, after the manner of the works in Michelagnolo's chapel. And\\nso mightily did his wish to become excellent in such an art avail in\\nhim, that although he was fifty years of age, he improved little by\\nlittle in such a manner, that he showed that his knowledge and\\ncomprehension of the beautiful were not less than his delight in\\nimitating the good in the execution of his work. He went on to\\nrepresent the earlier events of the New Testament, even as in the\\nthree large works he had depicted the beginning of the Old. For this\\nreason, therefore, I am inclined to believe that any man of genius\\nwho has the desire to attain to perfection, is able, if he will but\\ntake the pains, to make naught of the limits of any science. At the\\nbeginning of those works, indeed, he was alarmed by their size, and\\nbecause he had never executed any before; which was the reason that\\nhe sent to Rome for Maestro Giovanni, a French miniaturist, who,\\ncoming to Arezzo, painted over S. Antonio an arch with a Christ in\\nfresco, and for that Company the banner that is carried in\\nprocessions, which he executed with great diligence, having received\\nthe commission for them from the Prior.\\nAt the same time Guglielmo made the round window for the façade of\\nthe Church of S. Francesco, a great work, in which he represented\\nthe Pope in Consistory, with the Conclave of Cardinals, and S.\\nFrancis going to Rome for the confirmation of his Rule and bearing\\nthe roses of January. In this work he proved what a master of\\ncomposition he was, so that it may be said with truth that he was\\nborn for that profession; nor may any craftsman ever think to equal\\nhim in beauty, in abundance of figures, or in grace. There are\\ninnumerable windows executed by him throughout that city, all most\\nbeautiful, such as the great round window in the Madonna delle\\nLacrime, containing the Assumption of Our Lady and the Apostles, and\\na very beautiful window with an Annunciation; a round window with\\nthe Marriage of the Virgin, and another containing a S. Jerome\\nexecuted for the Spadari, and likewise three other windows below, in\\nvarious parts of the church; with a most beautiful round window with\\nthe Nativity of Christ in the Church of S. Girolamo, and another in\\nS. Rocco. He sent some, also, to various places, such as Castiglione\\ndel Lago, and one to Florence for Lodovico Capponi, to be set up in\\nS. Felicita, where there is the panel by Jacopo da Pontormo, a most\\nexcellent painter, and the chapel adorned by him with mural\\npaintings in oils and in fresco and with panel-pictures; which\\nwindow came into the hands of the Frati Ingesuati in Florence, who\\nworked at that craft, and they took it all to pieces in order to\\nlearn how it was made, removing many pieces as specimens and\\nreplacing them with new ones, so that in the end they made quite a\\ndifferent window.\\nHe also conceived the wish to paint in oils, and for the Chapel of\\nthe Conception in S. Francesco at Arezzo he executed a panel-picture\\nwherein are some vestments very well painted, and many heads most\\nlifelike, and so beautiful that he was honoured thereby ever\\nafterwards, seeing that this was the first work that he had ever\\ndone in oils.\\nThe Prior was a very honourable person, and delighted in agriculture\\nand in making alterations in buildings; wherefore, having bought a\\nmost beautiful house, he made in it a vast number of improvements.\\nAs a man of religion, he was always most upright in his ways; and\\nthe remorse of conscience, on account of his departure from his\\nconvent, kept him sorely afflicted. For which reason he made a very\\nbeautiful window for the Chapel of the High-altar in S. Domenico, a\\nconvent of his Order at Arezzo; wherein he depicted a vine that\\nissues from the body of S. Dominic and embraces a great number of\\nsanctified friars, who constitute the tree of the Order; and at the\\nhighest point is Our Lady, with Christ, who is marrying S. Catherine\\nof Siena--a work much extolled and of great mastery, for which he\\nwould accept no payment, believing himself to be much indebted to\\nthat Order. He sent a very beautiful window to S. Lorenzo in\\nPerugia, and an endless number of others to many places round\\nArezzo.\\nAnd because he took much pleasure in matters of architecture, he\\nmade for the citizens of that country a number of designs of\\nbuildings and adornments for their city, such as the two doors of S.\\nRocco in stone, and the ornament of grey-stone that was added to the\\npanel-picture of Maestro Luca in S. Girolamo; and he designed an\\nornament in the Abbey of Cipriano d' Anghiari, and another for the\\nCompany of the Trinità in the Chapel of the Crocifisso, and a very\\nrich lavatory for the sacristy; which were all executed with great\\nperfection by the stone-cutter Santi.\\nFinally, ever delighting in labour, and continually working both\\nwinter and summer at his mural painting, which breaks down the\\nhealthiest of men, he became so afflicted by the damp and so\\nswollen with dropsy, that his physicians had to tap him, and in a\\nfew days he rendered up his soul to Him who had given it. First,\\nlike a good Christian, he partook of the Sacraments of the Church,\\nand made his will. Then, having a particular devotion for the\\nHermits of Camaldoli, who have their seat on the summit of the\\nApennines, twenty miles distant from Arezzo, he bequeathed to them\\nhis property and his body, and to Pastorino da Siena, his assistant,\\nwho had been with him many years, he left his glasses, his\\nworking-instruments, and his designs, of which there is one in our\\nbook, a scene of the Submersion of Pharaoh in the Red Sea.\\nThis Pastorino afterwards applied himself to many other fields of\\nart, and also to glass windows, although the works that he produced\\nin that craft were but few. Guglielmo was much imitated, also, by\\none Maso Porro of Cortona, who was more able in firing and putting\\ntogether the glass than in painting it. One of the pupils of\\nGuglielmo was Battista Borro of Arezzo, who continues to imitate him\\ngreatly in the making of windows; and he also taught the first\\nrudiments to Benedetto Spadari and to Giorgio Vasari of Arezzo.\\nThe Prior lived sixty-two years, and died in the year 1537. He\\ndeserves infinite praise, in that by him there was brought into\\nTuscany the art of working in glass with the greatest mastery and\\ndelicacy that could be desired. Wherefore, since he conferred such\\ngreat benefits upon us, we also will pay him honour, exalting him\\ncontinually with loving and unceasing praise both for his life and\\nfor his works.\", 'SIMONE, CALLED IL CRONACA\\n[_SIMONE DEL POLLAIUOLO_]\\nARCHITECT OF FLORENCE\\nMany intellects are lost that would make rare and worthy works, if,\\non coming into the world, they were to hit upon persons able and\\nwilling to set them to work on those labours for which they are\\nfitted. But it often happens that he who has the means is neither\\ncapable nor willing; and if, indeed, there chances to be one willing\\nto erect some worthy building, he often takes no manner of care to\\nseek out an architect of real merit or of any loftiness of spirit.\\nNay, he puts his honour and glory into the keeping of certain\\nthievish creatures, who generally disgrace the name and fame of such\\nmemorials; and in order to thrust forward into greatness those who\\ndepend entirely upon him (so great is the power of ambition), he\\noften rejects the good designs that are offered to him, and puts\\ninto execution the very worst; wherefore his own fame is left\\nbesmirched by the clumsiness of the work, since it is considered by\\nall men of judgment that the craftsman and the patron who employs\\nhim, in that they are conjoined in their works, are of one and the\\nsame mind. And on the other hand, how many Princes of little\\nunderstanding have there been, who, through having chanced upon\\npersons of excellence and judgment, have obtained after death no\\nless fame from the memory of their buildings than they enjoyed when\\nalive from their sovereignty over their people.\\nTruly fortunate, however, in his day, was Cronaca, in that he not\\nonly had the knowledge, but also found those who kept him\\ncontinually employed, and that always on great and magnificent\\nworks. Of him it is related that while Antonio Pollaiuolo was in\\nRome, working at the tombs of bronze that are in S. Pietro, there\\ncame to his house a young lad, his relative, whose proper name was\\nSimone, and who had fled from Florence on account of some brawl.\\nThis Simone, having worked with a master in woodwork, and being much\\ninclined to the art of architecture, began to observe the beautiful\\nantiquities of that city, and, delighting in them, went about\\nmeasuring them with the greatest diligence. And, going on with this,\\nhe had not been long in Rome before he showed that he had made much\\nproficience, both in taking measurements and in carrying one or two\\nthings into execution.\\nThereupon he conceived the idea of returning to Florence, and\\ndeparted from Rome; and on arriving in his native city, having\\nbecome a passing good master of words, he described the marvels of\\nRome and of other places with such accuracy, that from that time\\nonwards he was called Il Cronaca, every man thinking that he was\\ntruly a chronicle of information in his discourse. Now he had become\\nsuch that he was held to be the most excellent of the modern\\narchitects in the city of Florence, seeing that he had good judgment\\nin choosing sites, and showed that he had an intellect more lofty\\nthan that of many others who were engaged in that profession; for it\\nwas evident from his works how good an imitator he was of\\nantiquities, and how closely he had observed the rules of Vitruvius\\nand the works of Filippo di Ser Brunellesco.\\nThere was then in Florence that Filippo Strozzi who is now called\\n\"the elder,\" to distinguish him from his son; and he, being very\\nrich, wished to leave to his native city and to his children, among\\nother memorials of himself, one in the form of a beautiful palace.\\nWherefore Benedetto da Maiano, having been called upon by him for\\nthis purpose, made him a model entirely isolated, which was\\nafterwards put into execution, although not in all its extent, as\\nwill be related below, for some of his neighbours would not give up\\ntheir houses to accommodate him. Benedetto began the palace,\\ntherefore, in the best way that he could, and brought the outer\\nshell almost to completion before the death of Filippo: which outer\\nshell is in the Rustic Order, with varying degrees of rustication,\\nas may be seen, since the boss-covered part from the first range of\\nwindows downwards, together with the doors, is very much Rustic, and\\nthe part from the first range of windows to the second is much less\\nRustic. Now it happened that at the very moment when Benedetto\\nwas leaving Florence, Cronaca returned from Rome; whereupon, Simone\\nbeing presented to Filippo, the latter was so pleased with the model\\nthat he made for the courtyard and for the great cornice which goes\\nround the outer side of the palace, that, having recognized the\\nexcellence of his intellect, he decided that thenceforward the whole\\nwork should pass through his hands, and availed himself of his\\nservices ever afterwards. Cronaca, then, in addition to the\\nbeautiful exterior in the Tuscan Order, made at the top a very\\nmagnificent Corinthian cornice, which serves to complete the roof;\\nand half of it is seen finished at the present day, with such\\nextraordinary grace that nothing could be added to it, nor could\\nanything more beautiful be desired. This cornice was taken by\\nCronaca, who copied it in Rome with exact measurements, from an\\nancient one that is to be found at Spoglia Cristo, which is held to\\nbe the most beautiful among the many that are in that city; although\\nit is true that it was enlarged by Cronaca to the proportions\\nrequired by the palace, to the end that it might make a suitable\\nfinish, and might also complete the roof of that palace by means of\\nits projection. Thus, then, the genius of Cronaca was able to make\\nuse of the works of others and to transform them almost into his\\nown; which does not succeed with many, since the difficulty lies not\\nin merely having drawings and copies of beautiful things, but in\\naccommodating them to the purpose which they have to serve, with\\ngrace, true measurement, proportion, and fitness. But just as much\\nas this cornice of Cronaca\\'s was and always will be extolled, so was\\nthat one censured which was made for the Palace of the Bartolini in\\nthe same city by Baccio d\\' Agnolo, who, seeking to imitate Cronaca,\\nplaced over a small façade, delicate in detail, a great ancient\\ncornice copied with the exact measurements from the frontispiece of\\nMonte Cavallo; which resulted in such ugliness, from his not having\\nknown how to adapt it with judgment, that it could not look worse,\\nfor it seems like an enormous cap on a small head. It is not enough\\nfor craftsmen, when they have executed their works, to excuse\\nthemselves, as many do, by saying that they were taken with exact\\nmeasurements from the antique and copied from good masters, seeing\\nthat good judgment and the eye play a greater part in all such\\nmatters than measuring with compasses. Cronaca, then, executed half\\nof the said cornice with great art right round that palace, together\\nwith dentils and ovoli, and finished it completely on two sides,\\ncounterpoising the stones in such a way, in order that they might\\nturn out well bound and balanced, that there is no better masonry to\\nbe seen, nor any carried to perfection with more diligence. In like\\nmanner, all the other stones are so well put together, and with so\\nhigh a finish, that the whole does not appear to be of masonry, but\\nrather all of one piece. And to the end that everything might be in\\nkeeping, he caused beautiful pieces of iron-work to be made for all\\nparts of the palace, as adornments for it, and the lanterns that are\\nat the corners, which were all executed with supreme diligence by\\nNiccolò Grosso, called Il Caparra, a smith of Florence. In those\\nmarvellous lanterns may be seen cornices, columns, capitals, and\\nbrackets of iron, fixed together with wonderful craftsmanship; nor\\nhas any modern ever executed in iron works so large and so\\ndifficult, and with such knowledge and mastery.\\nNiccolò Grosso was an eccentric and self-willed person, claiming\\njustice for himself and giving it to others, and never covetous of\\nwhat was not his own. He would never give anyone credit in the\\npayment of his works, and always insisted on having his\\nearnest-money. For this reason Lorenzo de\\' Medici called him Il\\nCaparra, and he was known to many others by that name. He had a\\nsign fixed over his shop, wherein were books burning; wherefore,\\nwhen one asked for time to make his payment, he would say, \"I cannot\\ngive it, for my books are burning, and I can enter no more debtors\\nin them.\" He was commissioned by the honourable Captains of the\\nGuelph party to make a pair of andirons, which, when he had finished\\nthem, were sent for several times. But he kept saying, \"On this\\nanvil do I sweat and labour, and on it will I have my money paid\\ndown.\" Whereupon they sent to him once more for the work, with a\\nmessage that he should come for his money, for he would straightway\\nbe paid; but he, still obstinate, answered that they must first\\nbring the money. The provveditore, therefore, knowing that the\\nCaptains wished to see the work, fell into a rage, and sent to him\\nsaying that he had received half the money, and that when he\\nhad dispatched the andirons, he would pay him the rest. On which\\naccount Caparra, recognizing that this was true, gave one of the\\nandirons to the messenger, saying: \"Take them this one, for it is\\ntheirs; and if it pleases them, bring me the rest of the money, and\\nI will hand over the other; but at present it is mine.\" The\\nofficials, seeing the marvellous work that he had put into it, sent\\nthe money to his shop; and he sent them the other andiron. It is\\nrelated, also, that Lorenzo de\\' Medici resolved to have some pieces\\nof iron-work made, to be sent abroad as presents, in order that the\\nexcellence of Caparra might be made known. He went, therefore, to\\nhis shop, and happened to find him working at some things for\\ncertain poor people, from whom he had received part of the price as\\nearnest-money. On Lorenzo making his request, Niccolò would in no\\nway promise to serve him before having satisfied the others, saying\\nthat they had come to his shop before Lorenzo, and that he valued\\ntheir money as much as his. To the same master some young men of the\\ncity brought a design, from which he was to make for them an iron\\ninstrument for breaking and forcing open other irons by means of a\\nscrew, but he absolutely refused to serve them; nay, he upbraided\\nthem, and said: \"Nothing will induce me to serve you in such a\\nmatter; for these things are nothing but thieves\\' tools, or\\ninstruments for abducting and dishonouring young girls. Such things\\nare not for me, I tell you, nor for you, who seem to me to be honest\\nmen.\" And they, perceiving that Caparra would not do their will,\\nasked him who there was in Florence who might serve them; whereupon,\\nflying into a rage, he drove them away with a torrent of abuse. He\\nwould never work for Jews, and was wont, indeed, to say that their\\nmoney was putrid and stinking. He was a good man and a religious,\\nbut whimsical in brain and obstinate: and he would never leave\\nFlorence, for all the offers that were made to him, but lived and\\ndied in that city. Of him I have thought it right to make this\\nrecord, because he was truly unique in his craft, and has never had\\nand never will have an equal, as may be seen best from the iron-work\\nand the beautiful lanterns of the Palace of the Strozzi.\\nThis palace was brought to completion by Cronaca, and adorned with\\na very rich courtyard in the Corinthian and Doric Orders, with\\nornaments in the form of columns, capitals, cornices, windows, and\\ndoors, all most beautiful. And if it should appear to anyone that\\nthe interior of this palace is not in keeping with the exterior, he\\nmust know that the fault is not Cronaca\\'s, for the reason that he\\nwas forced to adapt his interior to an outer shell begun by others,\\nand to follow in great measure what had been laid down by those\\nbefore him; and it was no small feat for him to have given it such\\nbeauty as it displays. The same answer may be made to any who say\\nthat the ascent of the stairs is not easy, nor correct in\\nproportion, but too steep and sudden; and likewise, also, to such as\\nsay that the rooms and apartments of the interior in general are out\\nof keeping, as has been described, with the grandeur and\\nmagnificence of the exterior. Nevertheless this palace will never be\\nheld as other than truly magnificent, and equal to any private\\nbuilding whatsoever that has been erected in Italy in our own times;\\nwherefore Cronaca rightly obtained, as he still does, infinite\\ncommendation for this work.\\nThe same master built the Sacristy of S. Spirito in Florence, which\\nis in the form of an octagonal temple, beautiful in proportions, and\\nexecuted with a high finish; and among other things to be seen in\\nthis work are some capitals fashioned by the happy hand of Andrea\\ndal Monte Sansovino, which are wrought with supreme perfection; and\\nsuch, likewise, is the antechamber of that sacristy, which is held\\nto be very beautiful in invention, although the coffered ceiling, as\\nwill be described, is not well distributed over the columns. The\\nsame Cronaca also erected the Church of S. Francesco dell\\'\\nOsservanza on the hill of S. Miniato, without Florence; and likewise\\nthe whole of the Convent of the Servite Friars, which is a highly\\nextolled work.\\nAt this same time there was about to be built, by the advice of Fra\\nGirolamo Savonarola, a most famous preacher of that day, the Great\\nCouncil Chamber of the Palace of the Signoria in Florence; and for\\nthis opinions were taken from Leonardo da Vinci, Michelagnolo\\nBuonarroti, although he was a mere lad, Giuliano da San Gallo,\\nBaccio d\\' Agnolo, and Simone del Pollaiuolo, called Il Cronaca, who\\nwas the devoted friend and follower of Savonarola. These men, after\\nmany disputes, came to an agreement, and decided that the Hall\\nshould be made in that form which it retained down to our own times,\\nwhen, as has been mentioned and will be related yet again in another\\nplace, it was almost rebuilt. The charge of the whole work was given\\nto Cronaca, as a man of talent and also as the friend of the\\naforesaid Fra Girolamo; and he executed it with great promptitude\\nand diligence, showing the beauty of his genius particularly in the\\nmaking of the roof, since the structure is of vast extent in every\\ndirection. He made the tie-beams of the roof-truss, which are\\nthirty-eight braccia in length from wall to wall, of a number of\\ntimbers well scarfed and fastened together, since it was not\\npossible to find beams of sufficient size for the purpose; and\\nwhereas the tie-beams of other roof-trusses have only one king-post,\\nall those of this Hall have three each, a king-post in the middle,\\nand a queen-post on either side. The rafters are long in proportion,\\nand so are the struts of each king-post and queen-post; nor must I\\nomit to say that the struts of the queen-posts, on the side nearest\\nthe wall, thrust against the rafters, and, towards the centre,\\nagainst the struts of the king-post. I have thought it right to\\ndescribe how this roof-truss is made, because it was constructed\\nwith beautiful design, and I have seen drawings made of it by many\\nfor sending to various places. When these tie-beams, thus contrived,\\nhad been drawn up and placed at intervals of six braccia, and the\\nroof had been likewise laid down in a very short space of time,\\nCronaca attended to the fixing of the ceiling, which was then made\\nof plain wood and divided into panels, each of which was four\\nbraccia square and surrounded by an ornamental cornice of few\\nmembers; and a flat moulding was made of the same width as the\\nplanks, which enclosed the panels and the whole work, with large\\nbosses at the intersections and the corners of the whole ceiling.\\nAnd although the end walls of this Hall, one on either side, were\\neight braccia out of the square, they did not make up their minds,\\nas they might have done, to thicken the walls so as to make it\\nsquare, but carried them up to the roof just as they were, making\\nthree large windows on each of those end walls. But when the whole\\nwas finished, the Hall, on account of its extraordinary size, turned\\nout to be too dark, and also stunted and wanting in height in\\nrelation to its great length and breadth; in short, almost wholly\\nout of proportion. They sought, therefore, but with little success,\\nto improve it by making two windows in the middle of the eastern\\nside of the Hall, and four on the western side. After this, in order\\nto give it its final completion, they made on the level of the brick\\nfloor, with great rapidity, being much pressed by the citizens, a\\nwooden tribune right round the walls of the Hall, three braccia both\\nin breadth and height, with seats after the manner of a theatre, and\\nwith a balustrade in front; on which tribune all the magistrates of\\nthe city were to sit. In the middle of the eastern side was a more\\nelevated daïs, on which the Signori sat with the Gonfalonier of\\nJustice; and on either side of this more prominent place was a door,\\none of them leading to the Segreto and the other to the\\nSpecchio. Opposite to this, on the west side, was an altar at\\nwhich Mass was read, with a panel by the hand of Fra Bartolommeo, as\\nhas been mentioned; and beside the altar was the pulpit for making\\nspeeches. In the middle of the Hall, then, were benches in rows laid\\ncrossways, for the citizens; while in the centre and at the corners\\nof the tribune were some gangways with six steps, providing a\\nconvenient ascent for the ushers in the collection of votes. In this\\nHall, which was much extolled at that day for its many beautiful\\nfeatures and the rapidity with which it was erected, time has since\\nserved to reveal such errors as that it is low, dark, gloomy, and\\nout of the square. Nevertheless Cronaca and the others deserve to be\\nexcused, both on account of the haste with which it was executed at\\nthe desire of the citizens, who intended in time to have it adorned\\nwith pictures and the ceiling overlaid with gold, and because up to\\nthat day there had been no greater hall built in Italy; although\\nthere are others very large, such as that of the Palace of S. Marco\\nin Rome, that of the Vatican, erected by Pius II and Innocent VIII,\\nthat of the Castle of Naples, that of the Palace of Milan, and those\\nof Urbino, Venice, and Padua.\\nAfter this, to provide an ascent to this Hall, Cronaca, with the\\nadvice of the same masters, made a great staircase six braccia wide\\nand curving in two flights, richly adorned with grey-stone, and with\\nCorinthian pilasters and capitals, double cornices, and arches, of\\nthe same stone; and with barrel-shaped vaulting, and windows with\\ncolumns of variegated marble and carved marble capitals. But\\nalthough this work was much extolled, it would have won even greater\\npraise if the staircase had not turned out inconvenient and too\\nsteep; for it is a sure fact that it could have been made more\\ngentle, as has been done in the time of Duke Cosimo, within the same\\namount of space and no more, in the new staircase made, opposite to\\nthat of Cronaca, by Giorgio Vasari, which is so gentle in ascent and\\nso convenient, that going up it is almost like walking on the level.\\nThis has been the work of the aforesaid Lord Duke Cosimo, who, being\\na man of most happy genius and most profound judgment both in the\\ngovernment of his people and in all other things, grudges neither\\nexpense nor anything else in his desire to make all the\\nfortifications and other buildings, both public and private,\\ncorrespond to the greatness of his own mind, and not less beautiful\\nthan useful or less useful than beautiful.\\nHis Excellency, then, reflecting that the body of this Hall is the\\nlargest, the most magnificent, and the most beautiful in all Europe,\\nhas resolved to have it improved in such parts as are defective, and\\nto have it made in every other part more ornate than any other\\nstructure in Italy, by the design and hand of Giorgio Vasari of\\nArezzo. And thus, the walls having been raised twelve braccia above\\ntheir former height, in such a manner that the height from the\\npavement to the ceiling is thirty-two braccia, the roof-truss made\\nby Cronaca to support the roof has been restored and replaced on\\nhigh after a new arrangement; and the old ceiling, which was simple\\nand commonplace, and by no means worthy of that Hall, has been\\nremodelled with a system of compartments of great variety, rich in\\nmouldings, full of carvings, and all overlaid with gold, together\\nwith thirty-nine painted panels, square, round, and octagonal, the\\ngreater number of which are each nine braccia in extent, and some\\neven more, and all containing scenes painted in oils, with the\\nlargest figures seven or eight braccia high. In these stories,\\ncommencing with the very beginning, may be seen the rise, the\\nhonours, the victories, and the glorious deeds of the city and\\nstate of Florence, and in particular the wars of Pisa and Siena,\\ntogether with an endless number of other things, which it would take\\ntoo long to describe. And on each of the side walls there has been\\nleft a convenient space of sixty braccia, in each of which are to be\\npainted three scenes in keeping with the ceiling and embracing the\\nspace of seven pictures on either side, which represent events from\\nthe wars of Pisa and Siena. These compartments on the walls are so\\nlarge, that no greater spaces for the painting of historical\\npictures have ever been seen either by the ancients or by the\\nmoderns. And the said compartments are adorned by some vast stone\\nornaments which meet at the ends of the Hall, at one side of which,\\nnamely, the northern side, the Lord Duke has caused to be finished a\\nwork begun and carried nearly to completion by Baccio Bandinelli,\\nthat is, a façade filled with columns and pilasters and with niches\\ncontaining statues of marble; which space is to serve as a public\\naudience chamber, as will be related in the proper place. On the\\nother side, opposite to this, there is to be, in a similar façade\\nthat is being made by the sculptor and architect Ammanati, a\\nfountain to throw up water in the Hall, with a rich and most\\nbeautiful adornment of columns and statues of marble and bronze. Nor\\nwill I forbear to say that this Hall, in consequence of the roof\\nhaving been raised twelve braccia, has gained not only height, but\\nalso an ample supply of windows, since, in addition to the others\\nthat are higher up, in each of those end walls are to be made three\\nlarge windows, which will be over the level of a corridor that is to\\nform a loggia within the Hall and to extend on one side over the\\nwork of Bandinelli, whence there will be revealed a most beautiful\\nview of the whole Piazza. But of this Hall, and of the other\\nimprovements that have been or are being made in the Palace, there\\nwill be a longer account in another place. This only let me say at\\npresent, that if Cronaca and those other ingenious craftsmen who\\ngave the design for the Hall could return to life, in my belief they\\nwould not recognize either the Palace, or the Hall, or any other\\nthing that is there. The Hall, namely, that part which is\\nrectangular, without counting the works of Bandinelli and Ammanati,\\nis ninety braccia in length and thirty-eight braccia in breadth.\\nBut returning to Cronaca: in the last years of his life there\\nentered into his head such a frenzy for the cause of Fra Girolamo\\nSavonarola, that he would talk of nothing else but that. Living\\nthus, in the end he died after a passing long illness, at the age of\\nfifty-five, and was buried honourably in the Church of S. Ambrogio\\nat Florence, in the year 1509; and after no long space of time the\\nfollowing epitaph was written for him by Messer Giovan Battista\\nStrozzi:\\n  CRONACA\\n  VIVO, E MILLE E MILLE ANNI E MILLE ANCORA,\\n  MERCÈ DE\\' VIVI MIEI PALAZZI E TEMPI,\\n  BELLA ROMA, VIVRÀ L\\' ALMA MIA FLORA.\\nCronaca had a brother called Matteo, who gave himself to sculpture\\nand worked under the sculptor Antonio Rossellino; but although he\\nwas a man of good and beautiful intelligence, a fine draughtsman,\\nand well practised in working marble, he left no finished work,\\nbecause, being snatched from the world by death at the age of\\nnineteen, he was not able to accomplish that which was expected from\\nhim by all who knew him.', \"DOMENICO PULIGO\\nPAINTER OF FLORENCE\\nIt is a marvellous and almost incredible thing, that many followers\\nof the art of painting, through continual practice and handling of\\ncolours, either by an instinct of nature or by the trick of a good\\nmanner, acquired without any draughtsmanship or grounding, carry\\ntheir works to such thorough completion, and very often contrive to\\nmake them so good, that, although the craftsmen themselves may be\\nnone of the rarest, their pictures force the world to extol them and\\nto hold them in supreme veneration. And it has been perceived in the\\npast from many examples, and in many of our painters, that the most\\nvivacious and perfect works are produced by those who have a\\nbeautiful manner from nature, although they must exercise it with\\ncontinual study and labour; while this gift of nature has such\\npower, that even if they neglect or abandon the studies of art, and\\npay attention to nothing save the mere practice of painting and of\\nhandling colours with a grace infused in them by nature, at the\\nfirst glance their works have the appearance of displaying all the\\nexcellent and marvellous qualities that are wont to appear after a\\nclose inspection in the works of those masters whom we hold to be\\nthe best. And that this is true, is demonstrated to us in our own\\nday by experience, from the works of Domenico Puligo, a painter of\\nFlorence; wherein what has been said above may be clearly recognized\\nby one who has knowledge of the matters of art.\\nWhile Ridolfo, the son of Domenico Ghirlandajo, was executing a\\nnumber of works in painting at Florence, as will be related, he\\nfollowed his father's habit of always keeping many young men\\npainting in his workshop: which was the reason that not a few of\\nthem, through competing one with another, became very good masters,\\nsome at making portraits from life, some at working in fresco,\\nothers in distemper, and others at painting readily on cloth. Making\\nthese lads execute pictures, panels, and canvases, in the course of\\na few years Ridolfo, with great profit for himself, sent an endless\\nnumber of these to England, to Germany, and to Spain. Baccio Gotti\\nand Toto del Nunziata, disciples of Ridolfo, were summoned, one to\\nFrance by King Francis, and the other to England by the King of that\\ncountry, each of whom invited them after having seen some of their\\nwork. Two other disciples of the same master remained with him,\\nworking under him for many years, because, although they had many\\ninvitations into Spain and Hungary from merchants and others, they\\nwere never induced either by promises or by money to tear themselves\\naway from the delights of their country, in which they had more work\\nto do than they were able to execute. One of these two was Antonio\\ndel Ceraiuolo, a Florentine, who, having been many years with\\nLorenzo di Credi, had learnt from him, above all, to draw so well\\nfrom nature, that with supreme facility he gave his portraits an\\nextraordinary likeness to the life, although otherwise he was no\\ngreat draughtsman. And I have seen some heads portrayed from life by\\nhis hand, which, although they have, for example, the nose crooked,\\none lip small and the other large, and other suchlike deformities,\\nnevertheless resemble the life, through his having well caught the\\nexpression of the subject; whereas, on the other hand, many\\nexcellent masters have made pictures and portraits of absolute\\nperfection with regard to art, but with no resemblance whatever to\\nthose that they are supposed to represent. And to tell the truth, he\\nwho executes portraits must contrive, without thinking of what is\\nlooked for in a perfect figure, to make them like those for whom\\nthey are intended. When portraits are like and also beautiful, then\\nmay they be called rare works, and their authors truly excellent\\ncraftsmen. This Antonio, then, besides many portraits, executed a\\nnumber of panel-pictures in Florence; but for the sake of brevity I\\nwill make mention only of two. One of these, wherein he painted a\\nCrucifixion, with S. Mary Magdalene and S. Francis, is in S. Jacopo\\ntra Fossi, on the Canto degli Alberti; and in the other, which is\\nin the Nunziata, is a S. Michael who is weighing souls.\\nThe other of the two aforesaid disciples was Domenico Puligo, who\\nwas more excellent in draughtsmanship and more pleasing and gracious\\nin colouring than any of the others mentioned above. He, considering\\nthat his method of painting with softness, without overloading his\\nworks with colour or making them hard, but causing the distances to\\nrecede little by little as though veiled with a kind of mist, gave\\nhis pictures both relief and grace, and that although the outlines\\nof the figures that he made were lost in such a way that his errors\\nwere concealed and hidden from view in the dark grounds into which\\nthe figures merged, nevertheless his colouring and the beautiful\\nexpressions of his heads made his works pleasing, always kept to the\\nsame method of working and to the same manner, which caused him to\\nbe held in esteem as long as he lived. But omitting to give an\\naccount of the pictures and portraits that he made while in the\\nworkshop of Ridolfo, some of which were sent abroad and some\\nremained in the city, I shall speak only of those which he painted\\nwhen he was rather the friend and rival of Ridolfo than his\\ndisciple, and of those that he executed when he was so much the\\nfriend of Andrea del Sarto, that nothing was more dear to him than\\nto see that master in his workshop, in order to learn from him,\\nshowing him his works and asking his opinion of them, so as to avoid\\nsuch errors and defects as those men often fall into who do not show\\ntheir work to any other craftsman, but trust so much in their own\\njudgment that they would rather incur the censure of all the world\\nwhen those works are finished, than correct them by means of the\\nsuggestions of loving friends.\\nOne of the first things that Domenico executed was a very beautiful\\npicture of Our Lady for Messer Agnolo della Stufa, who has it in his\\nAbbey of Capalona in the district of Arezzo, and holds it very dear\\nfor the great diligence of its execution and the beauty of its\\ncolouring. He painted another picture of Our Lady, no less beautiful\\nthan that one, for Messer Agnolo Niccolini, now Archbishop of Pisa\\nand a Cardinal, who keeps it in his house on the Canto de' Pazzi in\\nFlorence; and likewise another, of equal size and excellence, which\\nis now in the possession of Filippo dell' Antella, at Florence. In\\nanother, which is about three braccia in height, Domenico made a\\nfull-length Madonna with the Child between her knees, a little S.\\nJohn, and another head; and this picture, which is held to be one of\\nthe best works that he executed, since there is no sweeter colouring\\nto be seen, is at the present day in the possession of Messer\\nFilippo Spini, Treasurer to the most Illustrious Prince of Florence,\\nand a gentleman of magnificent spirit, who takes much delight in\\nworks of painting.\\nAmong other portraits that Domenico made from the life, which are\\nall beautiful and also good likenesses, the most beautiful is the\\none which he painted of Monsignore Messer Piero Carnesecchi, at that\\ntime a marvellously handsome youth, for whom he also made some other\\npictures, all very beautiful and executed with much diligence. In\\nlike manner, he portrayed in a picture the Florentine Barbara, a\\nfamous and most lovely courtesan of that day, much beloved by many\\nno less for her fine culture than for her beauty, and particularly\\nbecause she was an excellent musician and sang divinely. But the\\nbest work that Domenico ever executed was a large picture wherein he\\nmade a life-size Madonna, with some angels and little boys, and a S.\\nBernard who is writing; which picture is now in the hands of\\nGiovanni Gualberto del Giocondo, and of his brother Messer Niccolò,\\na Canon of S. Lorenzo in Florence.\\nThe same master made many other pictures, which are dispersed among\\nthe houses of citizens, and in particular some wherein may be seen a\\nhalf-length figure of Cleopatra, causing an asp to bite her on the\\nbreast, and others wherein is the Roman Lucretia killing herself\\nwith a dagger. There are also some very beautiful portraits from\\nlife and pictures by the same hand at the Porta a Pinti, in the\\nhouse of Giulio Scali, a man whose judgment is as fine in the\\nmatters of our arts as it is in those of every other most noble and\\nmost honourable profession. Domenico executed for Francesco del\\nGiocondo, in a panel for his chapel in the great tribune of the\\nChurch of the Servi at Florence, a S. Francis who is receiving the\\nStigmata; which work is very sweet and soft in colouring, and\\nwrought with much diligence. In the Church of Cestello, round the\\nTabernacle of the Sacrament, he painted two angels in fresco, and on\\nthe panel of a chapel in the same church he made a Madonna with her\\nSon in her arms, S. John the Baptist, S. Bernard, and other saints.\\nAnd since it appeared to the monks of that place that he had\\nacquitted himself very well in those works, they caused him to paint\\nin a cloister of their Abbey of Settimo, without Florence, the\\nVisions of Count Ugo, who built seven abbeys. And no long time\\nafter, Puligo painted, in a shrine at the corner of the Via Mozza da\\nS. Catarina, a Madonna standing, with her Son in her arms marrying\\nS. Catherine, and a figure of S. Peter Martyr. For a Company in the\\ntownship of Anghiari he executed a Deposition from the Cross, which\\nmay be numbered among his best works.\\nBut since it was his profession to attend rather to pictures of Our\\nLady, portraits, and other heads, than to great works, he gave up\\nalmost all his time to such things. Now if he had devoted himself\\nnot so much to the pleasures of the world, as he did, and more to\\nthe labours of art, there is no doubt that he would have made great\\nproficience in painting, and especially as Andrea del Sarto, who was\\nmuch his friend, assisted him on many occasions both with advice and\\nwith drawings; for which reason many of his works reveal a\\ndraughtsmanship as fine as the good and beautiful manner of the\\ncolouring. But the circumstance that Domenico was unwilling to\\nendure much fatigue, and accustomed to labour rather in order to get\\nthrough work and make money than for the sake of fame, prevented him\\nfrom reaching a greater height. And thus, associating with gay\\nspirits and lovers of good cheer, and with musicians and women, he\\ndied at the age of fifty-two, in the year 1527, in the pursuit of a\\nlove-affair, having caught the plague at the house of his mistress.\\nColour was handled by him in so good and harmonious a manner, that\\nit is for that reason, rather than for any other, that he deserves\\npraise. Among his disciples was Domenico Beceri of Florence, who,\\ngiving a high finish to his colouring, executed his works in an\\nexcellent manner.\"]\n"

       " ' OF FILIPPO LIPPI, CALLED FILIPPINO\\n\\nPAINTER OF FLORENCE\\n\\n\\nThere was at this same time in Florence a painter of most beautiful\\nintelligence and most lovely invention, namely, Filippo, son of Fra\\nFilippo of the Carmine, who, following in the steps of his dead\\nfather in the art of painting, was brought up and instructed, being\\nstill very young, by Sandro Botticelli, notwithstanding that his\\nfather had commended him on his death-bed to Fra Diamante, who was\\nmuch his friend--nay, almost his brother. Such was the intelligence\\nof Filippo, and so abundant his invention in painting, and so\\nbizarre and new were his ornaments, that he was the first who showed\\nto the moderns the new method of giving variety to vestments, and\\nembellished and adorned his figures with the girt-up garments of\\nantiquity. He was also the first to bring to light grotesques, in\\nimitation of the antique, and he executed them on friezes in\\nterretta or in colours, with more design and grace than the men\\nbefore him had shown; wherefore it was a marvellous thing to see the\\nstrange fancies that he expressed in painting. What is more, he\\nnever executed a single work in which he did not avail himself with\\ngreat diligence of Roman antiquities, such as vases, buskins,\\ntrophies, banners, helmet-crests, adornments of temples, ornamental\\nhead-dresses, strange kinds of draperies, armour, scimitars, swords,\\ntogas, mantles, and such a variety of other beautiful things, that\\nwe owe him a very great and perpetual obligation, seeing that he\\nadded beauty and adornment to art in this respect.\\n\\nIn his earliest youth he completed the Chapel of the Brancacci in\\nthe Carmine at Florence, begun by Masolino, and left not wholly\\nfinished by Masaccio on account of his death. Filippo, therefore,\\ngave it its final perfection with his own hand, and executed what\\nwas lacking in one scene, wherein S. Peter and S. Paul are restoring\\nto life the nephew of the Emperor. In the nude figure of this boy he\\nportrayed the painter Francesco Granacci, then a youth; and he also\\nmade portraits of the Chevalier, Messer Tommaso Soderini, Piero\\nGuicciardini, father of Messer Francesco the historian, Piero del\\nPugliese, and the poet Luigi Pulci; likewise Antonio Pollaiuolo, and\\nhimself as a youth, as he then was, which he never did again\\nthroughout the whole of his life, so that it has not been possible\\nto find a portrait of him at a more mature age. In the scene\\nfollowing this he portrayed Sandro Botticelli, his master, and many\\nother friends and people of importance; among others, the broker\\nRaggio, a man of great intelligence and wit, who executed in relief\\non a conch the whole Inferno of Dante, with all the circles and\\ndivisions of the pits and the nethermost well in their exact\\nproportions, and all the figures and details that were most\\ningeniously imagined and described by that great poet; which conch\\nwas held in those times to be a marvellous thing.\\n\\nNext, in the Chapel of Francesco del Pugliese at Campora, a seat of\\nthe Monks of the Badia, without Florence, he painted a panel in\\ndistemper of S. Bernard, to whom Our Lady is appearing with certain\\nangels, while he is writing in a wood; which picture is held to be\\nadmirable in certain respects, such as rocks, books, herbage, and\\nsimilar things, that he painted therein, besides the portrait from\\nlife of Francesco himself, so excellent that he seems to lack\\nnothing save speech. This panel was removed from that place on\\naccount of the siege, and placed for safety in the Sacristy of the\\nBadia of Florence. In S. Spirito in the same city, for Tanai de\\'\\nNerli, he painted a panel with Our Lady, S. Martin, S. Nicholas, and\\nS. Catherine; with a panel in the Chapel of the Rucellai in S.\\nPancrazio, and a Crucifix and two figures on a ground of gold in S.\\nRaffaello. In front of the Sacristy of S. Francesco, without the\\nPorta a S. Miniato, he made a God the Father, with a number of\\nchildren. At Palco, a seat of the Frati del Zoccolo, without Prato,\\nhe painted a panel; and in the Audience Chamber of the Priori in\\nthat territory he executed a little panel containing the Madonna, S.\\nStephen, and S. John the Baptist, which has been much extolled. On\\nthe Canto al Mercatale, also in Prato, in a shrine opposite to the\\nNuns of S. Margherita, and near some houses belonging to them, he\\npainted in fresco a very beautiful Madonna, with a choir of\\nseraphim, on a ground of dazzling light. In this work, among other\\nthings, he showed art and beautiful judgment in a dragon that is at\\nthe feet of S. Margaret, which is so strange and horrible, that it\\nis revealed to us as a true fount of venom, fire, and death; and the\\nwhole of the rest of the work is so fresh and vivacious in\\ncolouring, that it deserves infinite praise.\\n\\nHe also wrought certain things in Lucca, particularly a panel in a\\nchapel of the Church of S. Ponziano, which belongs to the Monks of\\nMonte Oliveto; in the centre of which chapel there is a niche\\ncontaining a very beautiful S. Anthony in relief by the hand of\\nAndrea Sansovino, a most excellent sculptor. Being invited to go to\\nHungary by King Matthias, Filippo refused, but made up for this by\\npainting two very beautiful panels for that King in Florence, and\\nsending them to him; and in one of these he made a portrait of the\\nKing, taken from his likeness on medals. He also sent certain works\\nto Genoa; and beside the Chapel of the High-Altar in S. Domenico at\\nBologna, on the left hand, he painted a S. Sebastian on a panel,\\nwhich was a thing worthy of much praise. For Tanai de\\' Nerli he\\nexecuted another panel in S. Salvadore, without Florence; and for\\nhis friend Piero del Pugliese he painted a scene with little\\nfigures, executed with so much art and diligence that when another\\ncitizen besought him to make a second like it, he refused, saying\\nthat it was not possible to do it.\\n\\nAfter these things he executed a very great work in Rome for the\\nNeapolitan Cardinal, Olivieri Caraffa, at the request of the elder\\nLorenzo de\\' Medici, who was a friend of that Cardinal. While going\\nthither for that purpose, he passed through Spoleto at the wish of\\nLorenzo, in order to give directions for the making of a marble tomb\\nfor his father Fra Filippo at the expense of Lorenzo, who had not\\nbeen able to obtain his body from the people of Spoleto for removal\\nto Florence. Filippo, therefore, made a beautiful design for the\\nsaid tomb, and Lorenzo had it erected after that design (as has\\nbeen told in another place), sumptuous and beautiful. Afterwards,\\nhaving arrived in Rome, Filippo painted a chapel in the Church of\\nthe Minerva for the said Cardinal Caraffa, depicting therein scenes\\nfrom the life of S. Thomas Aquinas, and certain most beautiful\\npoetical compositions ingeniously imagined by himself, for he had a\\nnature ever inclined to this. In the scene, then, wherein Faith has\\ntaken Infidelity captive, there are all the heretics and infidels.\\nHope has likewise overcome Despair, and so, too, there are many\\nother Virtues that have subjugated the Vice that is their opposite.\\nIn a disputation is S. Thomas defending the Church \"ex cathedra\"\\nagainst a school of heretics, and holding vanquished beneath him\\nSabellius, Arius, Averroes, and others, all clothed in graceful\\ngarments; of which scene we have in our book of drawings the\\noriginal design by Filippo\\'s own hand, with certain others by the\\nsame man, wrought with such mastery that they could not be bettered.\\nThere, too, is the scene when, as S. Thomas is praying, the Crucifix\\nsays to him, \"Bene scripsisti de me, Thoma\"; while a companion of\\nthe Saint, hearing that Crucifix thus speaking, is standing amazed\\nand almost beside himself. In the panel is the Virgin receiving the\\nAnnunciation from Gabriel; and on the main wall there is her\\nAssumption into Heaven, with the twelve Apostles round the\\nsepulchre. The whole of this work was held, as it still is, to be\\nvery excellent and wrought perfectly for a work in fresco. It\\ncontains a portrait from life of the said Cardinal Olivieri Caraffa,\\nBishop of Ostia, who was buried in this chapel in the year 1511, and\\nafterwards removed to the Piscopio in Naples.\\n\\n\\n\\nHaving returned to Florence, Filippo undertook to paint at his\\nleisure the Chapel of the elder Filippo Strozzi in S. Maria Novella,\\nand he actually began it; but, having finished the ceiling, he was\\ncompelled to return to Rome, where he wrought a tomb with\\nstucco-work for the said Cardinal, and decorated with gesso a little\\nchapel beside that tomb in a part of the same Church of the Minerva,\\ntogether with certain figures, some of which were executed by his\\ndisciple, Raffaellino del Garbo. The chapel described above was\\nvalued by Maestro Lanzilago of Padua and by the Roman Antonio, known\\nas Antoniasso, two of the best painters that were then in Rome,\\nat 2,000 ducats of gold, without the cost of the blues and of the\\nassistants. Having received this sum, Filippo returned to Florence,\\nwhere he finished the aforesaid Chapel of the Strozzi, which was\\nexecuted so well, and with so much art and design, that it causes\\nall who see it to marvel, by reason of the novelty and variety of\\nthe bizarre things that are seen therein--armed men, temples, vases,\\nhelmet-crests, armour, trophies, spears, banners, garments, buskins,\\nhead-dresses, sacerdotal vestments, and other things--all executed\\nin so beautiful a manner that they deserve the highest commendation.\\nIn this work there is the scene of Drusiana being restored to life\\nby S. John the Evangelist, wherein we see most admirably expressed\\nthe marvel of the bystanders at beholding a man restore life to a\\ndead woman by a mere sign of the cross; and the greatest amazement\\nof all is seen in a priest, or rather philosopher, whichever he may\\nbe, who is clothed in ancient fashion and has a vase in his hand. In\\nthe same scene, likewise, among a number of women draped in various\\nmanners, there is a little boy, who, terrified by a small spaniel\\nspotted with red, which has seized him with its teeth by one of his\\nswathing-bands, is running round his mother and hiding himself among\\nher clothes, and appears to be as much afraid of being bitten by the\\ndog as his mother is awestruck and filled with a certain horror at\\nthe resurrection of Drusiana. Next to this, in the scene where S.\\nJohn himself is being boiled in oil, we see the wrath of the judge,\\nwho is giving orders for the fire to be increased, and the flames\\nreflected on the face of the man who is blowing at them; and all the\\nfigures are painted in beautiful and varied attitudes. On the other\\nside is S. Philip in the Temple of Mars, compelling the serpent,\\nwhich has slain the son of the King with its stench, to come forth\\nfrom below the altar. In certain steps the painter depicted the hole\\nthrough which the serpent issued from beneath the altar, and so well\\ndid he paint the cleft in one of the steps, that one evening one of\\nFilippo\\'s lads, wishing to hide something, I know not what, from the\\nsight of someone who was knocking for admittance, ran up in haste in\\norder to conceal it in the hole, being wholly deceived by it.\\nFilippo also showed so much art in the serpent, that its venom,\\nfetid breath, and fire, appear rather real than painted. Greatly\\nextolled, too, is his invention in the scene of the Crucifixion of\\nthat Saint, for he imagined to himself, so it appears, that the\\nSaint was stretched on the cross while it lay on the ground, and\\nthat afterwards the whole was drawn up and raised on high by means\\nof ropes, cords, and poles; which ropes and cords are wound round\\ncertain fragments of antiquities, pieces of pillars, and bases, and\\npulled by certain ministers. On the other side the weight of the\\nsaid cross and of the Saint who is stretched nude thereon is\\nsupported by two men, on the one hand by a man with a ladder, with\\nwhich he is propping it up, and on the other hand by another with a\\npole, upholding it, while two others, setting a lever against the\\nbase and stem of the cross, are balancing its weight and seeking to\\nplace it in the hole made in the ground, wherein it had to stand\\nupright. But why say more? It would not be possible for the work to\\nbe better either in invention or in drawing, or in any other respect\\nwhatsoever of industry or art. Besides this, it contains many\\ngrotesques and other things wrought in chiaroscuro to resemble\\nmarble, executed in strange fashion with invention and most\\nbeautiful drawing.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the Frati Scopetini, also, at S. Donato, without Florence, which\\nis called Scopeto and is now in ruins, he painted a panel with the\\nMagi presenting their offerings to Christ, finished with great\\ndiligence, wherein he portrayed the elder Pier Francesco de\\' Medici,\\nson of Lorenzo di Bicci, in the figure of an astrologer who is\\nholding a quadrant in his hand, and likewise Giovanni, father of\\nSignor Giovanni de\\' Medici, and another Pier Francesco, brother of\\nthat Signor Giovanni, and other people of distinction. In this work\\nare Moors, Indians, costumes of strange shapes, and a most bizarre\\nhut. In a loggia at Poggio a Cajano he began a Sacrifice in fresco\\nfor Lorenzo de\\' Medici, but it remained unfinished. And for the\\nNunnery of S. Geronimo, above the Costa di S. Giorgio in Florence,\\nhe began the panel of the high-altar, which was brought nearly to\\ncompletion after his death by the Spaniard Alonzo Berughetta, but\\nafterwards wholly finished by other painters, Alonzo having gone to\\nSpain. In the Palazzo della Signoria he painted the panel of the\\nhall where the Council of Eight held their sittings, and he made the\\ndesign for another large panel, with its ornament, for the Sala\\ndel Consiglio; which design his death prevented him from beginning\\nto put into execution, although the ornament was carved; which\\nornament is now in the possession of Maestro Baccio Baldini, a most\\nexcellent physician of Florence, and a lover of every sort of\\ntalent. For the Church of the Badia of Florence he made a very\\nbeautiful S. Jerome; and he began a Deposition from the Cross for\\nthe high-altar of the Friars of the Nunziata, but only finished the\\nfigures in the upper half of the picture, for, being overcome by a\\nmost cruel fever and by that contraction of the throat that is\\ncommonly known as quinsy, he died in a few days at the age of\\nforty-five.\\n\\nThereupon, having ever been courteous, affable, and kindly, he was\\nlamented by all those who had known him, and particularly by the\\nyouth of his noble native city, who, in their public festivals,\\nmasques, and other spectacles, ever availed themselves, to their\\ngreat satisfaction, of the ingenuity and invention of Filippo, who\\nhas never had an equal in things of that kind. Nay, he was so\\nexcellent in all his actions, that he blotted out the stain (if\\nstain it was) left to him by his father--blotted it out, I say, not\\nonly by the excellence of his art, wherein he was inferior to no man\\nof his time, but also by the modesty and regularity of his life,\\nand, above all, by his courtesy and amiability; and how great are\\nthe force and power of such qualities to conciliate the minds of all\\nmen without exception, is only known to those who either have\\nexperienced or are experiencing it. Filippo was buried by his sons\\nin S. Michele Bisdomini, on April 13, 1505; and while he was being\\nborne to his tomb all the shops in the Via de\\' Servi were closed, as\\nis done sometimes for the obsequies of great men.\\n\\nAmong the disciples of Filippo, who all failed by a great measure to\\nequal him, was Raffaellino del Garbo, who made many works, as will\\nbe told in the proper place, although he did not justify the\\nopinions and hopes that were conceived of him while Filippo was\\nalive and Raffaellino himself still a young man. The fruits, indeed,\\nare not always equal to the blossoms that are seen in the spring.\\nNor did any great success come to Niccolò Zoccolo, otherwise known\\nas Niccolò Cartoni, who was likewise a disciple of Filippo, and\\npainted at Arezzo the wall that is over the altar of S. Giovanni\\nDecollato; a little panel, passing well done, in S. Agnesa; a panel\\nover a lavatory in the Abbey of S. Fiora, containing a Christ who is\\nasking for water from the woman of Samaria; and many other works,\\nwhich, since they were commonplace, are not mentioned.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBERNARDINO PINTURICCHIO\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " \" OF BERNARDINO PINTURICCHIO\\n\\nPAINTER OF PERUGIA\\n\\n\\nEven as many are assisted by fortune without being endowed with much\\ntalent, so, on the contrary, there is an infinite number of able men\\nwho are persecuted by an adverse and hostile fortune; whence it is\\nclearly manifest that she acknowledges as her children those who\\ndepend upon her without the aid of any talent, since it pleases her\\nto exalt by her favour certain men who would never be known through\\ntheir own merit; which is seen in Pinturicchio of Perugia, who,\\nalthough he made many works and was assisted by various helpers,\\nnevertheless had a much greater name than his works deserved.\\nHowever, he was a man who had much practice in large works, and ever\\nkept many assistants to aid him in his labours. Now, having worked\\nat many things in his early youth under his master Pietro da\\nPerugia, receiving a third of all that was earned, he was\\nsummoned to Siena by Cardinal Francesco Piccolomini to paint the\\nlibrary made by Pope Pius II in the Duomo of that city. It is true,\\nindeed, that the sketches and cartoons for all the scenes that he\\npainted there were by the hand of Raffaello da Urbino, then a youth,\\nwho had been his companion and fellow-disciple under the same\\nPietro, whose manner the said Raffaello had mastered very well. One\\nof these cartoons is still to be seen at the present day in Siena,\\nand some of the sketches, by the hand of Raffaello, are in our book.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow the stories in this work, wherein Pinturicchio was aided by many\\npupils and assistants, all of the school of Pietro, were divided\\ninto ten pictures. In the first is painted the scene when the said\\nPope Pius II was born to Silvio Piccolomini and Vittoria, and was\\ncalled Æneas, in the year 1405, in Valdorcia, at the township of\\nCorsignano, which is now called Pienza after the name of that Pope,\\nwho afterwards enriched it with buildings and made it a city; and in\\nthis picture are portraits from nature of the said Silvio and\\nVittoria. In the same is the scene when, in company with Cardinal\\nDomenico of Capranica, he is crossing the Alps, which are covered\\nwith ice and snow, on his way to the Council of Bâle. In the second\\nthe Council is sending Æneas on many embassies--namely, to Argentina\\n(three times), to Trent, to Constance, to Frankfurt, and to Savoy.\\nIn the third is the sending of the same Æneas by the Antipope Felix\\nas ambassador to the Emperor Frederick III, with whom the ready\\nintelligence, the eloquence, and the grace of Æneas found so much\\nfavour that he was given the poet's crown of laurel by Frederick\\nhimself, who made him his Protonotary, received him into the number\\nof his friends, and appointed him his First Secretary. In the fourth\\nhe is sent by Frederick to Eugenius IV, by whom he was made Bishop\\nof Trieste, and then Archbishop of Siena, his native city. In the\\nfifth scene the same Emperor, who is about to come to Italy to\\nreceive the crown of Empire, is sending Æneas to Telamone, a port of\\nthe people of Siena, to meet his wife, Leonora, who was coming from\\nPortugal. In the sixth Æneas is going to Calistus IV, at the\\nbidding of the said Emperor, to induce him to make war against the\\nTurks; and in this part, Siena being harassed by the Count of\\nPittigliano and by others at the instigation of King Alfonso of\\nNaples, that Pontiff is sending him to treat for peace. This\\neffected, war is planned against the Orientals; and he, having\\nreturned to Rome, is made a Cardinal by the said Pontiff. In the\\nseventh, Calistus being dead, Æneas is seen being created Supreme\\nPontiff, and called Pius II. In the eighth the Pope goes to Mantua\\nfor the Council about the expedition against the Turks, where the\\nMarquis Lodovico receives him with most splendid pomp and incredible\\nmagnificence. In the ninth the same Pope is placing in the catalogue\\nof saints--or, as the saying is, canonizing--Catherine of Siena, a\\nholy woman and nun of the Preaching Order. In the tenth and last,\\nwhile preparing a vast expedition against the Turks with the help\\nand favour of all the Christian Princes, Pope Pius dies at\\nAncona; and a hermit of the Hermitage of Camaldoli, a holy man, sees\\nthe soul of the said Pontiff being borne by Angels into Heaven at\\nthe very moment of his death, as may also be read. Afterwards, in\\nthe same picture, the body of the same Pope is seen being borne from\\nAncona to Rome by a vast and honourable company of lords and\\nprelates, who are lamenting the death of so great a man and so rare\\nand holy a Pontiff. The whole of this work is full of portraits from\\nthe life, so numerous that it would be a long story to recount their\\nnames; and it is all painted with the finest and most lively\\ncolours, and wrought with various ornaments of gold, and with very\\nwell designed partitions in the ceiling. Below each scene is a Latin\\ninscription, which describes what is contained therein. In the\\ncentre of this library the said Cardinal Francesco Piccolomini,\\nnephew of the Pope, placed the three Graces of marble, ancient and\\nmost beautiful, which are still there, and which were the first\\nantiquities to be held in price in those times. This library,\\nwherein are all the books left by the said Pius II, was scarcely\\nfinished, when the same Cardinal Francesco, nephew of the aforesaid\\nPontiff, Pius II, was created Pope, choosing the name of Pius III in\\nmemory of his uncle. Over the door of that library, which opens into\\nthe Duomo, the same Pinturicchio painted in a very large scene,\\noccupying the whole extent of the wall, the Coronation of the said\\nPope Pius III, with many portraits from life; and beneath it may be\\nread these words:\\n\\n     PIUS III SENENSIS, PII SECUNDI NEPOS, MDIII, SEPTEMBRIS XXI,\\n     APERTIS ELECTUS SUFFRAGIIS, OCTAVO OCTOBRIS CORONATUS EST.\\n\\nWhen Pinturicchio was working with Pietro Perugino and painting at\\nRome in the time of Pope Sixtus, he had also been in the service of\\nDomenico della Rovere, Cardinal of San Clemente; wherefore the said\\nCardinal, having built a very beautiful palace in the Borgo Vecchio,\\ncharged Pinturicchio to paint the whole of it, and to make on the\\nfaçade the coat of arms of Pope Sixtus, with two little boys as\\nsupporters. The same master executed certain works for Sciarra Colonna\\nin the Palace of S. Apostolo; and no long time after--namely, in the\\nyear 1484--Innocent VIII, the Genoese, caused him to paint certain\\nhalls and loggie in the Palace of the Belvedere, where, among other\\nthings, by order of that Pope, he painted a loggia full of landscapes,\\ndepicting therein Rome, Milan, Genoa, Florence, Venice, and Naples,\\nafter the manner of the Flemings; and this, being a thing not\\ncustomary at that time, gave no little satisfaction. In the same\\nplace, over the principal door of entrance, he painted a Madonna in\\nfresco. In S. Pietro, in the chapel that contains the Lance which\\npierced the side of Christ, he painted a panel in distemper, with the\\nMadonna larger than life, for the said Innocent VIII; and he painted\\ntwo chapels in the Church of S. Maria del Popolo, one for the\\naforesaid Domenico della Rovere, Cardinal of San Clemente, who was\\nafterwards buried therein, and the other for Cardinal Innocenzio Cibo,\\nwherein he also was afterwards buried; and in each of these chapels he\\nportrayed the Cardinal who had caused him to paint it. In the Palace\\nof the Pope he painted certain rooms that look out upon the courtyard\\nof S. Pietro, the ceilings and paintings of which were renovated a few\\nyears ago by Pope Pius IV. In the same palace Alexander VI caused\\nPinturicchio to paint all the rooms that he occupied, together with\\nthe whole of the Borgia Tower, wherein he wrought stories of the\\nliberal arts in one room, besides decorating all the ceilings with\\nstucco and gold; but, since they did not then know the method of\\nstucco-work that is now in use, the aforesaid ornaments are for the\\nmost part ruined. Over the door of an apartment in the said palace he\\nportrayed the Signora Giulia Farnese in the countenance of a Madonna,\\nand, in the same picture, the head of Pope Alexander in a figure that\\nis adoring her.\\n\\nBernardino was much given to making gilt ornaments in relief for his\\npictures, to satisfy people who had little understanding of his art\\nwith the more showy lustre that this gave them, which is a most\\nbarbarous thing in painting. Having then executed a story of S.\\nCatherine in the said apartments, he depicted the arches of Rome in\\nrelief and the figures in painting, insomuch that, the figures being\\nin the foreground and the buildings in the background, the things\\nthat should recede stand out more prominently than those that should\\nstrike the eye as the larger--a very grave heresy in our art.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the Castello di S. Angelo he painted a vast number of rooms with\\ngrotesques; and in the Great Tower, in the garden below, he painted\\nstories of Pope Alexander, with portraits of the Catholic Queen,\\nIsabella; Niccolò Orsino, Count of Pittigliano; Gianjacomo Trivulzi,\\nand many other relatives and friends of the said Pope, in particular\\nCæsar Borgia and his brother and sisters, with many talented men of\\nthose times. At Monte Oliveto in Naples, in the Chapel of Paolo\\nTolosa, there is a panel with an Assumption by the hand of\\nPinturicchio. This master made an infinite number of other works\\nthroughout all Italy, which, since they are of no great excellence,\\nand wrought in a superficial manner, I will pass over in silence.\\nPinturicchio used to say that a painter could only give the greatest\\nrelief to his figures when he had it in himself, without owing\\nanything to principles or to others. He also made works in Perugia,\\nbut these were few. In the Araceli he painted the Chapel of S.\\nBernardino; and in S. Maria del Popolo, where, as we have said, he\\npainted the two chapels, he made the four Doctors of the Church on\\nthe vaulting of the principal chapel.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfterwards, having reached the age of fifty-nine, he was\\ncommissioned to paint the Nativity of Our Lady on a panel in S.\\nFrancesco at Siena. To this he set his hand, and the friars assigned\\nto him a room to live in, which they gave to him, as he wished,\\nempty and stripped of everything, save only a huge old chest, which\\nappeared to them too awkward to remove. But Pinturicchio, like the\\nstrange and whimsical man that he was, made such an outcry at this,\\nand repeated it so often, that finally in despair the friars set\\nthemselves to carry it away. Now their good fortune was such, that\\nin removing it there was broken a plank which contained 500 Roman\\nducats of gold; at which Pinturicchio was so displeased, and felt so\\naggrieved at the good luck of those poor friars, that it can hardly\\nbe imagined--nay, he took it so much to heart, being unable to get\\nit out of his thoughts, that it was the death of him. His pictures\\ndate about the year 1513.\\n\\nA companion and friend of Pinturicchio, although he was a much older\\nman, was Benedetto Buonfiglio, a painter of Perugia, who executed\\nmany works in company with other masters in the Papal Palace at\\nRome. In the Chapel of the Signoria in Perugia, his native city, he\\npainted scenes from the life of S. Ercolano, Bishop and Protector of\\nthat city, and in the same place certain miracles wrought by S.\\nLouis. In S. Domenico he painted the story of the Magi on a panel in\\ndistemper, and many saints on another. In the Church of S.\\nBernardino he painted a Christ in the sky, with S. Bernardino\\nhimself, and a multitude below. In short, this master was in no\\nlittle repute in his native city before Pietro Perugino had come to\\nbe known.\\n\\nAnother friend of Pinturicchio, associated with him in not a few of\\nhis works, was Gerino Pistoiese, who was held to be a diligent\\ncolourist and a faithful imitator of the manner of Pietro Perugino,\\nwith whom he worked nearly up to his death. He did little work in\\nhis native city of Pistoia; but for the Company of the Buon Gesù in\\nBorgo San Sepolcro he painted a Circumcision in oil on a panel,\\nwhich is passing good. In the Pieve of the same place he painted a\\nchapel in fresco; and on the bank of the Tiber, on the road that\\nleads to Anghiari, he painted another chapel, also in fresco, for\\nthe Commune. And he painted still another chapel in the same place,\\nin S. Lorenzo, an abbey of the Monks of Camaldoli. By reason of all\\nthese works he made so long a stay in the Borgo that he almost\\nadopted it as his home. He was a sorry fellow in matters of art,\\nlabouring with the greatest difficulty, and toiling with such pains\\nat the execution of a work, that it was a torture to him.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt this same time there was a painter in the city of Foligno,\\nNiccolò Alunno, who was held to be excellent, for it was little the\\ncustom before Pietro Perugino's day to paint in oil, and many were\\nheld to be able men who did not afterwards justify this opinion.\\nNiccolò therefore gave no little satisfaction with his works, since,\\nalthough he only painted in distemper, he portrayed the heads of his\\nfigures from life, so that they appeared alive, and his manner won\\nconsiderable praise. In S. Agostino at Foligno there is a panel by\\nhis hand with a Nativity of Christ, and a predella with little\\nfigures. At Assisi he painted a banner that is borne in processions,\\nbesides the panel of the high-altar in the Duomo, and another panel\\nin S. Francesco. But the best painting that Niccolò ever did was in\\na chapel in the Duomo, where, among other things, there is a\\nPietà, with two angels who are holding two torches and weeping so\\nnaturally, that I do not believe that any other painter, however\\nexcellent, would have been able to do much better. In the same place\\nhe also painted the façade of S. Maria degli Angeli, besides many\\nother works of which there is no need to make mention, it being\\nenough to have touched on the best. And let this be the end of the\\nLife of Pinturicchio, who, besides his other qualities, gave no\\nlittle satisfaction to many princes and lords because he finished\\nand delivered his works quickly, which is their pleasure, although\\nsuch works are perchance less excellent than those that are made\\nslowly and deliberately.\\n\\n\\nFRANCESCO FRANCIA\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \" OF FRANCESCO FRANCIA\\n\\nGOLDSMITH AND PAINTER OF BOLOGNA\\n\\n\\nFrancesco Francia, who was born in Bologna in the year 1450, of\\nparents who were artisans, but honest and worthy enough, was\\napprenticed in his earliest boyhood to the goldsmith's art, in which\\ncalling he worked with intelligence and spirit; and as he grew up he\\nbecame so well proportioned in person and appearance, and so sweet and\\npleasant in manner and speech, that he was able to keep the most\\nmelancholy of men cheerful and free from care with his talk; for which\\nreason he was beloved not only by all those who knew him, but also by\\nmany Italian princes and other lords. While working as a goldsmith,\\nthen, he gave attention to design, in which he took so much pleasure,\\nthat his mind began to aspire to higher things, and he made very great\\nprogress therein, as may be seen from many works in silver that he\\nexecuted in his native city of Bologna, and particularly from certain\\nmost excellent works in niello. In this manner of work he often put\\ntwenty most beautiful and well-proportioned little figures within a\\nspace no higher than the breadth of two fingers and not much more in\\nlength. He also enamelled many works in silver, which were destroyed\\nat the time of the ruin and exile of the Bentivogli. In a word, he did\\neverything that can be done in that art better than any other man.\\n\\nBut that in which he delighted above all, and in which he was truly\\nexcellent, was the making of dies for medals, wherein he was the\\nrarest master of his day, as may be seen in some that he made with a\\nmost lifelike head of Pope Julius II, which bear comparison with\\nthose of Caradosso; not to mention that he made medals of Signor\\nGiovanni Bentivogli, in which he appears alive, and of an infinite\\nnumber of princes, who would stop in Bologna on their way through\\nthe city, whereupon he would make their portraits in wax for medals,\\nand afterwards, having finished the matrices of the dies, he would\\nsend them; for which, besides immortal fame, he also received very\\nrich presents. As long as he lived he was ever Master of the Mint in\\nBologna, for which he made the stamps of all the dies, both under\\nthe rule of the Bentivogli and also during the lifetime of Pope\\nJulius, after their departure, as is proved by the coins struck by\\nthat Pope on his entrance into the city, which had on one side his\\nhead portrayed from life, and on the other these words: BONONIA PER\\nJULIUM A TYRANNO LIBERATA. So excellent was he held in this\\nprofession, that he continued to make the dies for the coinage down\\nto the time of Pope Leo; and the impressions of his dies are so\\ngreatly prized, and those who have some hold them in such esteem,\\nthat money cannot buy them.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow it came to pass that Francia, being desirous of greater glory,\\nand having known Andrea Mantegna and many other painters who had\\ngained wealth and honours by their art, determined to try whether he\\ncould succeed in that part of painting which had to do with colour;\\nhis drawing was already such that it could well bear comparison with\\ntheirs. Thereupon, having made arrangements to try his hand, he\\npainted certain portraits and some little things, keeping in his\\nhouse for many months men of that profession to teach him the means\\nand methods of colouring, insomuch that, having very good judgment,\\nhe soon acquired the needful practice. The first work that he made\\nwas a panel of no great size for Messer Bartolommeo Felicini, who\\nplaced it in the Misericordia, a church without Bologna; in which\\npanel there is a Madonna seated on a throne, with many other\\nfigures, and the said Messer Bartolommeo portrayed from life. This\\nwork, which was wrought in oil with the greatest diligence, was\\npainted by him in the year 1490; and it gave such satisfaction in\\nBologna, that Messer Giovanni Bentivogli, desiring to honour his own\\nchapel, which was in S. Jacopo in that city, with works by this new\\npainter, commissioned him to paint a panel with the Madonna in the\\nsky, two figures on either side of her, and two angels below\\nsounding instruments; which work was so well executed by Francia,\\nthat he won from Messer Giovanni, besides praise, a most honourable\\npresent. Wherefore Monsignore de' Bentivogli, impressed by this\\nwork, caused him to paint a panel containing the Nativity of Christ,\\nwhich was much extolled, for the high-altar of the Misericordia;\\nwherein, besides the design, which is not otherwise than beautiful,\\nthe invention and the colouring are worthy of nothing but praise. In\\nthis work he made a portrait of Monsignore de' Bentivogli from the\\nlife (a very good likeness, so it is said by those who knew him),\\nclothed in that very pilgrim's dress in which he returned from\\nJerusalem. He also painted a panel in the Church of the Nunziata,\\nwithout the Porta di S. Mammolo, representing the Madonna receiving\\nthe Annunciation from the Angel, with two figures on either side,\\nwhich is held to be a very well executed work.\\n\\nNow that Francia's works had spread his fame abroad, even as his\\npainting in oil had brought him both profit and repute, so he\\ndetermined to try whether he would succeed as well at working in\\nfresco. Messer Giovanni Bentivogli had caused his palace to be\\npainted by diverse masters of Ferrara and Bologna, and by certain\\nothers from Modena; but, having seen Francia's experiments in\\nfresco, he determined that this master should paint a scene on one\\nwall of an apartment that he occupied for his own use. There Francia\\npainted the camp of Holofernes, guarded by various sentinels both on\\nfoot and on horseback, who were keeping watch over the pavilions;\\nand the while that they were intent on something else, the sleeping\\nHolofernes was seen surprised by a woman clothed in widow's\\ngarments, who, with her left hand, was holding his hair, which was\\nwet with the heat of wine and sleep, and with her right hand she was\\nstriking the blow to slay her enemy, the while that an old wrinkled\\nhandmaid, with the true air of a most faithful slave, and with her\\neyes fixed on those of her Judith in order to encourage her, was\\nbending down and holding a basket near the ground, to receive\\ntherein the head of the slumbering lover. This scene was one of the\\nmost beautiful and most masterly that Francia ever painted, but it\\nwas thrown to the ground in the destruction of that edifice at the\\ntime of the expulsion of the Bentivogli, together with another scene\\nover that same apartment, coloured to look like bronze, and\\nrepresenting a disputation of philosophers, which was excellently\\nwrought, with his conception very well expressed. These works\\nbrought it about that he was loved and honoured by Messer Giovanni\\nand all the members of his house, and, after them, by all the city.\\n\\nIn the Chapel of S. Cecilia, which is attached to the Church of S.\\nJacopo, he painted two scenes wrought in fresco, in one of which he\\nmade the Marriage of Our Lady with Joseph, and in the other the\\nDeath of S. Cecilia--a work held in great esteem by the people of\\nBologna. And, indeed, Francia gained such mastery and such\\nconfidence from seeing his works advancing towards the perfection\\nthat he desired, that he executed many pictures, of which I will\\nmake no mention, it being enough for me to point out, to all who may\\nwish to see his works, only the best and most notable. Nor did his\\npainting hinder him from carrying on both the Mint and his other\\nwork of making medals, as he had done from the beginning. Francia,\\nso it is said, felt the greatest sorrow at the departure of Messer\\nGiovanni Bentivogli, for he had received such great benefits from\\nMesser Giovanni, that it caused him infinite grief; however, like\\nthe prudent and orderly man that he was, he kept at his work. After\\nhis parting from his patron, he painted three panels that went to\\nModena, in one of which there was the Baptism of Christ by S. John;\\nin the second, a very beautiful Annunciation; and in the last, which\\nwas placed in the Church of the Frati dell' Osservanza, a Madonna in\\nthe sky with many figures.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fame of so excellent a master being spread abroad by means of so\\nmany works, the cities contended with one another to obtain his\\npictures. Whereupon he painted a panel for the Black Friars of S.\\nGiovanni in Parma, containing a Dead Christ in the lap of Our Lady,\\nsurrounded by many figures; which panel was universally held to be a\\nmost beautiful work; and the same friars, therefore, thinking that\\nthey had been well served, induced him to make another for a house\\nof theirs at Reggio in Lombardy, wherein he painted a Madonna with\\nmany figures. At Cesena, likewise for the church of these friars, he\\nexecuted another panel, painting therein the Circumcision of Christ,\\nwith lovely colouring. Nor would the people of Ferrara consent to\\nbe left behind by their neighbours; nay, having determined to adorn\\ntheir Duomo with works by Francia, they commissioned him to paint a\\npanel, on which he made a great number of figures; and they named it\\nthe panel of Ognissanti. He painted one in S. Lorenzo at Bologna,\\nwith a Madonna, a figure on either side, and two children below,\\nwhich was much extolled; and scarcely had he finished this when he\\nhad to make another in S. Giobbe, representing a Crucifixion, with\\nthat Saint kneeling at the foot of the Cross, and two figures at the\\nsides.\\n\\nSo widely had the fame and the works of this craftsman spread\\nthroughout Lombardy, that even from Tuscany men sent for something\\nby his hand, as they did from Lucca, whither there went a panel\\ncontaining a S. Anne and a Madonna, with many other figures, and a\\nDead Christ above in the lap of His Mother; which work is set up in\\nthe Church of S. Fridiano, and is held in great price by the people\\nof Lucca. For the Church of the Nunziata in Bologna he painted two\\nother panels, which were wrought with much diligence; and in the\\nMisericordia, likewise, without the Porta a Strà Castione, at the\\nrequest of a lady of the Manzuoli family, he painted another,\\nwherein he depicted the Madonna with the Child in her arms, S.\\nGeorge, S. John the Baptist, S. Stephen, and S. Augustine, with an\\nangel below, who has his hands clasped with such grace, that he\\nappears truly to belong to Paradise. He executed another for the\\nCompany of S. Francesco in the same city, and likewise one for the\\nCompany of S. Gieronimo. He lived in close intimacy with Messer Polo\\nZambeccaro, who, being much his friend, and wishing to have some\\nmemorial of him, caused him to paint a rather large picture of the\\nNativity of Christ, which is one of the most celebrated works that\\nhe ever made; and for this reason Messer Polo commissioned him to\\npaint at his villa two figures in fresco, which are very beautiful.\\nHe also executed a most charming scene in fresco in the house of\\nMesser Gieronimo Bolognino, with many varied and very beautiful\\nfigures.\\n\\nAll these works together had won him such veneration in that city,\\nthat he was held in the light of a god; and what made this\\ninfinitely greater was that the Duke of Urbino caused him to paint a\\nset of horse's caparisons, in which he made a vast forest of trees\\nthat had caught fire, from which there were issuing great numbers of\\nall sorts of animals, both of the air and of the earth, and certain\\nfigures--a terrible, awful, and truly beautiful thing, which was\\nheld in no little esteem by reason of the time spent in painting the\\nplumage of the birds, and the various sorts of terrestrial animals,\\nto say nothing of the diversity of foliage and the variety of\\nbranches that were seen in the different trees. For this work\\nFrancia was rewarded with gifts of great value as a recompense for\\nhis labours, not to mention that the Duke ever held himself indebted\\nto him for the praises that he received for it. Duke Guido Baldo,\\nalso, has in his guardaroba a picture of the Roman Lucretia, which\\nhe esteems very highly, by the same man's hand, together with many\\nother pictures, of which mention will be made when the time comes.\\n\\nAfter these things he painted a panel for the altar of the Madonna\\nin SS. Vitale e Agricola; in which panel are two very beautiful\\nangels, who are playing on the lute. I will not enumerate the\\npictures that are scattered throughout Bologna in the houses of\\ngentlemen of that city, and still less the infinite number of\\nportraits that he made from life, for it would be too wearisome. Let\\nit be enough to say that while he was living in such glory and\\nenjoying the fruits of his labours in peace, Raffaello da Urbino was\\nin Rome, and all day long there flocked round him many strangers,\\namong them many gentlemen of Bologna, eager to see his works. And\\nsince it generally comes to pass that every man extols most\\nwillingly the intellects of his native place, these Bolognese began\\nto praise the works, the life, and the talents of Francia in the\\npresence of Raffaello, and they established such a friendship\\nbetween them with these words, that Francia and Raffaello sent\\nletters of greeting to each other. And Francia, hearing such great\\npraise spoken of the divine pictures of Raffaello, desired to see\\nhis works; but he was now old, and too fond of his comfortable life\\nin Bologna. Now after this it came about that Raffaello painted in\\nRome for Cardinal Santi Quattro, of the Pucci family, a\\npanel-picture of S. Cecilia, which had to be sent to Bologna to be\\nplaced in a chapel of S. Giovanni in Monte, where there is the tomb\\nof the Blessed Elena dall' Olio. This he packed up and addressed to\\nFrancia, who, as his friend, was to have it placed on the altar of\\nthat chapel, with the ornament, just as he had prepared it himself.\\nRight readily did Francia accept this charge, which gave him a\\nchance of seeing a work by Raffaello, as he had so much desired. And\\nhaving opened the letter that Raffaello had written to him, in which\\nhe besought Francia, if there were any scratch in the work, to put\\nit right, and likewise, as a friend, to correct any error that he\\nmight notice, with the greatest joy he had the said panel taken from\\nits case into a good light. But such was the amazement that it\\ncaused him, and so great his marvel, that, recognizing his own error\\nand the foolish presumption of his own rash confidence, he took it\\ngreatly to heart, and in a very short time died of grief.\\n\\nRaffaello's panel was divine, not so much painted as alive, and so\\nwell wrought and coloured by him, that among all the beautiful\\npictures that he painted while he lived, although they are all\\nmiraculous, it could well be called most rare. Wherefore Francia,\\nhalf dead with terror at the beauty of the picture, which lay before\\nhis eyes challenging comparison with those by his own hand that he\\nsaw around him, felt all confounded, and had it placed with great\\ndiligence in that chapel of S. Giovanni in Monte for which it was\\ndestined; and taking to his bed in a few days almost beside himself,\\nthinking that he was now almost of no account in his art in\\ncomparison with the opinion held both by himself and by others, he\\ndied of grief and melancholy, so some believe, overtaken by the same\\nfate, through contemplating too attentively that most lifelike\\npicture of Raffaello's, as befell Fivizzano from feasting his eyes\\nwith his own beautiful Death, about which the following epigram was\\nwritten:\\n\\n  Me veram pictor divinus mente recepit;\\n    Admota est operi deinde perita manus.\\n  Dumque opere in facto defigit lumina pictor,\\n    Intentus nimium, palluit et moritur.\\n  Viva igitur sum mors, non mortua mortis imago,\\n    Si fungor quo mors fungitur officio.\\n\\nHowever, certain others say that his death was so sudden, that from\\nmany symptoms it appeared to be due rather to poison or apoplexy\\nthan to anything else. Francia was a prudent man, most regular in\\nhis way of life, and very robust. After his death, in the year 1518,\\nhe was honourably buried by his sons in Bologna.\\n\\n\\nPIETRO PERUGINO\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " ' OF PIETRO PERUGINO\\n\\n[_PIETRO VANNUCCI, OR PIETRO DA CASTEL DELLA PIEVE_]\\n\\nPAINTER\\n\\n\\nHow great a benefit poverty may be to men of genius, and how potent\\na force it may be to make them become excellent--nay, perfect--in\\nthe exercise of any faculty whatsoever, can be seen clearly enough\\nin the actions of Pietro Perugino, who, flying from the extremity of\\ndistress at Perugia, and betaking himself to Florence in the desire\\nto attain to some distinction by means of his talent, remained for\\nmany months without any other bed than a miserable chest to sleep\\nin, turning night into day, and devoting himself with the greatest\\nardour to the unceasing study of his profession. And, having made a\\nhabit of this, he knew no other pleasure than to labour continually\\nat his art, and to be for ever painting; for with the fear of\\npoverty constantly before his eyes, he would do for gain such work\\nas he would probably not have looked at if he had possessed the\\nwherewithal to live. Riches, indeed, might perchance have closed the\\npath on which his talent should advance towards excellence, no less\\neffectually than poverty opened it to him, while necessity spurred\\nhim on in his desire to rise from so low and miserable a condition,\\nif not to supreme eminence, at least to a rank in which he might\\nhave the means of life. For this reason he never took heed of cold,\\nof hunger, of hardship, of discomfort, of fatigue, or of ridicule,\\nif only he might one day live in ease and repose; ever saying, as it\\nwere by way of proverb, that after bad weather there must come the\\ngood, and that during the good men build the houses that are to\\nshelter them when there is need.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut in order that the rise of this craftsman may be better known, let\\nme begin with his origin, and relate that, according to common report,\\nthere was born in the city of Perugia, to a poor man of Castello\\ndella Pieve, named Cristofano, a son who was baptized with the name of\\nPietro. This son, brought up amid misery and distress, was given by\\nhis father as a shop-boy to a painter of Perugia, who was no great\\nmaster of his profession, but held in great veneration both the art\\nand the men who were excellent therein; nor did he ever cease to tell\\nPietro how much gain and honour painting brought to those who\\npractised it well, and he would urge the boy to the study of that art\\nby recounting to him the rewards won by ancient and modern masters;\\nwherefore he fired his mind in such a manner, that Pietro took it into\\nhis head to try, if only fortune would assist him, to become one of\\nthese. For this reason he was often wont to ask any man whom he knew\\nto have seen the world, in what part the best craftsmen in that\\ncalling were formed; particularly his master, who always gave him one\\nand the same answer--namely, that it was in Florence more than in any\\nother place that men became perfect in all the arts, especially in\\npainting, since in that city men are spurred by three things. The\\nfirst is censure, which is uttered freely and by many, seeing that the\\nair of that city makes men\\'s intellects so free by nature, that they\\ndo not content themselves, like a flock of sheep, with mediocre works,\\nbut ever consider them with regard to the honour of the good and the\\nbeautiful rather than out of respect for the craftsman. The second is\\nthat, if a man wishes to live there, he must be industrious, which is\\nnaught else than to say that he must continually exercise his\\nintelligence and his judgment, must be ready and adroit in his\\naffairs, and, finally, must know how to make money, seeing that the\\nterritory of Florence is not so wide or abundant as to enable her to\\nsupport at little cost all who live there, as can be done in countries\\nthat are rich enough. The third, which is perchance no less potent\\nthan the others, is an eager desire for glory and honour, which is\\ngenerated mightily by that air in the men of all professions; and this\\ndesire, in all persons of spirit, will not let them stay content with\\nbeing equal, much less inferior, to those whom they see to be men like\\nthemselves, although they may recognize them as masters--nay, it\\nforces them very often to desire their own advancement so eagerly,\\nthat, if they are not kindly or wise by nature, they turn out\\nevil-speakers, ungrateful, and unthankful for benefits. It is true,\\nindeed, that when a man has learnt there as much as suffices him, he\\nmust, if he wishes to do more than live from day to day like an\\nanimal, and desires to become rich, take his departure from that place\\nand find a sale abroad for the excellence of his works and for the\\nrepute conferred on him by that city, as the doctors do with the fame\\nderived from their studies. For Florence treats her craftsmen as time\\ntreats its own works, which when perfected, it destroys and consumes\\nlittle by little.\\n\\nMoved by these counsels, therefore, and by the persuasions of many\\nothers, Pietro came to Florence, minded to become excellent; and\\nwell did he succeed, for the reason that in those times works in his\\nmanner were held in very great price. He studied under the\\ndiscipline of Andrea Verrocchio, and his first figures were painted\\nwithout the Porta a Prato, in the Nunnery of S. Martino, now in\\nruins by reason of the wars. In Camaldoli he made a S. Jerome on a\\nwall, which was then much esteemed by the Florentines and celebrated\\nwith great praise, for the reason that he made that Saint old, lean,\\nand emaciated, with his eyes fixed on the Crucifix, and so wasted\\naway, that he seems like an anatomical model, as may be seen from a\\ncopy of that picture which is in the hands of the aforesaid\\nBartolommeo Gondi. In a few years, then, he came into such credit,\\nthat his works filled not only Florence and all Italy, but also\\nFrance, Spain, and many other countries to which they were sent.\\nWherefore, his paintings being held in very great price and repute,\\nmerchants began to buy them up wholesale and to send them abroad to\\nvarious countries, to their own great gain and profit.\\n\\nFor the Nuns of S. Chiara he painted a Dead Christ on a panel, with\\nsuch lovely and novel colouring, that he made the craftsmen believe\\nthat he would become excellent and marvellous. In this work there\\nare seen some most beautiful heads of old men, and likewise certain\\nfigures of the Maries, who, having ceased to weep, are contemplating\\nthe Dead Jesus with extraordinary awe and love; not to mention that\\nhe made therein a landscape that was then held most beautiful,\\nbecause the true method of making them, such as it appeared later,\\nhad not yet been seen. It is said that Francesco del Pugliese\\noffered to give to the aforesaid nuns three times as much money as\\nthey had paid to Pietro, and to have a similar one made for them by\\nthe same man\\'s hand, but that they would not consent, because Pietro\\nsaid that he did not believe he could equal it.\\n\\nThere were also many things by the hand of Pietro in the Convent of\\nthe Frati Gesuati, without the Porta a Pinti; and since the said\\nchurch and convent are now in ruins, I do not wish, with this\\noccasion, and before I proceed further with this Life, to grudge the\\nlabour of giving some little account of them. This church, then, the\\narchitect of which was Antonio di Giorgio of Settignano, was forty\\nbraccia long and twenty wide. At the upper end one ascended by four\\ntreads, or rather steps, to a platform six braccia in extent, on\\nwhich stood the high-altar, with many ornaments carved in stone; and\\non the said altar was a panel with a rich ornament, by the hand, as\\nhas been related, of Domenico Ghirlandajo. In the centre of the\\nchurch was a partition-wall, with a door wrought in open-work from\\nthe middle upwards, on either side of which was an altar, while over\\neither altar, as will be told, there stood a panel by the hand of\\nPietro Perugino. Over the said door was a most beautiful Crucifix by\\nthe hand of Benedetto da Maiano, with a Madonna on one side and a S.\\nJohn on the other, both in relief. Before the said platform of the\\nhigh-altar, and against the said partition-wall, was a choir of the\\nDoric Order, very well wrought in walnut-wood; and over the\\nprincipal door of the church there was another choir, which rested\\non well-strengthened woodwork, with the under part forming a\\nceiling, or rather soffit, beautifully partitioned, and with a row\\nof balusters acting as parapet to the front of the choir, which\\nfaced towards the high-altar. This choir was very convenient to the\\nfriars of that convent for holding their night services, for saying\\ntheir individual prayers, and likewise for week-days. Over the\\nprincipal door of the church--which was made with most beautiful\\nornaments of stone, and had a portico in front raised on columns,\\nwhich made a covered way as far as the door of the convent--was a\\nlunette with a very beautiful figure of S. Giusto, the Bishop, and\\nan angel on either side, by the hand of the illuminator Gherardo;\\nand this because that church was dedicated to the said S. Giusto,\\nand within it those friars preserved a relic of that Saint--that is,\\nan arm. At the entrance of the convent was a little cloister of\\nexactly the same size as the church--namely, forty braccia long and\\ntwenty wide--with arches and vaulting going right round and\\nsupported by columns of stone, thus making a spacious and most\\ncommodious loggia on every side. In the centre of the court of this\\ncloister, which was all neatly paved with squared stone, was a very\\nbeautiful well, with a loggia above, which likewise rested on\\ncolumns of stone, and made a rich and beautiful ornament. In this\\ncloister were the chapter-house of the friars, the side-door of\\nentrance into the church, and the stairs that ascended to the\\ndormitory and other rooms for the use of the friars. On the farther\\nside of this cloister, in a straight line with the principal door of\\nthe convent, was a passage as long as the chapter-house and the\\nsteward\\'s room put together, leading into another cloister larger\\nand more beautiful than the first; and the whole of this straight\\nline--that is, the forty braccia of the loggia of the first\\ncloister, the passage, and the line of the second cloister--made a\\nvery long enfilade, more beautiful than words can tell, and the\\nrather as from that farther cloister, in the same straight line,\\nthere issued a garden-walk two hundred braccia in length; and all\\nthis, as one came from the principal door of the convent, made a\\nmarvellous view. In the said second cloister was a refectory, sixty\\nbraccia long and eighteen wide, with all those well-appointed rooms,\\nand, as the friars call them, offices, which were required in such a\\nconvent. Over this was a dormitory in the shape of a =T=, one part\\nof which--namely, the principal part in the direct line, which was\\nsixty braccia long--was double--that is to say, it had cells on\\neither side, and at the upper end, in a space of fifteen braccia,\\nwas an oratory, over the altar of which there was a panel by the\\nhand of Pietro Perugino; and over the door of this oratory was\\nanother work by the same man\\'s hand, in fresco, as will be told. And\\non the same floor, above the chapter-house, was a large room where\\nthose fathers worked at making glass windows, with the little\\nfurnaces and other conveniences that were necessary for such an\\nindustry; and since while Pietro lived he made the cartoons for many\\nof their works, those that they executed in his time were all\\nexcellent. Then the garden of this convent was so beautiful and so\\nwell kept, and the vines were trained round the cloister and in\\nevery place with such good order, that nothing better could be seen\\nin the neighbourhood of Florence. In like manner the room wherein\\nthey distilled scented waters and medicines, as was their custom,\\nhad all the best conveniences that could possibly be imagined. In\\nshort, that convent was one of the most beautiful and best appointed\\nthat there were in the State of Florence; and it is for this reason\\nthat I have wished to make this record of it, and the rather as the\\ngreater part of the pictures that were therein were by the hand of\\nour Pietro Perugino.\\n\\n\\n\\nReturning at length to this Pietro, I have to say that of the works\\nthat he made in the said convent none have been preserved save the\\npanels, since those executed in fresco were thrown to the ground,\\ntogether with the whole of that building, by reason of the siege of\\nFlorence, when the panels were carried to the Porta a S. Pier\\nGattolini, where a home was given to those friars in the Church and\\nConvent of S. Giovannino. Now the two panels on the aforesaid\\npartition-wall were by the hand of Pietro; and in one was Christ in\\nthe Garden, with the Apostles sleeping, in whom Pietro showed how\\nwell sleep can prevail over pains and discomforts, having\\nrepresented them asleep in attitudes of perfect ease. In the other\\nhe made a Pietà--that is, Christ in the lap of Our Lady--surrounded\\nby four figures no less excellent than any others in his manner;\\nand, to mention only one thing, he made the Dead Christ all\\nstiffened, as if He had been so long on the Cross that the length of\\ntime and the cold had reduced Him to this; wherefore he painted Him\\nsupported by John and the Magdalene, all sorrowful and weeping. In\\nanother panel he painted the Crucifixion, with the Magdalene, and,\\nat the foot of the Cross, S. Jerome, S. John the Baptist, and the\\nBlessed Giovanni Colombini, founder of that Order; all with infinite\\ndiligence. These three panels have suffered considerably, and they\\nare all cracked in the dark parts and where there are shadows; and\\nthis comes to pass when the first coat of colour, which is laid on\\nthe ground (for three coats of colour are used, one over the other),\\nis worked on before it is thoroughly dry; wherefore afterwards, with\\ntime, in the drying, they draw through their thickness and come to\\nhave the strength to make those cracks; which Pietro could not\\nknow, seeing that in his time they were only just beginning to paint\\nwell in oil.\\n\\nNow, the works of Pietro being much commended by the Florentines, a\\nPrior of the same Convent of the Ingesuati, who took delight in art,\\ncaused him to make a Nativity, with the Magi, on a wall in the first\\ncloister, after the manner of a miniature. This he brought to\\nperfect completion with great loveliness and a high finish, and it\\ncontained an infinite number of different heads, many of them\\nportrayed from life, among which was the head of Andrea del\\nVerrocchio, his master. In the same court, over the arches of the\\ncolumns, he made a frieze with heads of the size of life, very well\\nexecuted, among which was one of the said Prior, so lifelike and\\nwrought in so good a manner, that it was judged by the most\\nexperienced craftsmen to be the best thing that Pietro ever made. In\\nthe other cloister, over the door that led into the refectory, he\\nwas commissioned to paint a scene of Pope Boniface confirming the\\nhabit of his Order to the Blessed Giovanni Colombino, wherein he\\nportrayed eight of the aforesaid friars, and made a most beautiful\\nview receding in perspective, which was much extolled, and rightly,\\nsince Pietro made a particular profession of this. In another scene\\nbelow the first he began a Nativity of Christ, with certain angels\\nand shepherds, wrought with the freshest colouring. And in an arch\\nover the door of the aforesaid oratory he made three half-length\\nfigures--Our Lady, S. Jerome, and the Blessed Giovanni--with so\\nbeautiful a manner, that this was held to be one of the best mural\\npaintings that Pietro ever wrought.\\n\\nThe said Prior, so I once heard tell, was very excellent at making\\nultramarine blues, and, therefore, having an abundance of them, he\\ndesired that Pietro should use them freely in all the above-mentioned\\nworks; but he was nevertheless so mean and suspicious that he would\\nnever trust Pietro, and always insisted on being present when he was\\nusing blue in the work. Wherefore Pietro, who had an honest and\\nupright nature, and had no desire for another man\\'s goods save in\\nreturn for his own labour, took the Prior\\'s distrust very ill, and\\nresolved to put him to shame; and so, having taken a basin of water,\\nand having laid on the ground for draperies or for anything else that\\nhe wished to paint in blue and white, from time to time he caused the\\nPrior, who turned grudgingly to his little bag, to put some\\nultramarine into the little vase that contained the tempera-water, and\\nthen, setting to work, at every second stroke of the brush Pietro\\nwould dip his brush in the basin, so that there remained more in the\\nwater than he had used on the picture. The Prior, who saw his little\\nbag becoming empty without much to show for it in the work, kept\\nsaying time after time: \"Oh, what a quantity of ultramarine this\\nplaster consumes!\" \"Does it not?\" Pietro would answer. After the\\ndeparture of the Prior, Pietro took the ultramarine from the bottom of\\nthe basin, and gave it back to him when he thought the time had come,\\nsaying: \"Father, this is yours; learn to trust honest men, who never\\ncheat those who trust them, although, if they wished, they could cheat\\nsuch distrustful persons as yourself.\"\\n\\nBy reason of these works, then, and many others, Pietro came into\\nsuch repute that he was almost forced to go to Siena, where he\\npainted a large panel, which was held very beautiful, in S.\\nFrancesco; and he painted another in S. Agostino, containing a\\nCrucifix with some saints. A little time after this, for the Church\\nof S. Gallo in Florence, he painted a panel-picture of S. Jerome in\\nPenitence, which is now in S. Jacopo tra Fossi, where the aforesaid\\nfriars live, near the Canto degli Alberti. He was commissioned to\\npaint a Dead Christ, with the Madonna and S. John, above the steps\\nof the side-door of S. Pietro Maggiore; and this he wrought in such\\na manner, that it has been preserved, although exposed to rain and\\nwind, as fresh as if it had only just been finished by Pietro\\'s\\nhand. Truly intelligent was Pietro\\'s understanding of colour, both\\nin fresco and in oil; wherefore all experienced craftsmen are\\nindebted to him, for it is through him that they have knowledge of\\nthe lights that are seen throughout his works.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn S. Croce, in the same city, he made a Pietà--that is, Our Lady\\nwith the Dead Christ in her arms--and two figures, which are\\nmarvellous to behold, not so much for their excellence, as for the\\nfact that they have remained so fresh and vivid in colouring,\\npainted as they are in fresco. He was commissioned by Bernardino de\\'\\nRossi, a citizen of Florence, to paint a S. Sebastian to be\\nsent into France, the price agreed on being one hundred gold crowns;\\nbut this work was sold by Bernardino to the King of France for four\\nhundred gold ducats. At Vallombrosa he painted a panel for the\\nhigh-altar; and in the Certosa of Pavia, likewise, he executed a\\npanel for the friars of that place. At the command of Cardinal\\nCaraffa of Naples he painted an Assumption of Our Lady, with the\\nApostles marvelling round the tomb, for the high-altar of the\\nPiscopio; and for Abbot Simone de\\' Graziani of Borgo a San Sepolcro\\nhe executed a large panel, which was painted in Florence, and then\\nborne to S. Gilio in the Borgo on the shoulders of porters, at very\\ngreat expense. To S. Giovanni in Monte at Bologna he sent a panel\\nwith certain figures standing upright, and a Madonna in the sky.\\n\\n\\n\\nThereupon the fame of Pietro spread so widely throughout Italy and\\nabroad, that to his great glory he was summoned to Rome by Pope\\nSixtus IV to work in his chapel in company with the other excellent\\ncraftsmen. There, in company with Don Bartolommeo della Gatta, Abbot\\nof S. Clemente at Arezzo, he painted the scene of Christ giving the\\nkeys to S. Peter; and likewise the Nativity and Baptism of Christ,\\nand the Birth of Moses, with the daughter of Pharaoh finding him in\\nthe little ark. And on the same wall where the altar is he painted a\\nmural picture of the Assumption of Our Lady, with a portrait of Pope\\nSixtus on his knees. But these works were thrown to the ground in\\npreparing the wall for the Judgment of the divine Michelagnolo, in\\nthe time of Pope Paul III. On a vault of the Borgia Tower in the\\nPapal Palace he painted certain stories of Christ, with some foliage\\nin chiaroscuro, which had an extraordinary name for excellence in\\nhis time. In S. Marco, likewise in Rome, he painted a story of two\\nmartyrs beside the Sacrament--one of the best works that he made in\\nRome. For Sciarra Colonna, also, in the Palace of S. Apostolo, he\\npainted a loggia and certain rooms.\\n\\nThese works brought him a very great sum of money; wherefore, having\\nresolved to remain no longer in Rome, and having departed in good\\nfavour with the whole Court, he returned to his native city of\\nPerugia, in many parts of which he executed panels and works in\\nfresco; and, in particular, a panel-picture painted in oils for the\\nChapel of the Palace of the Signori, containing Our Lady and other\\nsaints. In S. Francesco del Monte he painted two chapels in fresco,\\none with the story of the Magi going to make offering to Christ, and\\nthe other with the martyrdom of certain friars of S. Francis, who,\\ngoing to the Soldan of Babylon, were put to death. In S. Francesco\\ndel Convento, likewise, he painted two panels in oil, one with the\\nResurrection of Christ, and the other with S. John the Baptist and\\nother saints. For the Church of the Servi he also painted two\\npanels, one of the Transfiguration of Our Lord, and in the other,\\nwhich is beside the sacristy, the Story of the Magi; but, since\\nthese are not of the same excellence as the other works of Pietro,\\nit is held to be certain that they are among the first that he made.\\nIn the Chapel of the Crocifisso in S. Lorenzo, the Duomo of the same\\ncity, there are by the hand of Pietro the Madonna, the other Maries,\\nS. John, S. Laurence, S. James, and other saints. And for the Altar\\nof the Sacrament, where there is preserved the ring with which the\\nVirgin Mary was married, he painted the Marriage of the Virgin.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfterwards he painted in fresco the whole of the Audience Chamber of\\nthe Cambio, adorning the compartments of the vaulting with the\\nseven planets, drawn in certain cars by diverse animals, according\\nto the old usage; on the wall opposite to the door of entrance he\\npainted the Nativity and Resurrection of Christ, with a panel\\ncontaining S. John the Baptist in the midst of certain other saints.\\nThe side-walls he painted in his own manner; one with figures of\\nFabius Maximus, Socrates, Numa Pompilius, F. Camillus, Pythagoras,\\nTrajan, L. Sicinius, the Spartan Leonidas, Horatius Cocles, Fabius,\\nSempronius, the Athenian Pericles, and Cincinnatus. On the other\\nwall he made the Prophets, Isaiah, Moses, Daniel, David, Jeremiah,\\nand Solomon; and the Sibyls, the Erythræan, the Libyan, the\\nTiburtine, the Delphic, and the others. Below each of the said\\nfigures he placed, in the form of a written motto, something said by\\nthem, and appropriate to that place. And in one of the ornaments he\\nmade his own portrait, which appears absolutely alive, and he wrote\\nhis own name below it in the following manner:\\n\\n  PETRUS PERUSINUS EGREGIUS PICTOR.\\n  PERDITA SI FUERAT, PINGENDO HIC RETULIT ARTEM;\\n  SI NUNQUAM INVENTA ESSET HACTENUS, IPSE DEDIT.\\n  ANNO D. 1500.\\n\\nThis work, which was very beautiful and more highly extolled than\\nany other that was executed by Pietro in Perugia, is now held in\\ngreat price by the men of that city in memory of so famous a\\ncraftsman of their own country. Afterwards, in the principal chapel\\nof the Church of S. Agostino, the same man executed a large panel\\nstanding by itself and surrounded by a rich ornament, with S. John\\nbaptizing Christ on the front part, and on the back--that is, on the\\nside that faces the choir--the Nativity of Christ, with certain\\nsaints in the upper parts, and in the predella many scenes wrought\\nvery diligently with little figures. And in the Chapel of S.\\nNiccolò, in the said church, he painted a panel for Messer Benedetto\\nCalera.\\n\\nAfter this, returning to Florence, he painted a S. Bernard on a\\npanel for the Monks of Cestello, and in the chapter-house a\\nCrucifix, the Madonna, S. Benedict, S. Bernard, and S. John. And in\\nS. Domenico da Fiesole, in the second chapel on the right hand, he\\npainted a panel containing Our Lady and three figures, among which\\nis a S. Sebastian worthy of the highest praise. Now Pietro had done\\nso much work, and he always had so many works in hand, that he would\\nvery often use the same subjects; and he had reduced the theory of\\nhis art to a manner so fixed, that he made all his figures with the\\nsame expression. By that time Michelagnolo Buonarroti had already\\ncome to the front, and Pietro greatly desired to see his figures, by\\nreason of the praise bestowed on him by craftsmen; and seeing the\\ngreatness of his own name, which he had acquired in every place\\nthrough so grand a beginning, being obscured, he was ever seeking to\\nwound his fellow-workers with biting words. For this reason, besides\\ncertain insults aimed at him by the craftsmen, he had only himself\\nto blame when Michelagnolo told him in public that he was a clumsy\\nfool at his art. But Pietro being unable to swallow such an affront,\\nthey both appeared before the Tribunal of Eight, where Pietro came\\noff with little honour. Meanwhile the Servite Friars of Florence,\\nwishing to have the altar-piece of their high-altar painted by some\\nfamous master, had handed it over, by reason of the departure of\\nLeonardo da Vinci, who had gone off to France, to Filippino; but he,\\nwhen he had finished half of one of two panels that were to adorn\\nthe altar, passed from this life to the next; wherefore the friars,\\nby reason of the faith that they had in Pietro, entrusted him with\\nthe whole work. In that panel, wherein he was painting the\\nDeposition of Christ from the Cross, Filippino had finished the\\nfigures of Nicodemus that are taking Him down; and Pietro continued\\nthe lower part with the Swooning of the Madonna, and certain other\\nfigures. Now this work was to be composed of two panels, one facing\\ntowards the choir of the friars, and the other towards the body of\\nthe church, and the Deposition from the Cross was to be placed\\nbehind, facing the choir, with the Assumption of Our Lady in front;\\nbut Pietro made the latter so commonplace, that the Deposition of\\nChrist was placed in front, and the Assumption on the side of the\\nchoir. These panels have now been removed, both one and the other,\\nand replaced by the Tabernacle of the Sacrament; they have been set\\nup over certain other altars in that church, and out of the whole\\nwork there only remain six pictures, wherein are some saints painted\\nby Pietro in certain niches. It is said that when the work was\\nunveiled, it received no little censure from all the new craftsmen,\\nparticularly because Pietro had availed himself of those figures\\nthat he had been wont to use in other pictures; with which his\\nfriends twitted him, saying that he had taken no pains, and that he\\nhad abandoned the good method of working, either through avarice or\\nto save time. To this Pietro would answer: \"I have used the figures\\nthat you have at other times praised, and which have given you\\ninfinite pleasure; if now they do not please you, and you do not\\npraise them, what can I do?\" But they kept assailing him bitterly\\nwith sonnets and open insults; whereupon, although now old, he\\ndeparted from Florence and returned to Perugia.\\n\\nThere he executed certain works in fresco in the Church of S.\\nSevero, a place belonging to the Monks of the Order of Camaldoli,\\nwherein Raffaello da Urbino, when quite young and still the disciple\\nof Pietro, had painted certain figures, as will be told in his Life.\\nPietro likewise worked at Montone, at La Fratta, and in many other\\nplaces in the district of Perugia; more particularly in S. Maria\\ndegli Angeli at Assisi, where he painted in fresco a Christ on the\\nCross, with many figures, on the wall at the back of the Chapel of\\nthe Madonna, which faces the choir of the monks. And for the\\nhigh-altar of the Church of S. Pietro, an abbey of Black Friars in\\nPerugia, he painted a large panel containing the Ascension, with the\\nApostles below gazing up to Heaven; in the predella of which panel\\nare three stories, wrought with much diligence--namely, that of the\\nMagi, the Baptism of Christ, and His Resurrection. The whole of this\\npicture is seen to be full of beautiful and careful work, insomuch\\nthat it is the best of those wrought in oil by the hand of Pietro\\nwhich are in Perugia. The same man began a work in fresco of no\\nsmall importance at Castello della Pieve, but did not finish it.\\n\\nIt was ever Pietro\\'s custom on his going and coming between the said\\nCastello and Perugia, like a man who trusted nobody, to carry all\\nthe money that he possessed about his person. Wherefore certain men,\\nlying in wait for him at a pass, robbed him, but at his earnest\\nentreaty they spared his life for the love of God; and afterwards,\\nby means of the services of his friends, who were numerous enough,\\nhe also recovered a great part of the money that had been taken from\\nhim; but none the less he came near dying of vexation. Pietro was a\\nman of very little religion, and he could never be made to believe\\nin the immortality of the soul--nay, with words in keeping with his\\nhead of granite, he rejected most obstinately every good suggestion.\\nHe placed all his hopes in the goods of fortune, and he would have\\nsold his soul for money. He earned great riches; and he both bought\\nand built houses in Florence, and acquired much settled property\\nboth at Perugia and at Castello della Pieve. He took a most\\nbeautiful young woman to wife, and had children by her; and he\\ndelighted so greatly in seeing her wearing beautiful head-dresses,\\nboth abroad and at home, that it is said that he would often tire\\nher head with his own hand. Finally, having reached the age of\\nseventy-eight, Pietro finished the course of his life at Castello\\ndella Pieve, where he was honourably buried, in the year 1524.\\n\\nPietro made many masters in his own manner, and one among them, who\\nwas truly most excellent, devoted himself heart and soul to the\\nhonourable studies of painting, and surpassed his master by a great\\nmeasure; and this was the miraculous Raffaello Sanzio of Urbino, who\\nworked for many years under Pietro in company with his father,\\nGiovanni de\\' Santi. Another disciple of this man was Pinturicchio, a\\npainter of Perugia, who, as it has been said in his Life, ever held\\nto Pietro\\'s manner. His disciple, likewise, was Rocco Zoppo, a\\npainter of Florence, by whose hand is a very beautiful Madonna in a\\nround picture, which is in the possession of Filippo Salviati;\\nalthough it is true that it was brought to completion by Pietro\\nhimself. The same Rocco painted many pictures of Our Lady, and made\\nmany portraits, of which there is no need to speak; I will only say\\nthat in the Sistine Chapel in Rome he painted portraits of Girolamo\\nRiario and of F. Pietro, Cardinal of San Sisto. Another disciple of\\nPietro was Montevarchi, who painted many pictures in San Giovanni di\\nValdarno; more particularly, in the Madonna, the stories of the\\nMiracle of the Milk. He also left many works in Montevarchi, his\\nbirth-place. Likewise a pupil of Pietro\\'s, working with him for no\\nlittle time, was Gerino da Pistoia, of whom there has been mention\\nin the Life of Pinturicchio; and so also was Baccio Ubertino of\\nFlorence, who was most diligent both in colouring and in drawing,\\nfor which reason Pietro made much use of him. By this man\\'s hand is\\na drawing in our book, done with the pen, of Christ being scourged\\nat the Column, which is a very lovely thing.\\n\\n\\n\\nA brother of this Baccio, and likewise a disciple of Pietro, was\\nFrancesco, called Il Bacchiaccha by way of surname, who was a most\\ndiligent master of little figures, as may be seen in many works\\nwrought by him in Florence, above all in the house of Giovan Maria\\nBenintendi and in that of Pier Francesco Borgherini. Bacchiaccha\\ndelighted in painting grotesques, wherefore he covered a little\\ncabinet belonging to the Lord Duke Cosimo with animals and rare\\nplants, drawn from nature, which are held very beautiful. Besides\\nthis, he made the cartoons for many tapestries, which were\\nafterwards woven in silk by the Flemish master, Giovanni Rosto, for\\nthe apartments of his Excellency\\'s Palace. Still another disciple of\\nPietro was the Spaniard Giovanni, called Lo Spagna by way of\\nsurname, who was a better colourist than any of the others whom\\nPietro left behind him at his death; after which this Giovanni would\\nhave settled in Perugia, if the envy of the painters of that city,\\nso hostile to strangers, had not persecuted him in such wise as to\\nforce him to retire to Spoleto, where, by reason of his excellence\\nand virtue, he obtained a wife of good family and was made a citizen\\nof that city. He made many works in that place, and likewise in all\\nthe other cities of Umbria; and at Assisi, in the lower Church of S.\\nFrancesco, he painted the panel of the Chapel of S. Caterina, for\\nthe Spanish Cardinal Egidio, and also one in S. Damiano. In S. Maria\\ndegli Angeli, in the little chapel where S. Francis died, he painted\\nsome half-length figures of the size of life--that is, certain\\ncompanions of S. Francis and other saints--all very lifelike, on\\neither side of a S. Francis in relief.\\n\\nBut the best master among all the aforesaid disciples of Pietro was\\nAndrea Luigi of Assisi, called L\\'Ingegno, who in his early youth\\ncompeted with Raffaello da Urbino under the discipline of Pietro,\\nwho always employed him in the most important pictures that he made;\\nas may be seen in the Audience Chamber of the Cambio in Perugia,\\nwhere there are some very beautiful figures by his hand; in those\\nthat he wrought at Assisi; and, finally, in the Chapel of Pope\\nSixtus at Rome. In all these works Andrea gave such proof of his\\nworth, that he was expected to surpass his master by a great\\nmeasure, and so, without a doubt, it would have come to pass; but\\nfortune, which is almost always pleased to oppose herself to lofty\\nbeginnings, did not allow L\\'Ingegno to reach perfection, for a flux\\nof catarrh fell upon his eyes, whence the poor fellow became wholly\\nblind, to the infinite grief of all who knew him. Hearing of this\\nmost pitiful misfortune, Pope Sixtus, like a man who ever loved men\\nof talent, ordained that a yearly provision should be paid to Andrea\\nin Assisi during his lifetime by those who managed the revenues\\nthere; and this was done until he died at the age of eighty-six.\\n\\nLikewise disciples of Pietro, and also natives of Perugia, were\\nEusebio San Giorgio, who painted the panel of the Magi in S.\\nAgostino; Domenico di Paris, who made many works in Perugia and in\\nthe neighbouring townships, being followed by his brother Orazio;\\nand also Gian Niccola, who painted Christ in the Garden on a panel\\nin S. Francesco, the panel of Ognissanti in the Chapel of the\\nBaglioni in S. Domenico, and stories of S. John the Baptist in\\nfresco in the Chapel of the Cambio. Benedetto Caporali, otherwise\\ncalled Bitti, was also a disciple of Pietro, and there are many\\npictures by his hand in his native city of Perugia. And he occupied\\nhimself so greatly with architecture, that he not only executed many\\nworks, but also wrote a commentary on Vitruvius in the manner that\\nall can see, for it is printed; in which studies he was followed by\\nhis son Giulio, a painter of Perugia.\\n\\nBut not one out of all these disciples ever equalled Pietro\\'s\\ndiligence, or the grace of colouring that he showed in that manner\\nof his own, which pleased his time so much, that many came from\\nFrance, from Spain, from Germany, and from other lands, to learn it.\\nAnd a trade was done in his works, as has been said, by many who\\nsent them to diverse places, until there came the manner of\\nMichelagnolo, which, having shown the true and good path to these\\narts, has brought them to that perfection which will be seen in the\\nThird Part, about to follow, wherein we will treat of the excellence\\nand perfection of art, and show to craftsmen that he who labours and\\nstudies continuously, and not in the way of fantasy or caprice,\\nleaves true works behind him and acquires fame, wealth, and\\nfriends.\\n\\n\\nVITTORE SCARPACCIA (CARPACCIO), AND OTHER VENETIAN AND LOMBARD\\nPAINTERS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " \" OF VITTORE SCARPACCIA (CARPACCIO), AND OF OTHER VENETIAN AND\\nLOMBARD PAINTERS\\n\\n\\nIt is very well known that when some of our craftsmen make a\\nbeginning in some province, they are afterwards followed by many,\\none after another; and very often there is an infinite number of\\nthem at one and the same time, for the reason that rivalry,\\nemulation, and the fact that they have been dependent on others, one\\non one excellent master, and one on another, bring it about that the\\ncraftsmen seek with all the greater effort to surpass one another,\\nto the utmost of their ability. And even when many depend on one, no\\nsooner do they separate, either at the death of their master or for\\nsome other reason, than they straightway also separate in aim;\\nwhereupon each seeks to prove his own worth, in order to appear\\nbetter than the rest and a master by himself.\\n\\nOf many, then, who flourished almost at one and the same time and in\\none and the same province, and about whom I have not been able to\\nlearn and am not able to write every particular, I will give some\\nbrief account, to the end that, now that I find myself at the end of\\nthe Second Part of this my work, I may not omit some who have\\nlaboured to leave the world adorned by their works. Of these men, I\\nsay, besides having been unable to discover their whole history, I\\nhave not even been able to find the portraits, excepting that of\\nScarpaccia, whom for this reason I have made head of the others. Let\\nmy readers therefore accept what I can offer in this connection,\\nseeing that I cannot offer what I would wish. There lived, then, in\\nthe March of Treviso and in Lombardy, during a period of many years,\\nStefano Veronese, Aldigieri da Zevio, Jacopo Davanzo of Bologna,\\nSebeto da Verona, Jacobello de Flore, Guerriero da Padova, Giusto,\\nGirolamo Campagnola and his son Giulio, and Vincenzio Bresciano;\\nVittore, Sebastiano, and Lazzaro Scarpaccia, Venetians;\\nVincenzio Catena, Luigi Vivarini, Giovan Battista da Conigliano,\\nMarco Basarini, Giovanetto Cordegliaghi, Il Bassiti, Bartolommeo\\nVivarini, Giovanni Mansueti, Vittore Bellini, Bartolommeo Montagna\\nof Vicenza, Benedetto Diana, and Giovanni Buonconsigli, with many\\nothers, of whom there is no need to make mention here.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo begin with the first, I start by saying that Stefano Veronese, of\\nwhom I gave some account in the Life of Agnolo Gaddi, was a painter\\nmore than passing good in his day. And when Donatello was working in\\nPadua, as has been already told in his Life, going on one of several\\noccasions to Verona, he was struck with marvel at the works of\\nStefano, declaring that the pictures which he had made in fresco\\nwere the best that had been wrought in those parts up to that time.\\nThe first works of this man were in the tramezzo of the Church of\\nS. Antonio at Verona, at the top of a wall on the left, below the\\ncurve of a part of the vaulting; and the subjects were a Madonna\\nwith the Child in her arms, and S. James and S. Anthony, one on\\neither side of her. This work is held very beautiful in that city\\neven at the present day, by reason of a certain liveliness that is\\nseen in the said figures, particularly in the heads, which are\\nwrought with much grace. In S. Niccolò, a parish church of that\\ncity, likewise, he painted a S. Nicholas in fresco, which is very\\nbeautiful. On the front of a house in the Via di S. Polo, which\\nleads to the Porta del Vescovo, he painted the Virgin, with certain\\nvery beautiful angels and a S. Christopher; and over the wall of the\\nChurch of S. Consolata in the Via del Duomo, in a recess made in the\\nwall, he painted a Madonna and certain birds, in particular a\\npeacock, his emblem. In S. Eufemia, a convent of the Eremite Friars\\nof S. Augustine, he painted over the side-door a S. Augustine with\\ntwo other saints, and under the mantle of this S. Augustine are many\\nfriars and nuns of his Order; but the most beautiful things in this\\nwork are two half-length prophets of the size of life, for the\\nreason that they have the most beautiful and most lifelike heads\\nthat Stefano ever made; and the colouring of the whole work,\\nhaving been executed with diligence, has remained beautiful even to\\nour own day, notwithstanding that it has been much exposed to rain,\\nwind, and frost. If this work had been under cover, it would still\\nbe as beautiful and fresh as it issued from his hands, for the\\nreason that Stefano did not retouch it on the dry, but used\\ndiligence in executing it well in fresco; as it is, it has suffered\\na little. Within the church, in the Chapel of the Sacrament--namely,\\nround the Tabernacle--he afterwards painted certain angels flying,\\nsome of whom are sounding instruments, some singing, and others\\nburning incense before the Sacrament; together with a figure of\\nJesus Christ, which he painted at the top as a finish to the\\nTabernacle. Below there are other angels, who are supporting Him,\\nclothed in white garments reaching to their feet, and ending, as it\\nwere, in clouds, which was an idea peculiar to Stefano in painting\\nfigures of angels, whom he always made most gracious in countenance\\nand very beautiful in expression. In this same work are life-size\\nfigures of S. Augustine and S. Jerome, one on either side; and these\\nare supporting with their hands the Church of God, as if to show\\nthat both of them defend Holy Church from heretics with their\\nlearning, and support her. On a pilaster of the principal chapel in\\nthe same church he painted a S. Eufemia in fresco, with a beautiful\\nand gracious expression of countenance; and there he wrote his own\\nname in letters of gold, perchance since it appeared to him to be,\\nas in fact it is, one of the best pictures that he had made; and\\naccording to his custom he painted there a very beautiful peacock,\\nand beside it two lion cubs, which are not very beautiful, because\\nat that time he could not see live ones, as he saw the peacock. He\\nalso painted for the same place a panel containing, as was the\\ncustom in those times, many half-length figures, such as S. Niccola\\nda Tolentino and others; and he filled the predella with scenes in\\nlittle figures from the life of that Saint. In S. Fermo, a church in\\nthe same city belonging to the Friars of S. Francis, he painted, as\\nan ornament for a Deposition from the Cross on the wall opposite to\\nthe side-door of entrance, twelve half-length prophets of the size\\nof life, with Adam and Eve lying below them, and his usual peacock,\\nwhich is almost the hall-mark of pictures executed by him.\\n\\nIn Mantua, at the Martello gate of the Church of S. Domenico, the\\nsame Stefano painted a most beautiful Madonna; the head of which\\nMadonna, when they had need to build in that place, those fathers\\nplaced with care in the tramezzo of the church--that is, in the\\nChapel of S. Orsola, which belongs to the Recuperati family, and\\ncontains some pictures in fresco by the hand of the same man. And in\\nthe Church of S. Francesco, on the right hand as one enters by the\\nprincipal door, there is a row of chapels formerly built by the\\nnoble Della Ramma family, in one of which are seated figures of the\\nfour Evangelists, painted on the vaulting by the hand of Stefano;\\nand behind their shoulders, for a background, he made certain\\nespaliers of roses, with a cane trellis-work in a pattern of\\nmandorle, above which are various trees and other greenery full of\\nbirds, particularly of peacocks; and there are also some very\\nbeautiful angels. In this same church, on a column on the right hand\\nas one enters, he painted a life-size figure of S. Mary Magdalene.\\nAnd in the same city, on the frontal of a door in the street called\\nRompilanza, he painted in fresco a Madonna with the Child in her\\narms, and some angels kneeling before her; and the background he\\nmade of trees covered with fruit.\\n\\nThese, then, are the works that are found to have been executed by\\nStefano, although it may well be believed, since his life was not a\\nshort one, that he made many others. But even as I have not been\\nable to discover any more of them, so I have failed to find his\\nsurname, his father's name, his portrait, or any other particulars.\\nSome declare that before he came to Florence he was a disciple of\\nMaestro Liberale, a painter of Verona; but this matters nothing. It\\nis enough that he learnt all that there was of the good in him from\\nAgnolo Gaddi in Florence.\\n\\n\\n\\nOf the same city of Verona was Aldigieri da Zevio, who was very much\\nthe friend of the Signori della Scala, and who, besides many other\\nworks, painted the Great Hall of their Palace (which is now the\\nhabitation of the Podestà), depicting therein the War of Jerusalem,\\naccording as it is described by Josephus. In this work Aldigieri\\nshowed great spirit and judgment, distributing one scene over the\\nwalls of that hall on every side, with a single ornament encircling\\nit right round; on the upper part of which ornament, as it were to\\nset it off, he placed a row of medallions, in which it is believed\\nthat there are the portraits from life of many distinguished men of\\nthose times, particularly of many of those Signori della Scala; but,\\nsince the truth about this is not known, I will say no more of it. I\\nmust say, indeed, that Aldigieri showed in this work that he had\\nintelligence, judgment, and invention, seeing that he took into\\nconsideration all the things that can be taken into consideration in\\na serious war. Besides this, the colouring has remained very fresh;\\nand among many portraits of men of distinction and learning, there\\nis seen that of Messer Francesco Petrarca.\\n\\nJacopo Avanzi, a painter of Bologna, shared the work of this hall\\nwith Aldigieri, and below the aforesaid pictures he painted two most\\nbeautiful Triumphs, likewise in fresco, with so much art and so good\\na manner, that Girolamo Campagnola declares that Mantegna used to\\npraise them as pictures of the rarest merit. The same Jacopo,\\ntogether with Aldigieri and Sebeto da Verona, painted the Chapel of\\nS. Giorgio, which is beside the Church of S. Antonio, in Padua,\\naccording to the directions left in the testaments of the Marquesses\\nof Carrara. Jacopo Avanzi painted the upper part; below this were\\ncertain stories of S. Lucia, with a Last Supper, by Aldigieri; and\\nSebeto painted stories of S. John. Afterwards these three masters,\\nhaving all returned to Verona, joined together to paint a\\nwedding-feast, with many portraits and costumes of those times, in\\nthe house of the Counts Serenghi. Now the work of Jacopo Avanzi was\\nheld to be the best of all; but, since mention has been made of him\\nin the Life of Niccolò d' Arezzo by reason of the works that he made\\nin Bologna in competition with the painters Simone, Cristofano, and\\nGalasso, I will say no more about him in this place.\\n\\nA man who was held in esteem at Venice about the same time, although\\nhe adhered to the Greek manner, was Jacobello de Flore, who made a\\nnumber of works in that city; in particular, a panel for the Nuns of\\nthe Corpus Domini, which stands on the altar of S. Domenico in their\\nchurch. A competitor of this master was Giromin Morzone, who painted\\na number of pictures in Venice and in many cities of Lombardy; but,\\nsince he held to the old manner and made all his figures on tiptoe,\\nwe will say nothing about him, save that there is a panel by his\\nhand, with many saints, on the Altar of the Assumption in the Church\\nof S. Lena.\\n\\nA much better master than Morzone was Guerriero, a painter of Padua,\\nwho, besides many other works, painted the principal chapel of the\\nEremite Friars of S. Augustine in Padua, and a chapel for the same\\nfriars in the first cloister. He also painted a little chapel in the\\nhouse of the Urban Prefect, and the Hall of the Roman Emperors,\\nwhere the students go to dance at the time of the Carnival. He also\\npainted in fresco, in the Chapel of the Podestà of the same city,\\nsome scenes from the Old Testament.\\n\\nGiusto, likewise a painter of Padua, painted in the Chapel of S.\\nGiovanni Battista, without the Church of the Vescovado, not only\\ncertain scenes from the Old Testament and the New, but also the\\nRevelations of the Apocalypse of S. John the Evangelist; and in the\\nupper part he made a Paradise containing many choirs of angels and\\nother adornments, wrought with beautiful conceptions. In the Church\\nof S. Antonio he painted in fresco the Chapel of S. Luca; and in a\\nchapel in the Church of the Eremite Friars of S. Augustine he\\npainted the liberal arts, with the virtues and vices beside them,\\nand likewise those who have been celebrated for their virtues, and\\nthose who have fallen by reason of their vices into the extreme of\\nmisery and into the lowest depth of Hell.\\n\\nThere was working in Padua, in this man's time, Stefano, a painter\\nof Ferrara, who, as has been said elsewhere, adorned with various\\npictures the chapel and the tomb wherein is the body of S. Anthony,\\nand also painted the Virgin Mary that is called the Vergine del\\nPilastro.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnother man who was held in esteem in the same times was Vincenzio,\\na painter of Brescia, according to the account of Filarete, as was\\nalso Girolamo Campagnola, another Paduan painter, and a disciple of\\nSquarcione. Then Giulio, son of Girolamo, made many beautiful works\\nof painting, illumination, and copper-engraving, both in Padua and\\nin other places. In the same city of Padua many things were\\nwrought by Niccolò Moreto, who lived eighty years, and never ceased\\nto exercise his art.\\n\\n\\n\\nBesides these there were many others, who were connected with\\nGentile and Giovanni Bellini; but Vittore Scarpaccia was truly the\\nfirst among them who made works of importance. His first works were\\nin the Scuola of S. Orsola, where he painted on canvas the greater\\npart of the stories that are there, representing the life and death\\nof that Saint; the labours of which pictures he contrived to carry\\nout so well and with such great diligence and art, that he acquired\\nthereby the name of a very good and practised master. This, so it is\\nsaid, was the reason that the people of Milan caused him to paint a\\npanel in distemper with many figures for the Friars Minor, in their\\nChapel of S. Ambrogio. On the altar of the Risen Christ in the\\nChurch of S. Antonio he painted the scene of Christ appearing to the\\nMagdalene and the other Maries, in which he made a very beautiful\\nview in perspective of a landscape receding into the distance; and\\nin another chapel he painted the story of the Martyrs--that is,\\ntheir crucifixion--in which work he made more than three hundred\\nfigures, what with the large and the small, besides a number of\\nhorses and trees, an open Heaven, figures both nude and clothed in\\ndiverse attitudes, many foreshortenings, and so many other things,\\nthat it can be seen that he did not execute it without extraordinary\\nlabour. For the altar of the Madonna, in the Church of S. Giobbe in\\nCanareio, he painted her presenting the Infant Christ to Simeon, and\\ndepicted the Madonna herself standing, and Simeon in his cope\\nbetween two ministers clothed as Cardinals; behind the Virgin are\\ntwo women, one of whom has two doves, and below are three boys, who\\nare playing on a lute, a serpent, and a lyre, or rather a viol; and\\nthe colouring of the whole panel is very charming and beautiful.\\nAnd, in truth, Vittore was a very diligent and practised master, and\\nmany pictures by his hand that are in Venice, both portraits from\\nlife and other kinds, are much esteemed for works wrought in those\\ntimes. He taught his art to two brothers of his own, who imitated\\nhim closely, one being Lazzaro, and the other Sebastiano; and by\\ntheir hand is a panel on the altar of the Virgin in the Church of\\nthe Nuns of the Corpus Domini, showing her seated between S.\\nCatherine and S. Martha, with other female saints, two angels who\\nare sounding instruments, and a very beautiful view of buildings in\\nperspective as a background to the whole work, of which we have the\\noriginal drawings, by the hand of these men, in our book.\\n\\nAnother passing good painter in the time of these masters was\\nVincenzio Catena, who occupied himself much more with making\\nportraits from the life than with any other sort of painting; and,\\nin truth, some that are to be seen by his hand are marvellous--among\\nothers, that of a German of the Fugger family, a man of rank and\\nimportance, who was then living in the Fondaco de' Tedeschi at\\nVenice, was painted with great vivacity.\\n\\nAnother man who made many works in Venice, about the same time, was\\na disciple of Giovanni Bellini, Giovan Battista da Conigliano, by\\nwhose hand is a panel on the altar of S. Pietro Martire in the\\naforesaid Church of the Nuns of the Corpus Domini, containing the\\nsaid Saint, S. Nicholas, and S. Benedict, with landscapes in\\nperspective, an angel tuning a cithern, and many little figures more\\nthan passing good. And if this man had not died young, it may be\\nbelieved that he would have equalled his master.\\n\\nThe name of a master not otherwise than good, likewise, in the same\\nart and at the same time, was enjoyed by Marco Basarini, who,\\npainting in Venice, where he was born from a Greek father and\\nmother, executed in S. Francesco della Vigna a panel with a\\nDeposition of Christ from the Cross, and another panel in the Church\\nof S. Giobbe, representing Christ in the Garden, and below Him the\\nthree Apostles, who are sleeping, and S. Francis, S. Dominic, and\\ntwo other saints; but what was most praised in this work was a\\nlandscape with many little figures wrought with good grace. In that\\nsame church the same Marco painted S. Bernardino on a rock, with\\nother saints.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiovanetto Cordegliaghi made an infinity of devotional pictures in\\nthe same city; nay, he scarcely worked at anything else, and, in\\ntruth, he had in this sort of painting a very delicate and sweet\\nmanner, no little better than that of the aforesaid masters. In S.\\nPantaleone, in a chapel beside the principal one, this man\\npainted S. Peter making disputation with two other saints, who are\\nwearing most beautiful draperies, and are wrought with a beautiful\\nmanner.\\n\\n\\n\\nMarco Bassiti was in good repute almost at the same time, and by his\\nhand is a large panel in the Church of the Carthusian Monks at\\nVenice, in which he painted Christ between Peter and Andrew on the\\nSea of Tiberias, with the sons of Zebedee; making therein an arm of\\nthe sea, a mountain, and part of a city, with many persons in the\\nform of little figures. Many other works by this man could be\\nenumerated, but let it be enough to have spoken of this one, which\\nis the best.\\n\\nBartolommeo Vivarini of Murano also acquitted himself very well in\\nthe works that he made, as may be seen, besides many other examples,\\nin the panel that he executed for the altar of S. Luigi in the\\nChurch of SS. Giovanni e Polo; in which panel he portrayed the said\\nS. Luigi seated, wearing the cope, with S. Gregory, S. Sebastian,\\nand S. Dominic on one side of him, and on the other side S.\\nNicholas, S. Jerome, and S. Rocco, and above them half-length\\nfigures of other saints.\\n\\nAnother man who executed his pictures very well, taking much delight\\nin counterfeiting things of nature, figures, and distant landscapes,\\nwas Giovanni Mansueti, who, imitating the works of Gentile Bellini\\nnot a little, made many pictures in Venice. At the upper end of the\\nAudience Chamber of the Scuola of S. Marco he painted a S. Mark\\npreaching on the Piazza; in which picture he painted the façade of\\nthe church, and, among the multitude of men and women who are\\nlistening to the Saint, Turks, Greeks, and the faces of men of\\ndiverse nations, with bizarre costumes. In the same place, in\\nanother scene wherein he painted S. Mark healing a sick man, he made\\na perspective view of two staircases and many loggie. In another\\npicture, near to that one, he made a S. Mark converting an infinite\\nmultitude to the faith of Christ; in this he made an open temple,\\nwith a Crucifix on an altar, and throughout the whole work there are\\ndiverse persons with a beautiful variety of expression, dress, and\\nfeatures.\\n\\nThe work in the same place was continued after him by Vittore\\nBellini, who made a view of buildings in perspective, which is\\npassing good, in a scene wherein S. Mark is taken prisoner and\\nbound, with a number of figures, in which he imitated his\\npredecessors. After these men came Bartolommeo Montagna of Vicenza,\\na passing good painter, who lived ever in Venice and made many\\npictures there; and he painted a panel in the Church of S. Maria d'\\nArtone at Padua. Benedetto Diana, likewise, was a painter no less\\nesteemed than the masters mentioned above, as is proved, to say\\nnothing of his other works, by those from his hand that are in S.\\nFrancesco della Vigna at Venice, where, for the altar of S.\\nGiovanni, he painted that Saint standing between two other saints,\\neach of whom has a book in his hand.\\n\\nAnother man who was accounted a good master was Giovanni\\nBuonconsigli, who painted a picture in the Church of SS. Giovanni e\\nPolo for the altar of S. Tommaso d' Aquino, showing that Saint\\nsurrounded by many figures, to whom he is reading the Holy\\nScriptures; and he made therein a perspective view of buildings,\\nwhich is not otherwise than worthy of praise. There also lived in\\nVenice throughout almost the whole course of his life the Florentine\\nsculptor, Simon Bianco, as did Tullio Lombardo, an excellent master\\nof intaglio.\\n\\nIn Lombardy, likewise, there were excellent sculptors in Bartolommeo\\nClemente of Reggio and Agostino Busto; and, in intaglio, Jacopo\\nDavanzo of Milan, with Gasparo and Girolamo Misceroni. In Brescia\\nthere was a man who was able and masterly at working in fresco,\\ncalled Vincenzio Verchio, who acquired a very great name in his\\nnative place by reason of his beautiful works. The same did Girolamo\\nRomanino, a fine master of design, as is clearly demonstrated by the\\nworks made by him in Brescia and in the neighbourhood for many miles\\naround. And not inferior to these--nay, even superior--was\\nAlessandro Moretto, who was very delicate in his colouring, and much\\nthe friend of diligence, as the works made by him demonstrate.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut to return to Verona, in which city there have flourished\\nexcellent craftsmen, even as they flourish more than ever to-day;\\nthere, in times past, were excellent masters in Francesco Bonsignori\\nand Francesco Caroto, and afterwards Maestro Zeno of Verona, who\\npainted the panel of S. Marino in Rimini, with two others, all with\\nmuch diligence. But the man who surpassed all others in making\\ncertain marvellous figures from life was Il Moro of Verona, or\\nrather, as others called him, Francesco Turbido, by whose hand is a\\nportrait now in the house of Monsignor de' Martini at Venice, of a\\ngentleman of the house of Badovaro, painted in the character of a\\nshepherd; which portrait appears absolutely alive, and can challenge\\ncomparison with any of the great number that have been seen in these\\nparts. Battista d' Angelo, son-in-law of this Francesco, is also so\\nlovely in colouring and so masterly in drawing, that he is rather\\nsuperior than inferior to his father-in-law. But since it is not my\\nintention to speak at present of the living, it must suffice me to\\nhave spoken in this place of some with regard to whose lives, as I\\nsaid at the beginning of this Life, I have not been able to discover\\nevery particular with equal minuteness, to the end that their\\ntalents and merits may receive from me at least all that little\\nwhich I, who would fain make it much, am able to give them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJACOPO, CALLED L'INDACO\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \" OF JACOPO, CALLED L'INDACO\\n\\nPAINTER\\n\\n\\nJacopo, called L'Indaco, who was a disciple of Domenico del\\nGhirlandajo, and who worked in Rome with Pinturicchio, was a passing\\ngood master in his day; and although he did not make many works, yet\\nthose that he did make are worthy of commendation. Nor is there any\\nneed to marvel that only very few works issued from his hands, for\\nthe reason that, being a gay and humorous fellow and a lover of good\\ncheer, he harboured but few thoughts and would never work save when\\nhe could not help it; and so he used to say that doing nothing else\\nbut labour, without taking a little pleasure in the world, was no\\nlife for a Christian. He lived in close intimacy with Michelagnolo,\\nfor when that craftsman, supremely excellent beyond all who have\\never lived, wished to have some recreation after his studies and his\\ncontinuous labours of body and mind, no one was more pleasing to him\\nfor the purpose or more suited to his humour than this man.\\n\\nJacopo worked for many years in Rome, or, to be more precise, he\\nlived many years in Rome, working very little. By his hand, in that\\ncity, is the first chapel on the right hand as one enters the Church\\nof S. Agostino by the door of the façade; on the vaulting of which\\nchapel are the Apostles receiving the Holy Spirit, and on the wall\\nbelow are two stories of Christ--in one His taking Peter and Andrew\\nfrom their nets, and in the other the Feast of Simon and the\\nMagdalene, in which there is a ceiling of planks and beams,\\ncounterfeited very well. In the panel of the same chapel, which he\\npainted in oil, is a Dead Christ, wrought and executed with much\\nmastery and diligence. In the Trinità at Rome, likewise, there is a\\nlittle panel by his hand with the Coronation of Our Lady. But what\\nneed is there to say more about this man? What more, indeed, is\\nthere to say? It is enough that he loved gossiping as much as he\\nalways hated working and painting.\\n\\nNow seeing that, as has been said, Michelagnolo used to take\\npleasure in this man's chattering and in the jokes that he was ever\\nmaking, he kept him almost always at his table; but one day Jacopo\\nwearied him--as such fellows more often than not do come to weary\\ntheir friends and patrons with their incessant babbling, so often\\nill-timed and senseless; babbling, I call it, for reasonable talk it\\ncannot be called, since for the most part there is neither reason\\nnor judgment in such people--and Michelagnolo, who, perchance, had\\nother thoughts in his mind at the time and wished to get rid of him,\\nsent him to buy some figs; and no sooner had Jacopo left the house\\nthan Michelagnolo bolted the door behind him, determined not to open\\nto him when he came back. L'Indaco, then, on returning from the\\nmarket-square, perceived, after having knocked at the door for a\\ntime in vain, that Michelagnolo did not intend to open to him;\\nwhereupon, flying into a rage, he took the figs and the leaves and\\nspread them all over the threshold of the door. This done, he went\\nhis way and for many months refused to speak to Michelagnolo; but at\\nlast, becoming reconciled with him, he was more his friend than\\never. Finally, having reached the age of sixty-eight, he died in\\nRome.\\n\\nNot unlike Jacopo was a younger brother of his, whose proper name\\nwas Francesco, although he too was afterwards called L'Indaco by way\\nof surname; and he, likewise, was a painter, and more than passing\\ngood. He was not unlike Jacopo--I mean, in his unwillingness to work\\n(to say the least), and in his love of talking--but in one respect\\nhe surpassed Jacopo, for he was ever speaking evil of everyone and\\ndecrying the works of every craftsman. This man, after having\\nwrought certain things in Montepulciano both in painting and in\\nclay, painted a little panel for the Audience Chamber of the Company\\nof the Nunziata in Arezzo, containing an Annunciation, and a God the\\nFather in Heaven surrounded by many angels in the form of children.\\nAnd in the same city, on the first occasion when Duke Alessandro\\nwent there, he made a most beautiful triumphal arch, with many\\nfigures in relief, at the gate of the Palazzo de' Signori; and also,\\nin competition with other painters who executed a number of other\\nworks for the entry of the said Duke, the scenery for the\\nrepresentation of a play, which was held to be very beautiful.\\nAfterwards, having gone to Rome at the time when the Emperor Charles\\nV was expected there, he made some figures in clay, and a coat of\\narms in fresco for the Roman people on the Campidoglio, which was\\nmuch extolled. But the best work that ever issued from the hands of\\nthis master, and the most highly praised, was a little study wrought\\nin stucco for the Duchess Margherita of Austria in the Palace of the\\nMedici at Rome--a thing so beautiful and so ornate that there is\\nnothing better to be seen; nor do I believe that it is possible, in\\na certain sense, to do with silver what L'Indaco did in this work\\nwith stucco. From these things it may be judged that if this man had\\ntaken pleasure in work and had made use of his intelligence, he\\nwould have become excellent.\\n\\nFrancesco drew passing well, but Jacopo much better, as may be seen\\nin our book.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLUCA SIGNORELLI OF CORTONA\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " ' OF LUCA SIGNORELLI OF CORTONA\\n\\n[_LUCA DA CORTONA_]\\n\\nPAINTER\\n\\n\\nLuca Signorelli, an excellent painter, of whom, according to the\\norder of time, we have now to speak, was more famous throughout\\nItaly in his day, and his works were held in greater price than has\\never been the case with any other master at any time whatsoever, for\\nthe reason that in the works that he executed in painting he showed\\nthe true method of making nudes, and how they can be caused,\\nalthough only with art and difficulty, to appear alive. He was a\\npupil and disciple of Piero dal Borgo a San Sepolcro, and greatly\\ndid he strive in his youth to imitate his master, and even to\\nsurpass him; and the while that he was working with Piero at Arezzo,\\nliving in the house of his uncle Lazzaro Vasari, as it has been\\ntold, he imitated the manner of the said Piero so well that the one\\ncould scarcely be distinguished from the other.\\n\\nThe first works of Luca were in S. Lorenzo at Arezzo, where he\\npainted the Chapel of S. Barbara in fresco in the year 1472; and he\\npainted for the Company of S. Caterina, on cloth and in oil, the\\nbanner that is borne in processions, and likewise that of the\\nTrinità, although this does not appear to be by the hand of Luca,\\nbut by Piero dal Borgo himself. In S. Agostino in the same city he\\npainted the panel of S. Niccola da Tolentino, with most beautiful\\nlittle scenes, executing the work with good drawing and invention;\\nand in the same place, in the Chapel of the Sacrament, he made two\\nangels wrought in fresco. In the Chapel of the Accolti in the Church\\nof S. Francesco, for Messer Francesco, Doctor of Laws, he painted a\\npanel in which he portrayed the said Messer Francesco with some of\\nhis relatives. In this work is a S. Michael weighing souls, who is\\nadmirable; and in him there is seen the knowledge of Luca, both in\\nthe splendour of his armour and in the reflected lights, and, in\\nshort, throughout the whole work. In his hands he placed a pair of\\nscales, in which are nude figures, very beautifully foreshortened,\\none going up and the other down; and among other ingenious things\\nthat are in this picture is a nude figure most skilfully transformed\\ninto a devil, with a lizard licking the blood from a wound in its\\nbody. Besides this, there is a Madonna with the Child on her lap,\\nwith S. Stephen, S. Laurence, S. Catherine, and two angels, of whom\\none is playing on a lute and the other on a rebec; and all these\\nfigures are draped and adorned so beautifully that it is a marvel.\\nBut the most miraculous part of this panel is the predella, which is\\nfull of Friars of the said S. Catherine in the form of little\\nfigures.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn Perugia, also, he made many works; among others, a panel in the\\nDuomo for Messer Jacopo Vannucci of Cortona, Bishop of that city; in\\nwhich panel are Our Lady, S. Onofrio, S. Ercolano, S. John the\\nBaptist, and S. Stephen, with a most beautiful angel, who is tuning\\na lute. At Volterra, over the altar of a Company in the Church of S.\\nFrancesco, he painted in fresco the Circumcision of Our Lord, which\\nis considered beautiful to a marvel, although the Infant, having\\nbeen injured by damp, was restored by Sodoma and made much less\\nbeautiful than before. And, in truth, it would be sometimes better\\nto leave works half spoilt, when they have been made by men of\\nexcellence, rather than to have them retouched by inferior masters.\\nIn S. Agostino in the same city he painted a panel in distemper, and\\nthe predella of little figures, with stories of the Passion of\\nChrist; and this is held to be extraordinarily beautiful. At S.\\nMaria a Monte he painted a Dead Christ on a panel for the monks of\\nthat place; and at Città di Castello a Nativity of Christ in S.\\nFrancesco, with a S. Sebastian on another panel in S. Domenico. In\\nS. Margherita, a seat of the Frati del Zoccolo in his native city of\\nCortona, he painted a Dead Christ, one of the rarest of his works;\\nand for the Company of the Gesù, in the same city, he executed three\\npanels, of which the one that is on the high-altar is marvellous,\\nshowing Christ administering the Sacrament to the Apostles, and\\nJudas placing the Host into his wallet. In the Pieve, now called\\nthe Vescovado, in the Chapel of the Sacrament, he painted some\\nlife-size prophets in fresco; and round the tabernacle are some\\nangels who are opening out a canopy, with S. Jerome and S. Thomas\\nAquinas at the sides. For the high-altar of the said church he\\npainted a panel with a most beautiful Assumption, and he designed\\nthe pictures for the principal round window of the same church;\\nwhich pictures were afterwards executed by Stagio Sassoli of Arezzo.\\nIn Castiglione Aretino he made a Dead Christ, with the Maries, over\\nthe Chapel of the Sacrament; and in S. Francesco, at Lucignano, he\\npainted the folding-doors of a press, wherein there is a tree of\\ncoral surmounted by a cross. At Siena, in the Chapel of S.\\nCristofano in S. Agostino, he painted a panel with some saints, in\\nthe midst of whom is a S. Cristopher in relief.\\n\\nHaving gone from Siena to Florence in order to see both the works of\\nthose masters who were then living and those of many already dead,\\nhe painted for Lorenzo de\\' Medici certain nude gods on a canvas, for\\nwhich he was much commended, and a picture of Our Lady with two\\nlittle prophets in terretta, which is now at Castello, a villa of\\nDuke Cosimo\\'s. These works, both the one and the other, he presented\\nto the said Lorenzo, who would never be beaten by any man in\\nliberality and magnificence. He also painted a round picture of Our\\nLady, which is in the Audience Chamber of the Captains of the Guelph\\nparty--a very beautiful work. At Chiusuri in the district of Siena,\\nthe principal seat of the Monks of Monte Oliveto, he painted eleven\\nscenes of the life and acts of S. Benedict on one side of the\\ncloister. And from Cortona he sent some of his works to\\nMontepulciano; to Foiano the panel which is on the high-altar of the\\nPieve; and other works to other places in Valdichiana. In the\\nMadonna, the principal church of Orvieto, he finished with his own\\nhand the chapel that Fra Giovanni da Fiesole had formerly begun\\nthere; in which chapel he painted all the scenes of the end of the\\nworld with bizarre and fantastic invention--angels, demons, ruins,\\nearthquakes, fires, miracles of Antichrist, and many other similar\\nthings besides, such as nudes, foreshortenings, and many beautiful\\nfigures; imagining the terror that there shall be on that last and\\nawful day. By means of this he encouraged all those who have lived\\nafter him, insomuch that since then they have found easy the\\ndifficulties of that manner; wherefore I do not marvel that the\\nworks of Luca were ever very highly extolled by Michelagnolo, nor\\nthat in certain parts of his divine Judgment, which he made in the\\nchapel, he should have deigned to avail himself in some measure of\\nthe inventions of Luca, as he did in the angels, the demons, the\\ndivision of the Heavens, and other things, in which Michelagnolo\\nhimself imitated Luca\\'s method, as all may see. In this work Luca\\nportrayed himself and many of his friends; Niccolò, Paolo, and\\nVitelozzo Vitelli, Giovan Paolo and Orazio Baglioni, and others\\nwhose names are not known. In the Sacristy of S. Maria at Loreto he\\npainted in fresco the four Evangelists, the four Doctors, and other\\nsaints, all very beautiful; and for this work he was liberally\\nrewarded by Pope Sixtus.\\n\\nIt is said that a son of his, most beautiful in countenance and in\\nperson, whom he loved dearly, was killed at Cortona; and that Luca,\\nheart-broken as he was, had him stripped naked, and with the\\ngreatest firmness of soul, without lamenting or shedding a tear,\\nportrayed him, to the end that, whenever he might wish, he might be\\nable by means of the work of his own hands to see that which nature\\nhad given him and adverse fortune had snatched away.\\n\\nBeing then summoned by the said Pope Sixtus to work in the chapel of\\nhis Palace in competition with many other painters, he painted\\ntherein two scenes, which are held the best among so many; one is\\nMoses declaring his testament to the Jewish people on having seen\\nthe Promised Land, and the other is his death.\\n\\n\\n\\nFinally, having executed works for almost every Prince in Italy, and\\nbeing now old, he returned to Cortona, where, in those last years of\\nhis life, he worked more for pleasure than for any other reason, as\\none who, being used to labour, neither could nor would stay idle. In\\nthis his old age, then, he painted a panel for the Nuns of S.\\nMargherita at Arezzo, and one for the Company of S. Girolamo, which\\nwas paid for in part by Messer Niccolò Gamurrini, Doctor of Laws and\\nAuditor of the Ruota, who is portrayed from life in that\\npanel, kneeling before the Madonna, to whom he is being presented by\\na S. Nicholas who is in the same panel; there are also S. Donatus\\nand S. Stephen, and lower down a nude S. Jerome, and a David who is\\nsinging to a psaltery; and also two prophets, who, as it appears\\nfrom the scrolls that they have in their hands, are speaking about\\nthe Conception. This work was brought from Cortona to Arezzo on the\\nshoulders of the men of that Company; and Luca, old as he was,\\ninsisted on coming to set it in place, and partly also in order to\\nrevisit his friends and relatives. And since he lodged in the house\\nof the Vasari, in which I then was, a little boy of eight years old,\\nI remember that the good old man, who was most gracious and\\ncourteous, having heard from the master who was teaching me my first\\nletters, that I gave my attention to nothing in lesson-time save to\\ndrawing figures, I remember, I say, that he turned to my father\\nAntonio and said to him: \"Antonio, if you wish little Giorgio not to\\nbecome backward, by all means let him learn to draw, for, even were\\nhe to devote himself to letters, design cannot be otherwise than\\nhelpful, honourable, and advantageous to him, as it is to every\\ngentleman.\" Then, turning to me, who was standing in front of him,\\nhe said: \"Mind your lessons, little kinsman.\" He said many other\\nthings about me, which I withhold, for the reason that I know that I\\nhave failed by a great measure to justify the opinion which the good\\nold man had of me. And since he heard, as was true, that the blood\\nused to flow from my nose at that age in such quantities that this\\nleft me sometimes half dead, with infinite lovingness he bound a\\njasper round my neck with his own hand; and this memory of Luca will\\nstay for ever fixed in my mind. The said panel set in place, he\\nreturned to Cortona, accompanied for a great part of the way by many\\ncitizens, friends, and relatives, as was due to the excellence of\\nLuca, who always lived rather as a noble and a man of rank than as a\\npainter.\\n\\nAbout the same time a palace had been built for Cardinal Silvio\\nPasserini of Cortona, half a mile beyond the city, by Benedetto\\nCaporali, a painter of Perugia, who, delighting in architecture, had\\nwritten a commentary on Vitruvius a short time before; and the said\\nCardinal determined to have almost the whole of it painted.\\nWherefore Benedetto, putting his hand to this with the aid of Maso\\nPapacello of Cortona (who was his disciple and had also learnt not a\\nlittle from Giulio Romano, as will be told), of Tommaso, and of\\nother disciples and lads, did not cease until he had painted it\\nalmost all over in fresco. But the Cardinal wishing to have some\\npainting by the hand of Luca as well, he, old as he was, and\\nhindered by palsy, painted in fresco, on the altar-wall of the\\nchapel of that palace, the scene of S. John the Baptist baptizing\\nthe Saviour; but he was not able to finish it completely, for while\\nstill working at it he died, having reached the age of eighty-two.\\n\\nLuca was a man of most excellent character, true and loving with his\\nfriends, sweet and amiable in his dealings with every man, and,\\nabove all, courteous to all who had need of him, and kindly in\\nteaching his disciples. He lived splendidly, and he took delight in\\nclothing himself well. And for these good qualities he was ever held\\nin the highest veneration both in his own country and abroad.\\n\\nAnd so, with the end of this master\\'s life, which was in 1521, we\\nwill bring to an end the Second Part of these Lives; concluding with\\nLuca, as the man who, with his profound mastery of design,\\nparticularly in nudes, and with his grace in invention and in the\\ncomposition of scenes, opened to the majority of craftsmen the way\\nto the final perfection of art, to which those men who followed were\\nafterwards enabled to add the crown, of whom we are henceforward to\\nspeak.\\n\\n\\n     THE THIRD PART OF THE ',\n",
       " ' OF THE SCULPTORS, PAINTERS, AND\\n     ARCHITECTS, WHO HAVE LIVED FROM CIMABUE TO OUR OWN DAY. WRITTEN\\n     BY MESSER GIORGIO VASARI, PAINTER AND ARCHITECT OF AREZZO\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPREFACE TO THE THIRD PART\\n\\n\\nTruly great was the advancement conferred on the arts of\\narchitecture, painting, and sculpture by those excellent masters of\\nwhom we have written hitherto, in the Second Part of these Lives,\\nfor to the achievements of the early masters they added rule, order,\\nproportion, draughtsmanship, and manner; not, indeed, in complete\\nperfection, but with so near an approach to the truth that the\\nmasters of the third age, of whom we are henceforward to speak, were\\nenabled, by means of their light, to aspire still higher and attain\\nto that supreme perfection which we see in the most highly prized\\nand most celebrated of our modern works. But to the end that the\\nnature of the improvement brought about by the aforesaid craftsmen\\nmay be even more clearly understood, it will certainly not be out of\\nplace to explain in a few words the five additions that I have\\nnamed, and to give a succinct account of the origin of that true\\nexcellence which, having surpassed the age of the ancients, makes\\nthe modern so glorious.\\n\\nRule, then, in architecture, was the process of taking measurements\\nfrom antiquities and studying the ground-plans of ancient edifices\\nfor the construction of modern buildings. Order was the separating\\nof one style from another, so that each body should receive its\\nproper members, with no more interchanging between Doric, Ionic,\\nCorinthian, and Tuscan. Proportion was the universal law applying\\nboth to architecture and to sculpture, that all bodies should be\\nmade correct and true, with the members in proper harmony; and so,\\nalso, in painting. Draughtsmanship was the imitation of the most\\nbeautiful parts of nature in all figures, whether in sculpture or in\\npainting; and for this it is necessary to have a hand and a brain\\nable to reproduce with absolute accuracy and precision, on a level\\nsurface--whether by drawing on paper, or on panel, or on some other\\nlevel surface--everything that the eye sees; and the same is true of\\nrelief in sculpture. Manner then attained to the greatest beauty\\nfrom the practice which arose of constantly copying the most\\nbeautiful objects, and joining together these most beautiful things,\\nhands, heads, bodies, and legs, so as to make a figure of the\\ngreatest possible beauty. This practice was carried out in every\\nwork for all figures, and for that reason it is called the beautiful\\nmanner.\\n\\nThese things had not been done by Giotto or by the other early\\ncraftsmen, although they had discovered the rudiments of all these\\ndifficulties, and had touched them on the surface; as in their\\ndrawing, which was sounder and more true to nature than it had been\\nbefore, and likewise in harmony of colouring and in the grouping of\\nfigures in scenes, and in many other respects of which enough has\\nbeen said. Now although the masters of the second age improved our\\narts greatly with regard to all the qualities mentioned above, yet\\nthese were not made by them so perfect as to succeed in attaining to\\ncomplete perfection, for there was wanting in their rule a certain\\nfreedom which, without being of the rule, might be directed by the\\nrule and might be able to exist without causing confusion or\\nspoiling the order; which order had need of an invention abundant in\\nevery respect, and of a certain beauty maintained in every least\\ndetail, so as to reveal all that order with more adornment. In\\nproportion there was wanting a certain correctness of judgment, by\\nmeans of which their figures, without having been measured, might\\nhave, in due relation to their dimensions, a grace exceeding\\nmeasurement. In their drawing there was not the perfection of\\nfinish, because, although they made an arm round and a leg straight,\\nthe muscles in these were not revealed with that sweet and facile\\ngrace which hovers midway between the seen and the unseen, as is the\\ncase with the flesh of living figures; nay, they were crude and\\nexcoriated, which made them displeasing to the eye and gave hardness\\nto the manner. This last was wanting in the delicacy that comes from\\nmaking all figures light and graceful, particularly those of women\\nand children, with the limbs true to nature, as in the case of men,\\nbut veiled with a plumpness and fleshiness that should not be\\nawkward, as they are in nature, but refined by draughtsmanship and\\njudgment. They also lacked our abundance of beautiful costumes, our\\ngreat number and variety of bizarre fancies, loveliness of\\ncolouring, wide knowledge of buildings, and distance and variety in\\nlandscapes. And although many of them, such as Andrea Verrocchio and\\nAntonio del Pollaiuolo, and many others more modern, began to seek\\nto make their figures with more study, so as to reveal in them\\nbetter draughtsmanship, with a degree of imitation more correct and\\ntruer to nature, nevertheless the whole was not yet there, even\\nthough they had one very certain assurance--namely, that they were\\nadvancing towards the good, and their figures were thus approved\\naccording to the standard of the works of the ancients, as was seen\\nwhen Andrea Verrocchio restored in marble the legs and arms of the\\nMarsyas in the house of the Medici in Florence. But they lacked a\\ncertain finish and finality of perfection in the feet, hands, hair,\\nand beards, although the limbs as a whole are in accordance with the\\nantique and have a certain correct harmony in the proportions. Now\\nif they had had that minuteness of finish which is the perfection\\nand bloom of art, they would also have had a resolute boldness in\\ntheir works; and from this there would have followed delicacy,\\nrefinement, and supreme grace, which are the qualities produced by\\nthe perfection of art in beautiful figures, whether in relief or in\\npainting; but these qualities they did not have, although they give\\nproof of diligent striving. That finish, and that certain something\\nthat they lacked, they could not achieve so readily, seeing that\\nstudy, when it is used in that way to obtain finish, gives dryness\\nto the manner.\\n\\nAfter them, indeed, their successors were enabled to attain to it\\nthrough seeing excavated out of the earth certain antiquities cited\\nby Pliny as amongst the most famous, such as the Laocoon, the\\nHercules, the Great Torso of the Belvedere, and likewise the Venus,\\nthe Cleopatra, the Apollo, and an endless number of others, which,\\nboth with their sweetness and their severity, with their fleshy\\nroundness copied from the greatest beauties of nature, and with\\ncertain attitudes which involve no distortion of the whole figure\\nbut only a movement of certain parts, and are revealed with a most\\nperfect grace, brought about the disappearance of a certain dryness,\\nhardness, and sharpness of manner, which had been left to our art by\\nthe excessive study of Piero della Francesca, Lazzaro Vasari, Alesso\\nBaldovinetti, Andrea dal Castagno, Pesello, Ercole Ferrarese,\\nGiovanni Bellini, Cosimo Rosselli, the Abbot of S. Clemente,\\nDomenico del Ghirlandajo, Sandro Botticelli, Andrea Mantegna,\\nFilippo, and Luca Signorelli. These masters sought with great\\nefforts to do the impossible in art by means of labour, particularly\\nin foreshortenings and in things unpleasant to the eye, which were\\nas painful to see as they were difficult for them to execute. And\\nalthough their works were for the most part well drawn and free from\\nerrors, yet there was wanting a certain resolute spirit which was\\nnever seen in them, and that sweet harmony of colouring which the\\nBolognese Francia and Pietro Perugino first began to show in their\\nworks; at the sight of which people ran like madmen to this new and\\nmore lifelike beauty, for it seemed to them quite certain that\\nnothing better could ever be done. But their error was afterwards\\nclearly proved by the works of Leonardo da Vinci, who, giving a\\nbeginning to that third manner which we propose to call the\\nmodern--besides the force and boldness of his drawing, and the\\nextreme subtlety wherewith he counterfeited all the minutenesses of\\nnature exactly as they are--with good rule, better order, right\\nproportion, perfect drawing, and divine grace, abounding in\\nresources and having a most profound knowledge of art, may be truly\\nsaid to have endowed his figures with motion and breath.\\n\\nThere followed after him, although at some distance, Giorgione da\\nCastelfranco, who obtained a beautiful gradation of colour in his\\npictures, and gave a sublime movement to his works by means of a\\ncertain darkness of shadow, very well conceived; and not inferior to\\nhim in giving force, relief, sweetness, and grace to his pictures,\\nwith his colouring, was Fra Bartolommeo di San Marco. But more than\\nall did the most gracious Raffaello da Urbino, who, studying the\\nlabours of the old masters and those of the modern, took the best\\nfrom them, and, having gathered it together, enriched the art of\\npainting with that complete perfection which was shown in ancient\\ntimes by the figures of Apelles and Zeuxis; nay, even more, if we\\nmay make bold to say it, as might be proved if we could compare\\ntheir works with his. Wherefore nature was left vanquished by his\\ncolours; and his invention was facile and peculiar to himself, as\\nmay be perceived by all who see his painted stories, which are as\\nvivid as writings, for in them he showed us places and buildings\\ntrue to reality, and the features and costumes both of our own\\npeople and of strangers, according to his pleasure; not to mention\\nhis gift of imparting grace to the heads of young men, old men, and\\nwomen, reserving modesty for the modest, wantonness for the wanton,\\nand for children now mischief in their eyes, now playfulness in\\ntheir attitudes; and the folds of his draperies, also, are neither\\ntoo simple nor too intricate, but of such a kind that they appear\\nreal.\\n\\nIn the same manner, but sweeter in colouring and not so bold, there\\nfollowed Andrea del Sarto, who may be called a rare painter, for his\\nworks are free from errors. Nor is it possible to describe the\\ncharming vivacity seen in the works of Antonio da Correggio, who\\npainted hair in detail, not in the precise manner used by the\\nmasters before him, which was constrained, sharp, and dry, but soft\\nand feathery, with each single hair visible, such was his facility\\nin making them; and they seemed like gold and more beautiful than\\nreal hair, which is surpassed by that which he painted.\\n\\nThe same did Francesco Mazzuoli of Parma, who excelled him in many\\nrespects in grace, adornment, and beauty of manner, as may be seen\\nin many of his pictures, which smile on whoever beholds them; and\\neven as there is a perfect illusion of sight in the eyes, so there\\nis perceived the beating of the pulse, according as it best pleased\\nhis brush. But whosoever shall consider the mural paintings of\\nPolidoro and Maturino, will see figures in attitudes that seem\\nbeyond the bounds of possibility, and he will wonder with amazement\\nhow it can be possible, not to describe with the tongue, which is\\neasy, but to express with the brush the tremendous conceptions which\\nthey put into execution with such mastery and dexterity, in\\nrepresenting the deeds of the Romans exactly as they were.\\n\\nAnd how many there are who, having given life to their figures with\\ntheir colours, are now dead, such as Il Rosso, Fra Sebastiano,\\nGiulio Romano, and Perino del Vaga! For of the living, who are known\\nto all through their own efforts, there is no need to speak here.\\nBut what most concerns the whole world of art is that they have now\\nbrought it to such perfection, and made it so easy for him who\\npossesses draughtsmanship, invention, and colouring, that, whereas\\nthose early masters took six years to paint one panel, our modern\\nmasters can paint six in one year, as I can testify with the\\ngreatest confidence both from seeing and from doing; and our\\npictures are clearly much more highly finished and perfect than\\nthose executed in former times by masters of account.\\n\\nBut he who bears the palm from both the living and the dead,\\ntranscending and eclipsing all others, is the divine Michelagnolo\\nBuonarroti, who holds the sovereignty not merely of one of these\\narts, but of all three together. This master surpasses and excels\\nnot only all those moderns who have almost vanquished nature, but\\neven those most famous ancients who without a doubt did so\\ngloriously surpass her; and in his own self he triumphs over\\nmoderns, ancients, and nature, who could scarcely conceive anything\\nso strange and so difficult that he would not be able, by the force\\nof his most divine intellect and by means of his industry,\\ndraughtsmanship, art, judgment, and grace, to excel it by a great\\nmeasure; and that not only in painting and in the use of colour,\\nunder which title are comprised all forms, and all bodies upright or\\nnot upright, palpable or impalpable, visible or invisible, but also\\nin the highest perfection of bodies in the round, with the point of\\nhis chisel. And from a plant so beautiful and so fruitful, through\\nhis labours, there have already spread branches so many and so\\nnoble, that, besides having filled the world in such unwonted\\nprofusion with the most luscious fruits, they have also given the\\nfinal form to these three most noble arts. And so great and so\\nmarvellous is his perfection, that it may be safely and surely said\\nthat his statues are in all their parts much more beautiful than the\\nancient; for if we compare the heads, hands, arms, and feet shaped\\nby the one with those of the others, we see in his a greater depth\\nand solidity, a grace more completely graceful, and a much more\\nabsolute perfection, accomplished with a manner so facile in the\\novercoming of difficulties, that it is not possible ever to see\\nanything better. And the same may be believed of his pictures,\\nwhich; if we chanced to have some by the most famous Greeks and\\nRomans, so that we might compare them face to face, would prove to\\nbe as much higher in value and more noble as his sculptures are\\nclearly superior to all those of the ancients.\\n\\nBut if we admire so greatly those most famous masters who, spurred\\nby such extraordinary rewards and by such good-fortune, gave life to\\ntheir works, how much more should we not celebrate and exalt to the\\nheavens those rare intellects who, not only without reward, but in\\nmiserable poverty, bring forth fruits so precious? We must believe\\nand declare, then, that if, in this our age, there were a due meed\\nof remuneration, there would be without a doubt works greater and\\nmuch better than were ever wrought by the ancients. But the fact\\nthat they have to grapple more with famine than with fame, keeps our\\nhapless intellects submerged, and, to the shame and disgrace of\\nthose who could raise them up but give no thought to it, prevents\\nthem from becoming known.\\n\\nAnd let this be enough to have said on this subject; for it is now\\ntime to return to the Lives, and to treat in detail of all those who\\nhave executed famous works in this third manner, the creator of\\nwhich was Leonardo da Vinci, with whom we will now begin.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLEONARDO DA VINCI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " ' OF LEONARDO DA VINCI\\n\\nPAINTER AND SCULPTOR OF FLORENCE\\n\\n\\nThe greatest gifts are often seen, in the course of nature, rained\\nby celestial influences on human creatures; and sometimes, in\\nsupernatural fashion, beauty, grace, and talent are united beyond\\nmeasure in one single person, in a manner that to whatever such an\\none turns his attention, his every action is so divine, that,\\nsurpassing all other men, it makes itself clearly known as a thing\\nbestowed by God (as it is), and not acquired by human art. This was\\nseen by all mankind in Leonardo da Vinci, in whom, besides a beauty\\nof body never sufficiently extolled, there was an infinite grace in\\nall his actions; and so great was his genius, and such its growth,\\nthat to whatever difficulties he turned his mind, he solved them\\nwith ease. In him was great bodily strength, joined to dexterity,\\nwith a spirit and courage ever royal and magnanimous; and the fame\\nof his name so increased, that not only in his lifetime was he held\\nin esteem, but his reputation became even greater among posterity\\nafter his death.\\n\\nTruly marvellous and celestial was Leonardo, the son of Ser Piero da\\nVinci; and in learning and in the rudiments of letters he would have\\nmade great proficience, if he had not been so variable and unstable,\\nfor he set himself to learn many things, and then, after having\\nbegun them, abandoned them. Thus, in arithmetic, during the few\\nmonths that he studied it, he made so much progress, that, by\\ncontinually suggesting doubts and difficulties to the master who\\nwas teaching him, he would very often bewilder him. He gave some\\nlittle attention to music, and quickly resolved to learn to play the\\nlyre, as one who had by nature a spirit most lofty and full of\\nrefinement: wherefore he sang divinely to that instrument,\\nimprovising upon it. Nevertheless, although he occupied himself with\\nsuch a variety of things, he never ceased drawing and working in\\nrelief, pursuits which suited his fancy more than any other. Ser\\nPiero, having observed this, and having considered the loftiness of\\nhis intellect, one day took some of his drawings and carried them to\\nAndrea del Verrocchio, who was much his friend, and besought him\\nstraitly to tell him whether Leonardo, by devoting himself to\\ndrawing, would make any proficience. Andrea was astonished to see\\nthe extraordinary beginnings of Leonardo, and urged Ser Piero that\\nhe should make him study it; wherefore he arranged with Leonardo\\nthat he should enter the workshop of Andrea, which Leonardo did with\\nthe greatest willingness in the world. And he practised not one\\nbranch of art only, but all those in which drawing played a part;\\nand having an intellect so divine and marvellous that he was also an\\nexcellent geometrician, he not only worked in sculpture, making in\\nhis youth, in clay, some heads of women that are smiling, of which\\nplaster casts are still taken, and likewise some heads of boys which\\nappeared to have issued from the hand of a master; but in\\narchitecture, also, he made many drawings both of ground-plans and\\nof other designs of buildings; and he was the first, although but a\\nyouth, who suggested the plan of reducing the river Arno to a\\nnavigable canal from Pisa to Florence. He made designs of\\nflour-mills, fulling-mills, and engines, which might be driven by\\nthe force of water: and since he wished that his profession should\\nbe painting, he studied much in drawing after nature, and sometimes\\nin making models of figures in clay, over which he would lay soft\\npieces of cloth dipped in clay, and then set himself patiently to\\ndraw them on a certain kind of very fine Rheims cloth, or prepared\\nlinen: and he executed them in black and white with the point of his\\nbrush, so that it was a marvel, as some of them by his hand, which I\\nhave in our book of drawings, still bear witness; besides which, he\\ndrew on paper with such diligence and so well, that there is no one\\nwho has ever equalled him in perfection of finish; and I have one, a\\nhead drawn with the style in chiaroscuro, which is divine.\\n\\nAnd there was infused in that brain such grace from God, and a power\\nof expression in such sublime accord with the intellect and memory\\nthat served it, and he knew so well how to express his conceptions\\nby draughtsmanship, that he vanquished with his discourse, and\\nconfuted with his reasoning, every valiant wit. And he was\\ncontinually making models and designs to show men how to remove\\nmountains with ease, and how to bore them in order to pass from one\\nlevel to another; and by means of levers, windlasses, and screws, he\\nshowed the way to raise and draw great weights, together with\\nmethods for emptying harbours, and pumps for removing water from low\\nplaces, things which his brain never ceased from devising; and of\\nthese ideas and labours many drawings may be seen, scattered abroad\\namong our craftsmen; and I myself have seen not a few. He even went\\nso far as to waste his time in drawing knots of cords, made\\naccording to an order, that from one end all the rest might follow\\ntill the other, so as to fill a round; and one of these is to be\\nseen in stamp, most difficult and beautiful, and in the middle of it\\nare these words, \"Leonardus Vinci Accademia.\" And among these models\\nand designs, there was one by which he often demonstrated to many\\ningenious citizens, who were then governing Florence, how he\\nproposed to raise the Temple of S. Giovanni in Florence, and place\\nsteps under it, without damaging the building; and with such strong\\nreasons did he urge this, that it appeared possible, although each\\nman, after he had departed, would recognize for himself the\\nimpossibility of so vast an undertaking.\\n\\nHe was so pleasing in conversation, that he attracted to himself the\\nhearts of men. And although he possessed, one might say, nothing,\\nand worked little, he always kept servants and horses, in which\\nlatter he took much delight, and particularly in all other animals,\\nwhich he managed with the greatest love and patience; and this he\\nshowed when often passing by the places where birds were sold, for,\\ntaking them with his own hand out of their cages, and having paid to\\nthose who sold them the price that was asked, he let them fly away\\ninto the air, restoring to them their lost liberty. For which\\nreason nature was pleased so to favour him, that, wherever he turned\\nhis thought, brain, and mind, he displayed such divine power in his\\nworks, that, in giving them their perfection, no one was ever his\\npeer in readiness, vivacity, excellence, beauty, and grace.\\n\\nIt is clear that Leonardo, through his comprehension of art, began\\nmany things and never finished one of them, since it seemed to him\\nthat the hand was not able to attain to the perfection of art in\\ncarrying out the things which he imagined; for the reason that he\\nconceived in idea difficulties so subtle and so marvellous, that\\nthey could never be expressed by the hands, be they ever so\\nexcellent. And so many were his caprices, that, philosophizing of\\nnatural things, he set himself to seek out the properties of herbs,\\ngoing on even to observe the motions of the heavens, the path of the\\nmoon, and the courses of the sun.\\n\\nHe was placed, then, as has been said, in his boyhood, at the\\ninstance of Ser Piero, to learn art with Andrea del Verrocchio, who\\nwas making a panel-picture of S. John baptizing Christ, when\\nLeonardo painted an angel who was holding some garments; and\\nalthough he was but a lad, Leonardo executed it in such a manner\\nthat his angel was much better than the figures of Andrea; which was\\nthe reason that Andrea would never again touch colour, in disdain\\nthat a child should know more than he.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe was commissioned to make a cartoon for a door-hanging that was to\\nbe executed in Flanders, woven in gold and silk, to be sent to the\\nKing of Portugal, of Adam and Eve sinning in the Earthly Paradise;\\nwherein Leonardo drew with the brush in chiaroscuro, with the lights\\nin lead-white, a meadow of infinite kinds of herbage, with some\\nanimals, of which, in truth, it may be said that for diligence and\\ntruth to nature divine wit could not make it so perfect. In it is\\nthe fig-tree, together with the foreshortening of the leaves and the\\nvarying aspects of the branches, wrought with such lovingness that\\nthe brain reels at the mere thought how a man could have such\\npatience. There is also a palm-tree which has the radiating crown of\\nthe palm, executed with such great and marvellous art that nothing\\nsave the patience and intellect of Leonardo could avail to do it.\\nThis work was carried no farther; wherefore the cartoon is now at\\nFlorence, in the blessed house of the Magnificent Ottaviano de\\'\\nMedici, presented to him not long ago by the uncle of Leonardo.\\n\\nIt is said that Ser Piero da Vinci, being at his villa, was besought\\nas a favour, by a peasant of his, who had made a buckler with his\\nown hands out of a fig-tree that he had cut down on the farm, to\\nhave it painted for him in Florence, which he did very willingly,\\nsince the countryman was very skilful at catching birds and fishing,\\nand Ser Piero made much use of him in these pursuits. Thereupon,\\nhaving had it taken to Florence, without saying a word to Leonardo\\nas to whose it was, he asked him to paint something upon it.\\nLeonardo, having one day taken this buckler in his hands, and seeing\\nit twisted, badly made, and clumsy, straightened it by the fire,\\nand, having given it to a turner, from the rude and clumsy thing\\nthat it was, caused it to be made smooth and even. And afterwards,\\nhaving given it a coat of gesso, and having prepared it in his own\\nway, he began to think what he could paint upon it, that might be\\nable to terrify all who should come upon it, producing the same\\neffect as once did the head of Medusa. For this purpose, then,\\nLeonardo carried to a room of his own into which no one entered save\\nhimself alone, lizards great and small, crickets, serpents,\\nbutterflies, grasshoppers, bats, and other strange kinds of suchlike\\nanimals, out of the number of which, variously put together, he\\nformed a great ugly creature, most horrible and terrifying, which\\nemitted a poisonous breath and turned the air to flame; and he made\\nit coming out of a dark and jagged rock, belching forth venom from\\nits open throat, fire from its eyes, and smoke from its nostrils, in\\nso strange a fashion that it appeared altogether a monstrous and\\nhorrible thing; and so long did he labour over making it, that the\\nstench of the dead animals in that room was past bearing, but\\nLeonardo did not notice it, so great was the love that he bore\\ntowards art. The work being finished, although it was no longer\\nasked for either by the countryman or by his father, Leonardo told\\nthe latter that he might send for the buckler at his convenience,\\nsince, for his part, it was finished. Ser Piero having therefore\\ngone one morning to the room for the buckler, and having knocked at\\nthe door, Leonardo opened to him, telling him to wait a little; and,\\nhaving gone back into the room, he adjusted the buckler in a good\\nlight on the easel, and put to the window, in order to make a soft\\nlight, and then he bade him come in to see it. Ser Piero, at the\\nfirst glance, taken by surprise, gave a sudden start, not thinking\\nthat that was the buckler, nor merely painted the form that he saw\\nupon it, and, falling back a step, Leonardo checked him, saying,\\n\"This work serves the end for which it was made; take it, then, and\\ncarry it away, since this is the effect that it was meant to\\nproduce.\" This thing appeared to Ser Piero nothing short of a\\nmiracle, and he praised very greatly the ingenious idea of Leonardo;\\nand then, having privately bought from a pedlar another buckler,\\npainted with a heart transfixed by an arrow, he presented it to the\\ncountryman, who remained obliged to him for it as long as he lived.\\nAfterwards, Ser Piero sold the buckler of Leonardo secretly to some\\nmerchants in Florence, for a hundred ducats; and in a short time it\\ncame into the hands of the Duke of Milan, having been sold to him by\\nthe said merchants for three hundred ducats.\\n\\nLeonardo then made a picture of Our Lady, a most excellent work,\\nwhich was in the possession of Pope Clement VII; and, among other\\nthings painted therein, he counterfeited a glass vase full of water,\\ncontaining some flowers, in which, besides its marvellous\\nnaturalness, he had imitated the dew-drops on the flowers, so that\\nit seemed more real than the reality. For Antonio Segni, who was\\nvery much his friend, he made, on a sheet of paper, a Neptune\\nexecuted with such careful draughtsmanship that it seemed absolutely\\nalive. In it one saw the ocean troubled, and Neptune\\'s car drawn by\\nsea-horses, with fantastic creatures, marine monsters and winds, and\\nsome very beautiful heads of sea-gods. This drawing was presented by\\nFabio, the son of Antonio, to Messer Giovanni Gaddi, with this\\nepigram:\\n\\n  Pinxit Virgilius Neptunum, pinxit Homerus,\\n    Dum maris undisoni per vada flectit equos.\\n  Mente quidem vates illum conspexit uterque,\\n    Vincius ast oculis; jureque vincit eos.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fancy came to him to paint a picture in oils of the head of a\\nMedusa, with the head attired with a coil of snakes, the most\\nstrange and extravagant invention that could ever be imagined;\\nbut since it was a work that took time, it remained unfinished, as\\nhappened with almost all his things. It is among the rare works of\\nart in the Palace of Duke Cosimo, together with the head of an\\nangel, who is raising one arm in the air, which, coming forward, is\\nforeshortened from the shoulder to the elbow, and with the other he\\nraises the hand to the breast.\\n\\nIt is an extraordinary thing how that genius, in his desire to give\\nthe highest relief to the works that he made, went so far with dark\\nshadows, in order to find the darkest possible grounds, that he\\nsought for blacks which might make deeper shadows and be darker than\\nother blacks, that by their means he might make his lights the\\nbrighter; and in the end this method turned out so dark, that, no\\nlight remaining there, his pictures had rather the character of\\nthings made to represent an effect of night, than the clear quality\\nof daylight; which all came from seeking to give greater relief, and\\nto achieve the final perfection of art.\\n\\nHe was so delighted when he saw certain bizarre heads of men, with\\nthe beard or hair growing naturally, that he would follow one that\\npleased him a whole day, and so treasured him up in idea, that\\nafterwards, on arriving home, he drew him as if he had had him in\\nhis presence. Of this sort there are many heads to be seen, both of\\nwomen and of men, and I have several of them, drawn by his hand with\\nthe pen, in our book of drawings, which I have mentioned so many\\ntimes; such was that of Amerigo Vespucci, which is a very beautiful\\nhead of an old man drawn with charcoal, and likewise that of\\nScaramuccia, Captain of the Gypsies, which afterwards came into the\\nhands of M. Donato Valdambrini of Arezzo, Canon of S. Lorenzo, left\\nto him by Giambullari.\\n\\nHe began a panel-picture of the Adoration of the Magi, containing\\nmany beautiful things, particularly the heads, which was in the\\nhouse of Amerigo Benci, opposite the Loggia de\\' Peruzzi; and this,\\nalso, remained unfinished, like his other works.\\n\\nIt came to pass that Giovan Galeazzo, Duke of Milan, being dead, and\\nLodovico Sforza raised to the same rank, in the year 1494, Leonardo\\nwas summoned to Milan in great repute to the Duke, who took much\\ndelight in the sound of the lyre, to the end that he might play it:\\nand Leonardo took with him that instrument which he had made with\\nhis own hands, in great part of silver, in the form of a horse\\'s\\nskull--a thing bizarre and new--in order that the harmony might be\\nof greater volume and more sonorous in tone; with which he surpassed\\nall the musicians who had come together there to play. Besides this,\\nhe was the best improviser in verse of his day. The Duke, hearing\\nthe marvellous discourse of Leonardo, became so enamoured of his\\ngenius, that it was something incredible: and he prevailed upon him\\nby entreaties to paint an altar-panel containing a Nativity, which\\nwas sent by the Duke to the Emperor.\\n\\nHe also painted in Milan, for the Friars of S. Dominic, at S. Maria\\ndelle Grazie, a Last Supper, a most beautiful and marvellous thing;\\nand to the heads of the Apostles he gave such majesty and beauty,\\nthat he left the head of Christ unfinished, not believing that he\\nwas able to give it that divine air which is essential to the image\\nof Christ. This work, remaining thus all but finished, has ever been\\nheld by the Milanese in the greatest veneration, and also by\\nstrangers as well; for Leonardo imagined and succeeded in expressing\\nthat anxiety which had seized the Apostles in wishing to know who\\nshould betray their Master. For which reason in all their faces are\\nseen love, fear, and wrath, or rather, sorrow, at not being able to\\nunderstand the meaning of Christ; which thing excites no less marvel\\nthan the sight, in contrast to it, of obstinacy, hatred, and\\ntreachery in Judas; not to mention that every least part of the work\\ndisplays an incredible diligence, seeing that even in the tablecloth\\nthe texture of the stuff is counterfeited in such a manner that\\nlinen itself could not seem more real.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is said that the Prior of that place kept pressing Leonardo, in a\\nmost importunate manner, to finish the work; for it seemed strange\\nto him to see Leonardo sometimes stand half a day at a time, lost in\\ncontemplation, and he would have liked him to go on like the\\nlabourers hoeing in his garden, without ever stopping his brush. And\\nnot content with this, he complained of it to the Duke, and that so\\nwarmly, that he was constrained to send for Leonardo and delicately\\nurged him to work, contriving nevertheless to show him that he was\\ndoing all this because of the importunity of the Prior. Leonardo,\\nknowing that the intellect of that Prince was acute and discerning,\\nwas pleased to discourse at large with the Duke on the subject, a\\nthing which he had never done with the Prior: and he reasoned much\\nwith him about art, and made him understand that men of lofty genius\\nsometimes accomplish the most when they work the least, seeking out\\ninventions with the mind, and forming those perfect ideas which the\\nhands afterwards express and reproduce from the images already\\nconceived in the brain. And he added that two heads were still\\nwanting for him to paint; that of Christ, which he did not wish to\\nseek on earth; and he could not think that it was possible to\\nconceive in the imagination that beauty and heavenly grace which\\nshould be the mark of God incarnate. Next, there was wanting that of\\nJudas, which was also troubling him, not thinking himself capable of\\nimagining features that should represent the countenance of him who,\\nafter so many benefits received, had a mind so cruel as to resolve\\nto betray his Lord, the Creator of the world. However, he would seek\\nout a model for the latter; but if in the end he could not find a\\nbetter, he should not want that of the importunate and tactless\\nPrior. This thing moved the Duke wondrously to laughter, and he said\\nthat Leonardo had a thousand reasons on his side. And so the poor\\nPrior, in confusion, confined himself to urging on the work in the\\ngarden, and left Leonardo in peace, who finished only the head of\\nJudas, which seems the very embodiment of treachery and inhumanity;\\nbut that of Christ, as has been said, remained unfinished. The\\nnobility of this picture, both because of its design, and from its\\nhaving been wrought with an incomparable diligence, awoke a desire\\nin the King of France to transport it into his kingdom; wherefore he\\ntried by all possible means to discover whether there were\\narchitects who, with cross-stays of wood and iron, might have been\\nable to make it so secure that it might be transported safely;\\nwithout considering any expense that might have been involved\\nthereby, so much did he desire it. But the fact of its being painted\\non the wall robbed his Majesty of his desire; and the picture\\nremained with the Milanese. In the same refectory, while he was\\nworking at the Last Supper, on the end wall where is a Passion in\\nthe old manner, Leonardo portrayed the said Lodovico, with\\nMassimiliano, his eldest son; and, on the other side, the Duchess\\nBeatrice, with Francesco, their other son, both of whom afterwards\\nbecame Dukes of Milan; and all are portrayed divinely well.\\n\\nWhile he was engaged on this work, he proposed to the Duke to make a\\nhorse in bronze, of a marvellous greatness, in order to place upon\\nit, as a memorial, the image of the Duke. And on so vast a scale did\\nhe begin it and continue it, that it could never be completed. And\\nthere are those who have been of the opinion (so various and so\\noften malign out of envy are the judgments of men) that he began it\\nwith no intention of finishing it, because, being of so great a\\nsize, an incredible difficulty was encountered in seeking to cast it\\nin one piece; and it might also be believed that, from the result,\\nmany may have formed such a judgment, since many of his works have\\nremained unfinished. But, in truth, one can believe that his vast\\nand most excellent mind was hampered through being too full of\\ndesire, and that his wish ever to seek out excellence upon\\nexcellence, and perfection upon perfection, was the reason of it.\\n\"Tal che l\\' opera fosse ritardata dal desio,\" as our Petrarca has\\nsaid. And, indeed, those who saw the great model that Leonardo made\\nin clay vow that they have never seen a more beautiful thing, or a\\nmore superb; and it was preserved until the French came to Milan\\nwith King Louis of France, and broke it all to pieces. Lost, also,\\nis a little model of it in wax, which was held to be perfect,\\ntogether with a book on the anatomy of the horse made by him by way\\nof study.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe then applied himself, but with greater care, to the anatomy of\\nman, assisted by and in turn assisting, in this research, Messer\\nMarc\\' Antonio della Torre, an excellent philosopher, who was then\\nlecturing at Pavia, and who wrote of this matter; and he was one of\\nthe first (as I have heard tell) that began to illustrate the\\nproblems of medicine with the doctrine of Galen, and to throw true\\nlight on anatomy, which up to that time had been wrapped in the\\nthick and gross darkness of ignorance. And in this he found\\nmarvellous aid in the brain, work, and hand of Leonardo, who made a\\nbook drawn in red chalk, and annotated with the pen, of the bodies\\nthat he dissected with his own hand, and drew with the greatest\\ndiligence; wherein he showed all the frame of the bones; and then\\nadded to them, in order, all the nerves, and covered them with\\nmuscles; the first attached to the bone, the second that hold the\\nbody firm, and the third that move it; and beside them, part by\\npart, he wrote in letters of an ill-shaped character, which he made\\nwith the left hand, backwards; and whoever is not practised in\\nreading them cannot understand them, since they are not to be read\\nsave with a mirror. Of these papers on the anatomy of man, a great\\npart is in the hands of Messer Francesco da Melzo, a gentleman of\\nMilan, who in the time of Leonardo was a very beautiful boy, and\\nmuch beloved by him, and now is a no less beautiful and gentle old\\nman; and he holds them dear, and keeps such papers together as if\\nthey were relics, in company with the portrait of Leonardo of happy\\nmemory; and to all who read these writings, it seems impossible that\\nthat divine spirit should have discoursed so well of art, and of the\\nmuscles, nerves, and veins, and with such diligence of everything.\\nSo, also, there are in the hands of ----, a painter of Milan,\\ncertain writings of Leonardo, likewise in characters written with\\nthe left hand, backwards, which treat of painting, and of the\\nmethods of drawing and colouring. This man, not long ago, came to\\nFlorence to see me, wishing to print this work, and he took it to\\nRome, in order to put it into effect; but I do not know what may\\nafterwards have become of it.\\n\\nAnd to return to the works of Leonardo; there came to Milan, in his\\ntime, the King of France, wherefore Leonardo being asked to devise\\nsome bizarre thing, made a lion which walked several steps and then\\nopened its breast, and showed it full of lilies.\\n\\nIn Milan he took for his assistant the Milanese Salai, who was most\\ncomely in grace and beauty, having fine locks, curling in ringlets,\\nin which Leonardo greatly delighted; and he taught him many things\\nof art; and certain works in Milan, which are said to be by Salai,\\nwere retouched by Leonardo.\\n\\nHe returned to Florence, where he found that the Servite Friars had\\nentrusted to Filippino the painting of the panel for the high-altar\\nof the Nunziata; whereupon Leonardo said that he would willingly\\nhave done such a work. Filippino, having heard this, like the\\namiable fellow that he was, retired from the undertaking; and the\\nfriars, to the end that Leonardo might paint it, took him into their\\nhouse, meeting the expenses both of himself and of all his\\nhousehold; and thus he kept them in expectation for a long time, but\\nnever began anything. In the end, he made a cartoon containing a\\nMadonna and a S. Anne, with a Christ, which not only caused all the\\ncraftsmen to marvel, but, when it was finished, men and women, young\\nand old, continued for two days to flock for a sight of it to the\\nroom where it was, as if to a solemn festival, in order to gaze at\\nthe marvels of Leonardo, which caused all those people to be amazed;\\nfor in the face of that Madonna was seen whatever of the simple and\\nthe beautiful can by simplicity and beauty confer grace on a picture\\nof the Mother of Christ, since he wished to show that modesty and\\nthat humility which are looked for in an image of the Virgin,\\nsupremely content with gladness at seeing the beauty of her Son,\\nwhom she was holding with tenderness in her lap, while with most\\nchastened gaze she was looking down at S. John, as a little boy, who\\nwas playing with a lamb; not without a smile from S. Anne, who,\\noverflowing with joy, was beholding her earthly progeny become\\ndivine--ideas truly worthy of the brain and genius of Leonardo. This\\ncartoon, as will be told below, afterwards went to France. He made a\\nportrait of Ginevra d\\' Amerigo Benci, a very beautiful work; and\\nabandoned the work for the friars, who restored it to Filippino; but\\nhe, also, failed to finish it, having been overtaken by death.\\n\\nLeonardo undertook to execute, for Francesco del Giocondo, the\\nportrait of Monna Lisa, his wife; and after toiling over it for four\\nyears, he left it unfinished; and the work is now in the collection\\nof King Francis of France, at Fontainebleau. In this head, whoever\\nwished to see how closely art could imitate nature, was able to\\ncomprehend it with ease; for in it were counterfeited all the\\nminutenesses that with subtlety are able to be painted, seeing that\\nthe eyes had that lustre and watery sheen which are always seen in\\nlife, and around them were all those rosy and pearly tints, as well\\nas the lashes, which cannot be represented without the greatest\\nsubtlety. The eyebrows, through his having shown the manner in\\nwhich the hairs spring from the flesh, here more close and here more\\nscanty, and curve according to the pores of the skin, could not be\\nmore natural. The nose, with its beautiful nostrils, rosy and\\ntender, appeared to be alive. The mouth, with its opening, and with\\nits ends united by the red of the lips to the flesh-tints of the\\nface, seemed, in truth, to be not colours but flesh. In the pit of\\nthe throat, if one gazed upon it intently, could be seen the beating\\nof the pulse. And, indeed, it may be said that it was painted in\\nsuch a manner as to make every valiant craftsman, be he who he may,\\ntremble and lose heart. He made use, also, of this device: Monna\\nLisa being very beautiful, he always employed, while he was painting\\nher portrait, persons to play or sing, and jesters, who might make\\nher remain merry, in order to take away that melancholy which\\npainters are often wont to give to the portraits that they paint.\\nAnd in this work of Leonardo\\'s there was a smile so pleasing, that\\nit was a thing more divine than human to behold; and it was held to\\nbe something marvellous, since the reality was not more alive.\\n\\nBy reason, then, of the excellence of the works of this most divine\\ncraftsman, his fame had so increased that all persons who took\\ndelight in art--nay, the whole city of Florence--desired that he\\nshould leave them some memorial, and it was being proposed\\neverywhere that he should be commissioned to execute some great and\\nnotable work, whereby the commonwealth might be honoured and adorned\\nby the great genius, grace and judgment that were seen in the works\\nof Leonardo. And it was decided between the Gonfalonier and the\\nchief citizens, the Great Council Chamber having been newly\\nbuilt--the architecture of which had been contrived with the\\njudgment and counsel of Giuliano da San Gallo, Simone Pollaiuolo,\\ncalled Il Cronaca, Michelagnolo Buonarroti, and Baccio d\\' Agnolo, as\\nwill be related with more detail in the proper places--and having\\nbeen finished in great haste, it was ordained by public decree that\\nLeonardo should be given some beautiful work to paint; and so the\\nsaid hall was allotted to him by Piero Soderini, then Gonfalonier of\\nJustice. Whereupon Leonardo, determining to execute this work, began\\na cartoon in the Sala del Papa, an apartment in S. Maria Novella,\\nrepresenting the story of Niccolò Piccinino, Captain of Duke\\nFilippo of Milan; wherein he designed a group of horsemen who were\\nfighting for a standard, a work that was held to be very excellent\\nand of great mastery, by reason of the marvellous ideas that he had\\nin composing that battle; seeing that in it rage, fury, and revenge\\nare perceived as much in the men as in the horses, among which two\\nwith the fore-legs interlocked are fighting no less fiercely with\\ntheir teeth than those who are riding them do in fighting for that\\nstandard, which has been grasped by a soldier, who seeks by the\\nstrength of his shoulders, as he spurs his horse to flight, having\\nturned his body backwards and seized the staff of the standard, to\\nwrest it by force from the hands of four others, of whom two are\\ndefending it, each with one hand, and, raising their swords in the\\nother, are trying to sever the staff; while an old soldier in a red\\ncap, crying out, grips the staff with one hand, and, raising a\\nscimitar with the other, furiously aims a blow in order to cut off\\nboth the hands of those who, gnashing their teeth in the struggle,\\nare striving in attitudes of the utmost fierceness to defend their\\nbanner; besides which, on the ground, between the legs of the\\nhorses, there are two figures in foreshortening that are fighting\\ntogether, and the one on the ground has over him a soldier who has\\nraised his arm as high as possible, that thus with greater force he\\nmay plunge a dagger into his throat, in order to end his life; while\\nthe other, struggling with his legs and arms, is doing what he can\\nto escape death.\\n\\nIt is not possible to describe the invention that Leonardo showed in\\nthe garments of the soldiers, all varied by him in different ways,\\nand likewise in the helmet-crests and other ornaments; not to\\nmention the incredible mastery that he displayed in the forms and\\nlineaments of the horses, which Leonardo, with their fiery spirit,\\nmuscles, and shapely beauty, drew better than any other master. It\\nis said that, in order to draw that cartoon, he made a most\\ningenious stage, which was raised by contracting it and lowered by\\nexpanding. And conceiving the wish to colour on the wall in oils, he\\nmade a composition of so gross an admixture, to act as a binder on\\nthe wall, that, going on to paint in the said hall, it began to peel\\noff in such a manner that in a short time he abandoned it, seeing it\\nspoiling.\\n\\n\\n\\nLeonardo had very great spirit, and in his every action was most\\ngenerous. It is said that, going to the bank for the allowance that\\nhe used to draw every month from Piero Soderini, the cashier wanted\\nto give him certain paper-packets of pence; but he would not take\\nthem, saying in answer, \"I am no penny-painter.\" Having been blamed\\nfor cheating Piero Soderini, there began to be murmurings against\\nhim; wherefore Leonardo so wrought upon his friends, that he got the\\nmoney together and took it to Piero to repay him; but he would not\\naccept it.\\n\\nHe went to Rome with Duke Giuliano de\\' Medici, at the election of\\nPope Leo, who spent much of his time on philosophical studies, and\\nparticularly on alchemy; where, forming a paste of a certain kind of\\nwax, as he walked he shaped animals very thin and full of wind, and,\\nby blowing into them, made them fly through the air, but when the\\nwind ceased they fell to the ground. On the back of a most bizarre\\nlizard, found by the vine-dresser of the Belvedere, he fixed, with a\\nmixture of quicksilver, wings composed of scales stripped from other\\nlizards, which, as it walked, quivered with the motion; and having\\ngiven it eyes, horns, and beard, taming it, and keeping it in a box,\\nhe made all his friends, to whom he showed it, fly for fear. He used\\noften to have the guts of a wether completely freed of their fat and\\ncleaned, and thus made so fine that they could have been held in the\\npalm of the hand; and having placed a pair of blacksmith\\'s bellows\\nin another room, he fixed to them one end of these, and, blowing\\ninto them, filled the room, which was very large, so that whoever\\nwas in it was obliged to retreat into a corner; showing how,\\ntransparent and full of wind, from taking up little space at the\\nbeginning they had come to occupy much, and likening them to virtue.\\nHe made an infinite number of such follies, and gave his attention\\nto mirrors; and he tried the strangest methods in seeking out oils\\nfor painting, and varnish for preserving works when painted.\\n\\nHe made at this time, for Messer Baldassarre Turini da Pescia, who\\nwas Datary to Pope Leo, a little picture of the Madonna with the\\nChild in her arms, with infinite diligence and art; but whether\\nthrough the fault of whoever primed the panel with gesso, or because\\nof his innumerable and capricious mixtures of grounds and colours,\\nit is now much spoilt. And in another small picture he made a\\nportrait of a little boy, which is beautiful and graceful to a\\nmarvel; and both of them are now at Pescia, in the hands of Messer\\nGiuliano Turini. It is related that, a work having been allotted to\\nhim by the Pope, he straightway began to distil oils and herbs, in\\norder to make the varnish; at which Pope Leo said: \"Alas! this man\\nwill never do anything, for he begins by thinking of the end of the\\nwork, before the beginning.\"\\n\\nThere was very great disdain between Michelagnolo Buonarroti and\\nhim, on account of which Michelagnolo departed from Florence, with\\nthe excuse of Duke Giuliano, having been summoned by the Pope to the\\ncompetition for the façade of S. Lorenzo. Leonardo, understanding\\nthis, departed and went into France, where the King, having had\\nworks by his hand, bore him great affection; and he desired that he\\nshould colour the cartoon of S. Anne, but Leonardo, according to his\\ncustom, put him off for a long time with words.\\n\\nFinally, having grown old, he remained ill many months, and, feeling\\nhimself near to death, asked to have himself diligently informed of\\nthe teaching of the Catholic faith, and of the good way and holy\\nChristian religion; and then, with many moans, he confessed and was\\npenitent; and although he could not raise himself well on his feet,\\nsupporting himself on the arms of his friends and servants, he was\\npleased to take devoutly the most holy Sacrament, out of his bed.\\nThe King, who was wont often and lovingly to visit him, then came\\ninto the room; wherefore he, out of reverence, having raised himself\\nto sit upon the bed, giving him an account of his sickness and the\\ncircumstances of it, showed withal how much he had offended God and\\nmankind in not having worked at his art as he should have done.\\nThereupon he was seized by a paroxysm, the messenger of death; for\\nwhich reason the King having risen and having taken his head, in\\norder to assist him and show him favour, to the end that he might\\nalleviate his pain, his spirit, which was divine, knowing that it\\ncould not have any greater honour, expired in the arms of the King,\\nin the seventy-fifth year of his age.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe loss of Leonardo grieved beyond measure all those who had known\\nhim, since there was never any one who did so much honour to\\npainting. With the splendour of his aspect, which was very\\nbeautiful, he made serene every broken spirit: and with his\\nwords he turned to yea, or nay, every obdurate intention. By his\\nphysical force he could restrain any outburst of rage: and with his\\nright hand he twisted the iron ring of a door-bell, or a horse-shoe,\\nas if it were lead. With his liberality he would assemble together\\nand support his every friend, poor or rich, if only he had intellect\\nand worth. He adorned and honoured, in every action, no matter what\\nmean and bare dwelling; wherefore, in truth, Florence received a\\nvery great gift in the birth of Leonardo, and an incalculable loss\\nin his death. In the art of painting, he added to the manner of\\ncolouring in oils a certain obscurity, whereby the moderns have\\ngiven great force and relief to their figures. And in statuary, he\\nproved his worth in the three figures of bronze that are over the\\ndoor of S. Giovanni, on the side towards the north, executed by\\nGiovan Francesco Rustici, but contrived with the advice of Leonardo;\\nwhich are the most beautiful pieces of casting, the best designed,\\nand the most perfect that have as yet been seen in modern days. By\\nLeonardo we have the anatomy of the horse, and that of man even more\\ncomplete. And so, on account of all his qualities, so many and so\\ndivine, although he worked much more by words than by deeds, his\\nname and fame can never be extinguished; wherefore it was thus said\\nin his praise by Messer Giovan Battista Strozzi:\\n\\n  Vince costui pur solo\\n  Tutti altri; e vince Fidia e vince Apelle\\n  E tutto il lor vittorioso stuolo.\\n\\n\\n\\nA disciple of Leonardo was Giovan Antonio Boltraffio of Milan, a\\nperson of great skill and understanding, who, in the year 1500,\\npainted with much diligence, for the Church of the Misericordia,\\nwithout Bologna, a panel in oils containing Our Lady with the Child\\nin her arms, S. John the Baptist, S. Sebastian naked, and the patron\\nwho caused it to be executed, portrayed from the life, on his\\nknees--a truly beautiful work, on which he wrote his name, calling\\nhimself a disciple of Leonardo. He has made other works, both at\\nMilan and elsewhere; but it must be enough here to have named this,\\nwhich is the best. Another (of his disciples) was Marco Oggioni, who\\npainted, in S. Maria della Pace, the Passing of Our Lady and the\\nMarriage of Cana in Galilee.\\n\\n\\nGIORGIONE DA CASTELFRANCO\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " \" OF GIORGIONE DA CASTELFRANCO\\n\\nPAINTER OF VENICE\\n\\n\\nAt the same time when Florence was acquiring such fame by reason of\\nthe works of Leonardo, no little adornment was conferred on Venice\\nby the talent and excellence of one of her citizens, who surpassed\\nby a great measure not only the Bellini, whom the Venetians held in\\nsuch esteem, but also every other master who had painted up to that\\ntime in that city. This was Giorgio, who was born at Castelfranco in\\nthe territory of Treviso, in the year 1478, when the Doge was\\nGiovanni Mozzenigo, brother of Doge Piero. In time, from the nature\\nof his person and from the greatness of his mind, Giorgio came to be\\ncalled Giorgione; and although he was born from very humble stock,\\nnevertheless he was not otherwise than gentle and of good breeding\\nthroughout his whole life. He was brought up in Venice, and took\\nunceasing delight in the joys of love; and the sound of the lute\\ngave him marvellous pleasure, so that in his day he played and sang\\nso divinely that he was often employed for that purpose at various\\nmusical assemblies and gatherings of noble persons. He studied\\ndrawing, and found it greatly to his taste; and in this nature\\nfavoured him so highly, that he, having become enamoured of her\\nbeauties, would never represent anything in his works without\\ncopying it from life; and so much was he her slave, imitating her\\ncontinuously, that he acquired the name not only of having surpassed\\nGiovanni and Gentile Bellini, but also of being the rival of the\\nmasters who were working in Tuscany and who were the creators of the\\nmodern manner. Giorgione had seen some things by the hand of\\nLeonardo with a beautiful gradation of colours, and with\\nextraordinary relief, effected, as has been related, by means of\\ndark shadows; and this manner pleased him so much that he was for\\never studying it as long as he lived, and in oil-painting he\\nimitated it greatly. Taking pleasure in the delights of good work,\\nhe was ever selecting, for putting into his pictures, the greatest\\nbeauty and the greatest variety that he could find. And nature gave\\nhim a spirit so benign, and with this, both in oil-painting and in\\nfresco, he made certain living forms and other things so soft, so\\nwell harmonized, and so well blended in the shadows, that many of\\nthe excellent masters of his time were forced to confess that he had\\nbeen born to infuse spirit into figures and to counterfeit the\\nfreshness of living flesh better than any other painter, not only in\\nVenice, but throughout the whole world.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn his youth he executed in Venice many pictures of Our Lady and\\nother portraits from nature, which are very lifelike and beautiful;\\nof which we still have proof in three most beautiful heads in oils\\nby his hand, which are in the study of the Very Reverend Grimani,\\nPatriarch of Aquileia. One represents David--and it is reported to\\nbe his own portrait--with long locks reaching to the shoulders, as\\nwas the custom of those times; it is so vivacious and so fresh in\\ncolouring that it seems to be living flesh, and there is armour on\\nthe breast, as there is on the arm with which he is holding the\\nsevered head of Goliath. The second is a much larger head, portrayed\\nfrom nature; one hand is holding the red cap of a commander, and\\nthere is a cape of fur, below which is one of the old-fashioned\\ndoublets. This is believed to represent some military leader. The\\nthird is that of a boy, as beautiful as could be, with fleecy hair.\\nThese works demonstrate the excellence of Giorgione, and no less the\\naffection which that great Patriarch has ever borne to his genius,\\nholding them very dear, and that rightly. In Florence, in the house\\nof the sons of Giovanni Borgherini, there is a portrait by his hand\\nof the said Giovanni, taken when he was a young man in Venice, and\\nin the same picture is the master who was teaching him; and there\\nare no two heads to be seen with better touches in the flesh-colours\\nor with more beautiful tints in the shadows. In the house of Anton\\nde' Nobili there is another head of a captain in armour, very lively\\nand spirited, which is said to be one of the captains whom Consalvo\\nFerrante took with him to Venice when he visited Doge Agostino\\nBarberigo; at which time, it is related, Giorgione made a\\nportrait of the great Consalvo in armour, which was a very rare\\nwork, insomuch that there was no more beautiful painting than this\\nto be seen, and Consalvo took it away with him. Giorgione made many\\nother portraits which are scattered throughout many parts of Italy;\\nall very beautiful, as may be believed from that of Leonardo\\nLoredano, painted by Giorgione when Leonardo was Doge, which I saw\\nexhibited on one Ascension day, when I seemed to see that most\\nillustrious Prince alive. There is also one at Faenza, in the house\\nof Giovanni da Castel Bolognese, an excellent engraver of cameos and\\ncrystals; which work, executed for his father-in-law, is truly\\ndivine, since there is such a harmony in the gradation of the\\ncolours that it appears to be rather in relief than painted.\\n\\nGiorgione took much delight in painting in fresco, and one among\\nmany works that he executed was the whole of a façade of the Ca\\nSoranzo on the Piazza di S. Polo; wherein, besides many pictures and\\nscenes and other things of fancy, there may be seen a picture\\npainted in oils on the plaster, a work which has withstood rain,\\nsun, and wind, and has remained fresh up to our own day. There is\\nalso a Spring, which appears to me to be one of the most beautiful\\nworks that he painted in fresco, and it is a great pity that time\\nhas consumed it so cruelly. For my part, I know nothing that injures\\nworks in fresco more than the sirocco, and particularly near the\\nsea, where it always brings a salt moisture with it.\\n\\nThere broke out at Venice, in the year 1504, in the Fondaco de'\\nTedeschi by the Ponte del Rialto, a most terrible fire, which\\nconsumed the whole building and all the merchandise, to the very\\ngreat loss of the merchants; wherefore the Signoria of Venice\\nordained that it should be rebuilt anew, and it was speedily\\nfinished with more accommodation in the way of living-rooms, and\\nwith greater magnificence, adornment, and beauty. Thereupon, the\\nfame of Giorgione having grown great, it was ordained after\\ndeliberation by those who had charge of the matter, that Giorgione\\nshould paint it in fresco with colours according to his own fancy,\\nprovided only that he gave proof of his genius and executed an\\nexcellent work, since it would be in the most beautiful place and\\nmost conspicuous site in the city. And so Giorgione put his hand to\\nthe work, but thought of nothing save of making figures according\\nto his own fancy, in order to display his art, so that, in truth,\\nthere are no scenes to be found there with any order, or\\nrepresenting the deeds of any distinguished person, either ancient\\nor modern; and I, for my part, have never understood them, nor have\\nI found, for all the inquiries that I have made, anyone who\\nunderstands them, for in one place there is a woman, in another a\\nman, in diverse attitudes, while one has the head of a lion near\\nhim, and another an angel in the guise of a Cupid, nor can one tell\\nwhat it may all mean. There is, indeed, over the principal door,\\nwhich opens into the Merceria, a woman seated who has at her feet\\nthe severed head of a giant, almost in the form of a Judith; she is\\nraising the head with her sword, and speaking with a German, who is\\nbelow her; but I have not been able to determine for what he\\nintended her to stand, unless, indeed, he may have meant her to\\nrepresent Germany. However, it may be seen that his figures are well\\ngrouped, and that he was ever making progress; and there are in it\\nheads and parts of figures very well painted, and most vivacious in\\ncolouring. In all that he did there he aimed at being faithful to\\nnature, without any imitation of another's manner; and the work is\\ncelebrated and famous in Venice, no less for what he painted therein\\nthan through its convenience for commerce and its utility to the\\ncommonwealth.\\n\\nHe executed a picture of Christ bearing the Cross, with a Jew\\ndragging him along, which in time was placed in the Church of S.\\nRocco, and which now, through the veneration that many feel for it,\\nworks miracles, as all may see. He worked in various places, such as\\nCastelfranco, and throughout the territory of Treviso, and he made\\nmany portraits for Italian Princes; and many of his works were sent\\nout of Italy, as things truly worthy to bear testimony that if\\nTuscany had a superabundance of craftsmen in every age, the region\\nbeyond, near the mountains, was not always abandoned and forgotten\\nby Heaven.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is related that Giorgione, at the time when Andrea Verrocchio was\\nmaking his bronze horse, fell into an argument with certain\\nsculptors, who maintained, since sculpture showed various attitudes\\nand aspects in one single figure to one walking round it, that for\\nthis reason it surpassed painting, which only showed one side\\nof a figure. Giorgione was of the opinion that there could be shown\\nin a painted scene, without any necessity for walking round, at one\\nsingle glance, all the various aspects that a man can present in\\nmany gestures--a thing which sculpture cannot do without a change of\\nposition and point of view, so that in her case the points of view\\nare many, and not one. Moreover, he proposed to show in one single\\npainted figure the front, the back, and the profile on either side,\\na challenge which brought them to their senses; and he did it in the\\nfollowing way. He painted a naked man with his back turned, at whose\\nfeet was a most limpid pool of water, wherein he painted the\\nreflection of the man's front. At one side was a burnished cuirass\\nthat he had taken off, which showed his left profile, since\\neverything could be seen on the polished surface of the piece of\\narmour; and on the other side was a mirror, which reflected the\\nother profile of the naked figure; which was a thing of most\\nbeautiful and bizarre fancy, whereby he sought to prove that\\npainting does in fact, with more excellence, labour, and effect,\\nachieve more at one single view of a living figure than does\\nsculpture. And this work was greatly extolled and admired, as\\nsomething ingenious and beautiful.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe also made a portrait from life of Caterina, Queen of Cyprus,\\nwhich I once saw in the hands of the illustrious Messer Giovanni\\nCornaro. There is in our book a head coloured in oils, the portrait\\nof a German of the Fugger family, who was at that time one of the\\nchief merchants in the Fondaco de' Tedeschi, which is an admirable\\nwork; together with other sketches and drawings made by him with the\\npen.\\n\\nWhile Giorgione was employed in doing honour both to himself and to\\nhis country, and frequenting many houses in order to entertain his\\nvarious friends with his music, he became enamoured of a lady, and\\nthey took much joy, one with another, in their love. Now it happened\\nthat in the year 1511 she became infected with plague, without,\\nhowever, knowing anything about it; and Giorgione, visiting her as\\nusual, caught the plague in such a manner, that in a short time, at\\nthe age of thirty-four, he passed away to the other life, not\\nwithout infinite grief on the part of his many friends, who loved\\nhim for his virtues, and great hurt to the world, which thus lost\\nhim. However, they could bear up against this hurt and loss, in that\\nhe left behind him two excellent disciples in Sebastiano, the\\nVenetian, who afterwards became Friar of the Piombo at Rome, and\\nTiziano da Cadore, who not only equalled him, but surpassed him\\ngreatly; of both of whom we will speak at the proper time,\\ndescribing fully the honour and benefit that they have conferred on\\nart.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nANTONIO DA CORREGGIO\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \" OF ANTONIO DA CORREGGIO\\n\\nPAINTER\\n\\n\\nI do not wish to leave that country wherein our great mother Nature,\\nin order not to be thought partial, gave to the world extraordinary\\nmen of that sort with which she had already for many and many a year\\nadorned Tuscany; among whom was one endowed with an excellent and\\nvery beautiful genius, by name Antonio da Correggio, a most rare\\npainter, who acquired the modern manner so perfectly, that in a few\\nyears, what with his natural gifts and his practice in art, he\\nbecame a most excellent and marvellous craftsman. He was very timid\\nby nature, and with great discomfort to himself he was continually\\nlabouring at the exercise of his art, for the sake of his family,\\nwhich weighed upon him; and although it was a natural goodness that\\nimpelled him, nevertheless he afflicted himself more than was right\\nin bearing the burden of those sufferings which are wont to crush\\nmankind. He was very melancholy in his practice of art, a slave to\\nher labours, and an unwearying investigator of all the difficulties\\nof her realm; to which witness is borne by a vast multitude of\\nfigures in the Duomo of Parma, executed in fresco and well finished,\\nwhich are to be found in the great tribune of the said church, and\\nare seen foreshortened from below with an effect of marvellous\\ngrandeur.\\n\\nAntonio was the first who began to work in the modern manner in\\nLombardy; wherefore it is thought that if he, with his genius, had\\ngone forth from Lombardy and lived in Rome, he would have wrought\\nmiracles, and would have brought the sweat to the brow of many who\\nwere held to be great men in his time. For, his works being such as\\nthey are without his having seen any of the ancient or the best of\\nthe modern, it necessarily follows that, if he had seen them, he\\nwould have vastly improved his own, and, advancing from good to\\nbetter, would have reached the highest rank. It may, at least, be\\nheld for certain that no one ever handled colours better than he,\\nand that no craftsman ever painted with greater delicacy or with\\nmore relief, such was the softness of his flesh-painting, and such\\nthe grace with which he finished his works.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the same place, also, he painted two large pictures executed in\\noils, in one of which, among other figures, there may be seen a Dead\\nChrist, which was highly extolled. And in S. Giovanni, in the same\\ncity, he painted a tribune in fresco, wherein he represented Our\\nLady ascending into Heaven amidst a multitude of angels, with other\\nsaints around; as to which, it seems impossible that he should have\\nbeen able, I do not say to express it with his hand, but even to\\nconceive it in his imagination, so beautiful are the curves of the\\ndraperies and the expressions that he gave to those figures. Of\\nthese there are some drawings in our book, done in red chalk by his\\nhand, with some very beautiful borders of little boys, and other\\nborders drawn in that work by way of ornament, with various fanciful\\nscenes of sacrifices in the ancient manner. And in truth, if Antonio\\nhad not brought his works to that perfection which is seen in them,\\nhis drawings (although they show excellence of manner, and the charm\\nand practised touch of a master) would not have gained for him among\\ncraftsmen the name that he has won with his wonderful paintings.\\nThis art is so difficult, and has so many branches, that very often\\na craftsman is not able to practise them all to perfection; for\\nthere have been many who have drawn divinely well, but have shown\\nsome imperfection in colouring, and others have been marvellous in\\ncolouring, but have not drawn half so well. All this depends on\\nchoice, and on the practice bestowed, in youth, in one case on\\ndrawing, in another on colour. But since all is learnt in order to\\ncarry works to the height of perfection, which is to put good\\ncolouring, together with draughtsmanship, into everything that is\\nexecuted, for this reason Correggio deserves great praise, having\\nattained to the height of perfection in the works that he coloured\\neither in oils or in fresco; as he did in the Church of the Frati\\nde' Zoccoli di S. Francesco, in the same city, where he painted\\nan Annunciation in fresco so well, that, when it became necessary to\\npull it down in making some changes in that building, those friars\\ncaused the wall round it to be bound with timber strengthened with\\niron, and, cutting it away little by little, they saved it; and it\\nwas built by them into a more secure place in the same convent.\\n\\nHe painted, also, over one of the gates of that city, a Madonna who\\nhas the Child in her arms; and it is an astounding thing to see the\\nlovely colouring of this work in fresco, through which he has won\\nfrom passing strangers, who have seen nothing else of his, infinite\\npraise and honour. For S. Antonio, likewise in that city, he painted\\na panel wherein is a Madonna, with S. Mary Magdalene; and near them\\nis a boy in the guise of a little angel, holding a book in his hand,\\nwho is smiling, with a smile that seems so natural that he moves\\nwhoever beholds him to smile also, nor can any person, be his nature\\never so melancholy, see him without being cheered. There is also a\\nS. Jerome; and the whole work is coloured in a manner so wonderful\\nand so astounding, that painters revere it for the marvel of its\\ncolouring, and it is scarcely possible to paint better.\\n\\nIn like manner, he executed square pictures and other paintings for\\nmany lords throughout Lombardy; and, among other works, two pictures\\nin Mantua for Duke Federigo II, to be sent to the Emperor, a gift\\ntruly worthy of such a Prince. Giulio Romano, seeing these works,\\nsaid that he had never seen any colouring that attained to such\\nperfection. One was a naked Leda, and the other a Venus; both so\\nsoft in colouring, with the shadows of the flesh so well wrought,\\nthat they appeared to be not colours, but flesh. In one there was a\\nmarvellous landscape, nor was there ever a Lombard who painted such\\nthings better than he; and, besides this, hair so lovely in colour,\\nand executed in detail with such exquisite finish, that it is not\\npossible to see anything better. There were also certain Loves,\\nexecuted with beautiful art, who were making trial of their arrows,\\nsome of gold and some of lead, on a stone; and what lent most grace\\nto the Venus was a clear and limpid stream, which ran among some\\nstones and bathed her feet, but scarcely concealed any part of them,\\nso that the sight of their delicate whiteness was a moving thing\\nfor the eye to behold. For which reason Antonio most certainly\\ndeserved all praise and honour during his lifetime, and the greatest\\nglory from the lips and pens of men after his death.\\n\\nIn Modena, also, he painted a panel-picture of Our Lady, which is\\nheld in esteem by all painters, as the best picture in that city. In\\nBologna, likewise, in the house of the Ercolani, gentlemen of that\\ncity, there is a work by his hand, a Christ appearing to Mary\\nMagdalene in the Garden, which is very beautiful. In Reggio there\\nwas a rare and most beautiful picture; and not long since, Messer\\nLuciano Pallavigino, who takes much delight in noble paintings,\\npassing through the city and seeing it, gave no thought to the cost,\\nand, as if he had bought a jewel, sent it to his house in Genoa. At\\nReggio, likewise, is a panel containing a Nativity of Christ,\\nwherein the splendour radiating from Him throws its light on the\\nshepherds and all around on the figures that are contemplating Him;\\nand among the many conceptions shown in that subject, there is a\\nwoman who, wishing to gaze intently at Christ, and not being able\\nwith her mortal sight to bear the light of His Divinity, which seems\\nto be beating upon her with its rays, places a hand before her eyes;\\nwhich is expressed so well that it is a marvel. Over the hut is a\\nchoir of angels singing, who are so well executed, that they appear\\nrather to have rained down from Heaven than to have been made by the\\nhand of a painter. And in the same city there is a little picture, a\\nfoot square, the rarest and most beautiful work that is to be seen\\nby his hand, of Christ in the Garden, representing an effect of\\nnight, and painted with little figures; wherein the Angel, appearing\\nto Christ, illumines Him with the splendour of his light, with such\\ntruth to nature, that nothing better can be imagined or expressed.\\nBelow, on a plain at the foot of the mountain, are seen the three\\nApostles sleeping, over whom the mountain on which Christ is praying\\ncasts a shadow, giving those figures a force which one is not able\\nto describe. Far in the background, over a distant landscape, there\\nis shown the appearing of the dawn; and on one side are seen coming\\nsome soldiers, with Judas. And although it is so small, this scene\\nis so well conceived, that there is no work of the same kind to\\nequal it either in patience or in study.\\n\\n\\n\\nMany things might be said of the works of this master; but since,\\namong the eminent men of our art, everything that is to be seen by\\nhis hand is admired as something divine, I will say no more. I have\\nused all possible diligence in order to obtain his portrait, but,\\nsince he himself did not make it, and he was never portrayed by\\nothers, for he always lived in retirement, I have not been able to\\nfind one. He was, in truth, a person who had no opinion of himself,\\nnor did he believe himself to be an able master of his art,\\ncontrasting his deficiencies with that perfection which he would\\nhave liked to achieve. He was contented with little, and he lived\\nlike an excellent Christian.\\n\\n\\n\\nAntonio, like a man who was weighed down by his family, was anxious\\nto be always saving, and he had thereby become as miserly as he\\ncould well be. Wherefore it is related that, having received at\\nParma a payment of sixty crowns in copper coins, and wishing to take\\nthem to Correggio to meet some demand, he placed the money on his\\nback and set out to walk on foot; but, being smitten by the heat of\\nthe sun, which was very great, and drinking water to refresh\\nhimself, he was seized by pleurisy, and had to take to his bed in a\\nraging fever, nor did he ever raise his head from it, but finished\\nthe course of his life at the age of forty, or thereabout.\\n\\nHis pictures date about 1512; and he bestowed a very great gift on\\npainting by his handling of colours, which was that of a true\\nmaster; and it was by means of him that men's eyes were opened in\\nLombardy, where so many beautiful intellects have been seen in\\npainting, following him in making works worthy of praise and memory.\\nThus, by showing them his treatment of hair, executed with such\\nfacility, for all the difficulty of painting it, he taught them how\\nit should be painted; for which all painters owe him an everlasting\\ndebt. At their instance the following epigram was written to him by\\nMesser Fabio Segni, a gentleman of Florence:\\n\\n  Hujus cum regeret mortales spiritus artus\\n    Pictoris, Charites supplicuere Jovi.\\n  Non alia pingi dextra, Pater alme, rogamus;\\n    Hunc præter, nulli pingere nos liceat.\\n  Annuit his votis summi regnator Olympi,\\n    Et juvenem subito sidera ad alta tulit,\\n  Ut posset melius Charitum simulacra referre\\n    Præsens, et nudas cerneret inde Deas.\\n\\nAt this same time lived Andrea del Gobbo of Milan, a very pleasing\\npainter and colourist, many of whose works are scattered about in\\nthe houses of his native city of Milan. There is a large\\npanel-picture of the Assumption of Our Lady, by his hand, in the\\nCertosa of Pavia, but it was left unfinished, on account of death\\novertaking him; which panel shows how excellent he was, and how\\ngreat a lover of the labours of art.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPIERO DI COSIMO\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " ' OF PIERO DI COSIMO\\n\\nPAINTER OF FLORENCE\\n\\n\\nWhile Giorgione and Correggio, to their own great credit and glory,\\nwere honouring the regions of Lombardy, Tuscany, on her part, was\\nnot wanting in men of beautiful intellect; among whom, not one of\\nthe least was Piero, the son of one Lorenzo, a goldsmith, and a\\npupil of Cosimo Rosselli, after whom he was always called Piero di\\nCosimo, and known by no other name. And in truth, when a man teaches\\nus excellence and gives us the secret of living rightly, he deserves\\nno less gratitude from us, and should be held no less as a true\\nfather, than he who begets us and gives us life and nothing more.\\n\\nPiero was entrusted by his father, who saw in his son a lively\\nintelligence and an inclination to the art of design, to the care of\\nCosimo, who took him with no ordinary willingness; and seeing him\\ngrow no less in ability than in years, among the many disciples that\\nhe had, he bore him love as to a son, and always held him as such.\\nThis young man had by nature a most lofty spirit, and he was very\\nstrange, and different in fancy from the other youths who were\\nworking with Cosimo in order to learn the same art. He was at times\\nso intent on what he was doing, that when some subject was being\\ndiscussed, as often happens, at the end of the discussion it was\\nnecessary to go back to the beginning and tell him the whole, so far\\nhad his brain wandered after some other fancy of his own. And he was\\nlikewise so great a lover of solitude, that he knew no pleasure save\\nthat of going off by himself with his thoughts, letting his fancy\\nroam and building his castles in the air. Right good reason had\\nCosimo, his master, for wishing him well, seeing that he made so\\nmuch use of him in his works, that very often he caused him to\\nexecute things of great importance, knowing that Piero had a more\\nbeautiful manner, as well as better judgment, than himself. For this\\nreason he took Piero with him to Rome, when he was summoned thither\\nby Pope Sixtus in order to paint the scenes in his chapel; in one of\\nwhich Piero executed a very beautiful landscape, as was related in\\nthe Life of Cosimo.\\n\\nAnd since Piero drew most excellently from the life, he made in Rome\\nmany portraits of distinguished persons; in particular, those of\\nVirginio Orsino and Ruberto Sanseverino, which he placed in the\\naforesaid scenes. Afterwards, also, he made a portrait of Duke\\nValentino, the son of Pope Alexander VI; which painting, to my\\nknowledge, is not now to be found; but the cartoon by his hand still\\nexists, being in the possession of the reverend and cultured M.\\nCosimo Bartoli, Provost of S. Giovanni. In Florence, he painted many\\npictures for a number of citizens, which are dispersed among their\\nvarious houses, and of such I have seen some that are very good; and\\nso, also, various things for many other persons. In the Noviciate of\\nS. Marco is a picture by his hand of Our Lady, standing, with the\\nChild in her arms, coloured in oils. And for the Chapel of Gino\\nCapponi, in the Church of S. Spirito at Florence, he painted a panel\\nwherein is the Visitation of Our Lady, with S. Nicholas, and a S.\\nAnthony who is reading with a pair of spectacles on his nose, a very\\nspirited figure. Here he counterfeited a book bound in parchment,\\nsomewhat old, which seems to be real, and also some balls that he\\ngave to the S. Nicholas, shining and casting gleams of light and\\nreflections from one to another; from which even by that time men\\ncould perceive the strangeness of his brain, and his constant\\nseeking after difficulties.\\n\\n\\n\\nEven better did he show this after the death of Cosimo, when he kept\\nhimself constantly shut up, and would not let himself be seen at\\nwork, leading the life of a man who was less man than beast. He\\nwould never have his rooms swept, he would only eat when hunger came\\nto him, and he would not let his garden be worked or his fruit-trees\\npruned; nay, he allowed his vines to grow, and the shoots to trail\\nover the ground, nor were his fig-trees ever trimmed, or any other\\ntrees, for it pleased him to see everything wild, like his own\\nnature; and he declared that Nature\\'s own things should be left to\\nher to look after, without lifting a hand to them. He set himself\\noften to observe such animals, plants, or other things as Nature at\\ntimes creates out of caprice, or by chance; in which he found a\\npleasure and satisfaction that drove him quite out of his mind with\\ndelight; and he spoke of them so often in his discourse, that at\\ntimes, although he found pleasure in them, it became wearisome to\\nothers. He would sometimes stop to gaze at a wall against which sick\\npeople had been for a long time discharging their spittle, and from\\nthis he would picture to himself battles of horsemen, and the most\\nfantastic cities and widest landscapes that were ever seen; and he\\ndid the same with the clouds in the sky.\\n\\nHe gave his attention to colouring in oils, having seen some works\\nof Leonardo\\'s, executed with that gradation of colour, and finished\\nwith that extraordinary diligence, which Leonardo used to employ\\nwhen he wished to display his art. And so Piero, being pleased with\\nhis method, sought to imitate it, although he was afterwards very\\ndistant from Leonardo, and worlds away from any other manner. It may\\nbe said, in truth, that he changed his manner almost for every work\\nthat he executed.\\n\\nIf Piero had not been so solitary, and had taken more care of\\nhimself in his way of living than he did, he would have made known\\nthe greatness of his intellect in such a way that he would have been\\nrevered, whereas, by reason of his uncouth ways, he was rather held\\nto be a madman, although in the end he did no harm save to himself\\nalone, while his works were beneficial and useful to his art. For\\nwhich reason every good intellect and every excellent craftsman\\nshould always be taught, from such an example, to keep his eyes on\\nthe end of life.\\n\\nNor will I refrain from saying that Piero, in his youth, being\\nfanciful and extravagant in invention, was much employed for the\\nmasquerades that are held during the Carnival; and he became very\\ndear to the young noblemen of Florence, having improved their\\nfestivals much in invention, adornment, grandeur, and pomp. As to\\nthat kind of pastime, it is said that he was one of the first to\\ncontrive to marshal them in the form of triumphal processions; at\\nleast, he improved them greatly, by accompanying the invention of\\nthe story represented, not only with music and with words suited to\\nthe subject, but also with a train of incredible pomp, formed of\\nmen on foot and on horseback, with habits and ornaments in keeping\\nwith the story; which produced a very rich and beautiful effect, and\\nhad in it something both grand and ingenious. And it was certainly a\\nvery beautiful thing to see, by night, twenty-five or thirty pairs\\nof horses, most richly caparisoned, with their riders in costume,\\naccording to the subject of the invention, and six or eight grooms\\nto each rider, with torches in their hands, and all clothed in one\\nand the same livery, sometimes more than four hundred in number; and\\nthen the chariot, or triumphal car, covered with ornaments,\\ntrophies, and most bizarre things of fancy; altogether, a thing\\nwhich makes men\\'s intellects more subtle, and gives great pleasure\\nand satisfaction to the people.\\n\\n\\n\\nAmong these spectacles, which were numerous and ingenious, it is my\\npleasure to give a brief description of one, which was contrived\\nmostly by Piero, when he was already of a mature age, and which was\\nnot, like many, pleasing through its beauty, but, on the contrary,\\non account of a strange, horrible, and unexpected invention, gave no\\nlittle satisfaction to the people: for even as in the matter of food\\nbitter things sometimes give marvellous delight to the human palate,\\nso do horrible things in such pastimes, if only they be carried out\\nwith judgment and art; which is evident in the representation of\\ntragedies. This was the Car of Death, wrought by him with the\\ngreatest secrecy in the Sala del Papa, so that nothing could ever be\\nfound out about it, until it was seen and known at one and the same\\nmoment. This triumphal chariot was an enormous car drawn by\\nbuffaloes, black all over and painted with skeletons and white\\ncrosses; and upon the highest point of the car stood a colossal\\nfigure of Death, scythe in hand, and right round the car were a\\nnumber of covered tombs; and at all the places where the procession\\nhalted for the chanting of dirges, these tombs opened, and from them\\nissued figures draped in black cloth, upon which were painted all\\nthe bones of a skeleton, over their arms, breasts, flanks, and legs;\\nwhich, what with the white over the black, and the appearing in the\\ndistance of some figures carrying torches, with masks that\\nrepresented a death\\'s head both in front and behind, as well as the\\nneck, not only gave an appearance of the greatest reality, but was\\nalso horrible and terrifying to behold. And these figures of the\\ndead, at the sound of certain muffled trumpets, low and mournful in\\ntone, came half out of their tombs, and, seating themselves upon\\nthem, sang to music full of melancholy that song so celebrated at\\nthe present day: \"Dolor, pianto, e penitenzia.\" Before and after the\\ncar came a great number of the dead, riding on certain horses picked\\nout with the greatest diligence from among the leanest and most\\nmeagre that could be found, with black caparisons covered with white\\ncrosses; and each had four grooms draped in the garb of death, with\\nblack torches, and a large black standard with crosses, bones, and\\ndeath\\'s heads. After the car were trailed ten black standards; and\\nas they walked, the whole company sang in unison, with trembling\\nvoices, that Psalm of David that is called the Miserere.\\n\\nThis dread spectacle, through its novelty and terror, as I have\\nsaid, filled the whole city with fear and marvel together; and\\nalthough at the first sight it did not seem suited to a Carnival,\\nnevertheless, being new and very well arranged, it pleased the minds\\nof all, and Piero, the creator and inventor of the whole, gained\\nconsummate praise and commendation for it; and it was the reason\\nthat afterwards, going from one thing to another, men continued to\\ncontrive lively and ingenious inventions, so that in truth, for such\\nrepresentations and for holding similar festivals, this city has\\nnever had an equal. And in those old men who saw it there still\\nremains a vivid memory of it, nor are they ever weary of celebrating\\nthis fantastic invention. I have heard from the lips of Andrea di\\nCosimo, who helped him to carry out the work, and of Andrea del\\nSarto, who was Piero\\'s disciple, and who also had a hand in it, that\\nit was a common opinion at that time that this invention was\\nintended to foreshadow the return of the Medici family to Florence\\nin the year 1512, since at the time when the procession was held\\nthey were exiles, and, so to speak, dead, but destined in a short\\ntime to come to life; and in this sense were interpreted the\\nfollowing words in the song--\\n\\n  Morti siam come vedete,\\n  Così morti vedrem voi;\\n  Fummo già come voi siete,\\n  Voi sarete come noi, etc.\\n\\nwhereby men wished to signify the return of that family (a\\nresurrection, as it were, from death to life), and the expulsion and\\nabasement of their enemies; or it may have been that many gave it\\nthat significance from the subsequent fact of the return of that\\nillustrious house to Florence--so prone is the human intellect to\\napplying every word and act that has come previously, to the events\\nthat happen afterwards. Certain it is that this was the opinion of\\nmany at that time; and it was much spoken of.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut to return to the art and actions of Piero; he was given the\\ncommission for a panel in the Church of the Servite Friars, in the\\nChapel of the Tedaldi, where they keep the garment and the pillow of\\nS. Filippo, a brother of their Order; wherein he depicted Our Lady\\nstanding, raised from the ground on a pedestal, and uplifting her\\nhead towards Heaven, with a book in her hand, but without her Son;\\nand above her is the Holy Spirit, bathing her with light. Nor did he\\nwish that any other light than that of the Dove should illumine her\\nand the figures that are round her, such as a S. Margaret and a S.\\nCatherine, who are on their knees, adoring her, while S. Peter and\\nS. John the Evangelist are standing, contemplating her, together\\nwith S. Filippo, the Servite Friar, and S. Antonino, Archbishop of\\nFlorence. Moreover, he made there a landscape that is very bizarre,\\nwhat with the strange trees and certain grottoes. And in truth,\\nthere are some very beautiful things in this work, such as certain\\nheads that reveal both draughtsmanship and grace; besides the\\ncolouring, which is very harmonious, for it is certain that Piero\\nwas a great master of colouring in oils. In the predella he painted\\nsome little scenes, very well executed; and, among others, there is\\none of S. Margaret issuing from the belly of the Dragon, wherein he\\nmade that animal so monstrous and hideous, that I do not think that\\nthere is anything better of that kind to be seen, for with its eyes\\nit reveals venom, fire, and death, in an aspect truly terrifying.\\nAnd certainly, as for such things, I do not believe that any one\\never did them better than he, or came near him in imagining them; to\\nwhich witness is borne by a marine monster that he made and\\npresented to the Magnificent Giuliano de\\' Medici, which is so\\nextravagant, bizarre, and fantastic in its deformity, that it seems\\nimpossible that Nature should produce anything so deformed and\\nstrange among her creations. This monster is now in the guardaroba\\nof Duke Cosimo de\\' Medici, as is also a book, likewise by the hand\\nof Piero, of animals of the same kind, most beautiful and bizarre,\\nhatched very diligently with the pen, and finished with an\\nincredible patience; which book was presented to him by M. Cosimo\\nBartoli, Provost of S. Giovanni, who is very much my friend, as he\\nis of all our craftsmen, being a man who has always delighted, and\\nstill delights, in our profession.\\n\\nHe also executed, round a chamber in the house of Francesco del\\nPugliese, various scenes with little figures; nor is it possible to\\ndescribe the different fantastic things that he delighted to paint\\nin all those scenes, what with the buildings, the animals, the\\ncostumes, the various instruments, and any other fanciful things\\nthat came into his head, since the stories were drawn from fables.\\nThese scenes, after the death of Francesco del Pugliese and his\\nsons, were taken away, nor do I know what has become of them; and\\nthe same thing has happened to a picture of Mars and Venus, with her\\nLoves and Vulcan, executed with great art and with an incredible\\npatience.\\n\\nPiero painted, for the elder Filippo Strozzi, a picture with little\\nfigures of Perseus delivering Andromeda from the Monster, in which\\nare some very beautiful things. It is now in the house of Signor\\nSforza Almeni, First Chamberlain to Duke Cosimo, having been\\npresented to him by Messer Giovanni Battista, the son of Lorenzo\\nStrozzi, who knew how much that nobleman delighted in painting and\\nsculpture; and he holds it in great account, for Piero never made a\\nmore lovely or more highly finished picture than this one, seeing\\nthat it is not possible to find a more bizarre or more fantastic\\nsea-monster than that which Piero imagined and painted, or a fiercer\\nattitude than that of Perseus, who is raising his sword in the air\\nto smite the beast. In it, trembling between fear and hope,\\nAndromeda is seen bound, most beautiful in countenance; and in the\\nforeground are many people in various strange costumes, playing\\ninstruments and singing; among whom are some heads, smiling and\\nrejoicing at seeing the deliverance of Andromeda, that are divine.\\nThe landscape is very beautiful, and the colouring sweet and full of\\ngrace. In short, with regard to the harmony and gradation of the\\ncolours, he executed this work with the greatest possible diligence.\\n\\nHe painted, also, a picture containing a nude Venus, with a Mars,\\nlikewise nude, who is sleeping in a meadow full of flowers, and all\\naround are various Loves, who are carrying away, some here, some\\nthere, the helmet, armlets, and other pieces of armour of Mars;\\nthere is a grove of myrtle, with a Cupid that is afraid of a rabbit,\\nand there are also the Doves of Venus and the other emblems of Love.\\nThis picture is at Florence, in the house of Giorgio Vasari, who\\nkeeps it in memory of that master, whose caprices have always\\npleased him.\\n\\nThe Director of the Hospital of the Innocenti was much the friend of\\nPiero; and wishing to have a panel painted, which was to be placed\\nin the Pugliese Chapel, near the entrance into the church, on the\\nleft hand, he gave the commission for it to Piero, who brought it to\\ncompletion at his leisure; but first he reduced his patron to\\ndespair, for on no account would he let him see it until it was\\nfinished. How strange this seemed to the patron, both because of\\ntheir friendship, and because of his supplying Piero continually\\nwith money, without seeing what was being done, he himself showed,\\nwhen, on the occasion of the final payment, he refused to give it to\\nhim without seeing the work. But, on Piero threatening that he would\\ndestroy all that he had painted, he was forced to give him the rest,\\nand to wait patiently, in a greater rage than ever, for it to be set\\nin place. This picture contains much that is truly beautiful.\\n\\nHe undertook to paint a panel for a chapel in the Church of S. Piero\\nGattolini, and in this he represented Our Lady seated, with four\\nfigures round her, and two angels in the sky, who are crowning her;\\nwhich work, executed with such diligence that it brought him praise\\nand honour, is now to be seen in S. Friano, the other church having\\nbeen ruined. For the tramezzo of the Church of S. Francesco, at\\nFiesole, he painted a little panel-picture of the Conception, which\\nis a passing good little work, the figures being of no great size.\\nFor Giovanni Vespucci, who lived in a house now belonging to Piero\\nSalviati, opposite to S. Michele, in the Via de\\' Servi, he executed\\nsome bacchanalian scenes, which are round an apartment; wherein he\\nmade such strange fauns, satyrs, sylvan gods, little boys, and\\nbacchanals, that it is a marvel to see the diversity of the bay\\nhorses and garments, and the variety of the goatlike features, and\\nall with great grace and most vivid truth to nature. In one scene is\\nSilenus riding on an ass, with many children, some supporting him,\\nand some giving him drink; and throughout the whole is a feeling of\\nthe joy of life, produced by the great genius of Piero. And in\\ntruth, in all that there is to be seen by his hand, one recognizes a\\nspirit very different and far distant from that of other painters,\\nand a certain subtlety in the investigation of some of the deepest\\nand most subtle secrets of Nature, without grudging time or labour,\\nbut only for his own delight and for his pleasure in the art. And it\\ncould not well be otherwise; since, having grown enamoured of her,\\nhe cared nothing for his own comfort, and reduced himself to eating\\nnothing but boiled eggs, which, in order to save firing, he cooked\\nwhen he was boiling his glue, and not six or eight at a time, but in\\nfifties; and, keeping them in a basket, he would eat them one by\\none. In this life he found such peculiar pleasure that any other, in\\ncomparison with his own, seemed to him slavery. He could not bear\\nthe crying of children, the coughing of men, the sound of bells, and\\nthe chanting of friars; and when the rain was pouring in torrents\\nfrom the sky, it pleased him to see it streaming straight down from\\nthe roofs and splashing on the ground. He had the greatest terror of\\nlightning; and, when he heard very loud thunder, he wrapped himself\\nin his mantle, and, having closed the windows and the door of the\\nroom, he crouched in a corner until the storm should pass. He was\\nvery varied and original in his discourse, and sometimes said such\\nbeautiful things, that he made his hearers burst with laughter. But\\nwhen he was old, and near the age of eighty, he had become so\\nstrange and eccentric that nothing could be done with him. He would\\nnot have assistants standing round him, so that his misanthropy had\\nrobbed him of all possible aid. He was sometimes seized by a desire\\nto work, but was not able, by reason of the palsy, and fell into\\nsuch a rage that he tried to force his hands to labour; but, as he\\nmuttered to himself, the mahlstick fell from his grasp, and even his\\nbrushes, so that it was pitiable to behold. Flies enraged him, and\\neven shadows annoyed him. And so, having become ill through old age,\\nhe was visited by one or two friends, who besought him to make his\\npeace with God; but he would not believe that he was dying, and put\\nthem off from one day to another; not that he was hard of heart, or\\nan unbeliever, for he was a most zealous Christian, although his\\nlife was that of a beast. He discoursed at times on the torments of\\nthose ills that destroy men\\'s bodies, and of the suffering endured\\nby those who come to die with their strength wasting away little by\\nlittle, which he called a great affliction. He spoke evil of\\nphysicians, apothecaries, and those who nurse the sick, saying that\\nthey cause them to die of hunger; besides the tortures of syrups,\\nmedicines, clysters, and other martyrdoms, such as not being allowed\\nto sleep when you are drowsy, making your will, seeing your\\nrelatives round you, and staying in a dark room. He praised death by\\nthe hand of justice, saying that it was a fine thing to go to your\\ndeath in that way; to see the broad sky about you, and all that\\nthrong; to be comforted with sweetmeats and with kind words; to have\\nthe priest and the people praying for you; and to go into Paradise\\nwith the Angels; so that whoever departed from this life at one\\nblow, was very fortunate. And as he discoursed, he would twist\\neverything to the strangest meanings that were ever heard.\\nWherefore, living in such strange fashion, he reduced himself to\\nsuch a state with his extravagant fancies, that one morning he was\\nfound dead at the foot of a staircase, in the year 1521; and he was\\ngiven burial in S. Piero Maggiore.\\n\\nHis disciples were many, and one among them was Andrea del Sarto,\\nwho was a host in himself. Piero\\'s portrait I received from\\nFrancesco da San Gallo, who was much his friend and intimate\\ncompanion, and who made it when Piero was old; which Francesco still\\nhas a work by the hand of Piero that I must not pass by, a very\\nbeautiful head of Cleopatra, with an asp wound round her neck, and\\ntwo portraits, one of his father Giuliano, and the other of his\\ngrandfather Francesco Giamberti, which seem to be alive.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBRAMANTE DA URBINO\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " ' OF BRAMANTE DA URBINO\\n\\nARCHITECT\\n\\n\\nOf very great advantage to architecture, in truth, was the new\\nmethod of Filippo Brunelleschi, who imitated and restored to the\\nlight, after many ages, the noble works of the most learned and\\nmarvellous ancients. But no less useful to our age was Bramante, in\\nfollowing the footsteps of Filippo, and making the path of his\\nprofession of architecture secure for all who came after him, by\\nmeans of his courage, boldness, intellect, and science in that art,\\nwherein he had the mastery not of theory only, but of supreme skill\\nand practice. Nor could nature have created a more vigorous\\nintellect, or one to exercise his art and carry it into execution\\nwith greater invention and proportion, or with a more thorough\\nknowledge, than Bramante. But no less essential than all this was\\nthe election to the Pontificate, at that time, of Julius II, a Pope\\nof great spirit, full of desire to leave memorials behind him. And\\nit was fortunate both for us and for Bramante that he found such a\\nPrince (a thing which rarely happens to men of great genius), at\\nwhose expense he might be able to display the worth of his\\nintellect, and that mastery over difficulties which he showed in\\narchitecture. His ability was so universal in the buildings that he\\nerected, that the outlines of the cornices, the shafts of the\\ncolumns, the graceful capitals, the bases, the consoles and corners,\\nthe vaults, the staircases, the projections, and every detail of\\nevery Order of architecture, contrived from the counsel or model of\\nthis craftsman, never failed to astonish all who saw them. Wherefore\\nit appears to me that the everlasting gratitude which is due to the\\nancients from the intellects that study their works, is also due\\nfrom them to the labours of Bramante; for if the Greeks were the\\ninventors of architecture, and the Romans their imitators, Bramante\\nnot only imitated what he saw, with new invention, and taught it to\\nus, but also added very great beauty and elaboration to the art,\\nwhich we see embellished by him at the present day.\\n\\nHe was born at Castel Durante, in the State of Urbino, of poor but\\nhonest parentage. In his boyhood, besides reading and writing, he\\ngave much attention to arithmetic; but his father, who had need that\\nhe should earn money, perceiving that he delighted much in drawing,\\napplied him, when still a mere boy, to the art of painting;\\nwhereupon Bramante gave much study to the works of Fra Bartolommeo,\\notherwise called Fra Carnovale da Urbino, who painted the\\npanel-picture of S. Maria della Bella at Urbino. But since he always\\ndelighted in architecture and perspective, he departed from Castel\\nDurante, and made his way to Lombardy, where he went now to one\\ncity, and now to another, working as best he could, but not on\\nthings of great cost or much credit, having as yet neither name nor\\nreputation. For this reason he determined at least to see some\\nnoteworthy work, and betook himself to Milan, in order to see the\\nDuomo. In that city there was then living one Cesare Cesariano,\\nreputed to be a good geometrician and an able architect, who wrote a\\ncommentary on Vitruvius, and, out of despair at not having received\\nfor this the remuneration that he had expected, became so strange\\nthat he would work no more; and, having grown almost savage, he died\\nmore like a beast than like a human being. There was also one\\nBernardino da Trevio, a Milanese, engineer and architect for the\\nDuomo, and an excellent draughtsman, who was held by Leonardo da\\nVinci to be a rare master, although his manner was rather crude and\\nsomewhat hard in painting. By his hand is a Resurrection of Christ\\nto be seen at the upper end of the cloister of the Grazie, with some\\nvery beautiful foreshortenings; and a chapel in fresco in S.\\nFrancesco, containing the deaths of S. Peter and S. Paul. He painted\\nmany other works in Milan, and he also made a good number in the\\nsurrounding district, which are held in esteem; and in our book\\nthere is a head of a very beautiful woman, in charcoal and\\nlead-white, which still bears witness to the manner that he\\nfollowed.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut to return to Bramante; having studied that building, and having\\ncome to know those engineers, he so took courage, that he resolved\\nto devote himself wholly to architecture. Having therefore departed\\nfrom Milan, he betook himself, just before the holy year of 1500, to\\nRome, where he was recognized by some friends, both from his own\\ncountry and from Lombardy, and received a commission to paint, over\\nthe Porta Santa of S. Giovanni Laterano, which is opened for the\\nJubilee, the coat of arms of Pope Alexander VI, to be executed in\\nfresco, with angels and other figures acting as supporters.\\n\\nBramante had brought some money from Lombardy, and he earned some\\nmore in Rome by executing certain works; and this he spent with the\\ngreatest economy, since he wished to be able to live independently,\\nand at the same time, without having to work, to be free to take\\nmeasurements, at his ease, of all the ancient buildings in Rome. And\\nhaving put his hand to this, he set out, alone with his thoughts;\\nand within no great space of time he had measured all the buildings\\nin that city and in the Campagna without; and he went as far as\\nNaples, and wherever he knew that there were antiquities. He\\nmeasured all that was at Tivoli and in the Villa of Hadrian, and, as\\nwill be related afterwards in the proper place, made great use of\\nit. The mind of Bramante becoming known in this way, the Cardinal of\\nNaples, having noticed him, began to favour him. Whereupon, while\\nBramante was continuing his studies, the desire came to the said\\nCardinal to have the cloister of the Frati della Pace rebuilt in\\ntravertine, and he gave the charge of this cloister to Bramante, and\\nhe, desiring to earn money and to gain the good will of that\\nCardinal, set himself to work with all possible industry and\\ndiligence, and brought it quickly to perfect completion. And\\nalthough it was not a work of perfect beauty, it gave him a very\\ngreat name, since there were not many in Rome who followed the\\nprofession of architecture with such zeal, study, and resolution as\\nBramante.\\n\\nAt the beginning he served as under-architect to Pope Alexander VI\\nfor the fountain of Trastevere, and likewise for that which was made\\non the Piazza di S. Pietro. He also took part, together with other\\nexcellent architects, when his reputation had increased, in the\\nplanning of a great part of the Palace of S. Giorgio, and of the\\nChurch of S. Lorenzo in Damaso, at the commission of Raffaello\\nRiario, Cardinal of S. Giorgio, near the Campo di Fiore; which\\npalace, whatever better work may have been executed afterwards,\\nnevertheless was and still is held, on account of its greatness, to\\nbe a commodious and magnificent habitation; and the building of this\\nedifice was carried out by one Antonio Montecavallo. Bramante was\\nconsulted with regard to the enlargement of S. Jacopo degli\\nSpagnuoli, on the Piazza Navona, and likewise in the deliberations\\nfor the building of S. Maria de Anima, which was afterwards carried\\nout by a German architect. From his design, also, was the Palace of\\nCardinal Adriano da Corneto in the Borgo Nuovo, which was built\\nslowly, and then finally remained unfinished by reason of the flight\\nof that Cardinal; and in like manner, the enlargement of the\\nprincipal chapel of S. Maria del Popolo was executed from his\\ndesign.\\n\\nThese works brought him so much credit in Rome, that he was\\nconsidered the best architect, in that he was resolute, prompt, and\\nmost fertile in invention; and he was continually employed by all\\nthe great persons in that city for their most important\\nundertakings. Wherefore, after Julius II had been elected Pope, in\\nthe year 1503, he entered into his service. The fancy had taken that\\nPontiff to so transform the space that lay between the Belvedere and\\nthe Papal Palace, as to give it the aspect of a square theatre,\\nembracing a little valley that ran between the old Papal Palace and\\nthe new buildings that Innocent VIII had erected as a habitation for\\nthe Popes; and he intended, by means of two corridors, one on either\\nside of this little valley, to make it possible to go from the\\nBelvedere to the Palace under loggie, and also to go from the Palace\\nto the Belvedere in the same way, and likewise, by means of various\\nflights of steps, to ascend to the level of the Belvedere. Whereupon\\nBramante, who had very good judgment and an inventive genius in such\\nmatters, distributed two ranges of columns along the lowest part;\\nfirst, a very beautiful Doric loggia, similar to the Colosseum of\\nthe Savelli (although, in place of half-columns, he used pilasters),\\nand all built of travertine; and over this a second range of the\\nIonic Order, full of windows, of such a height as to come to the\\nlevel of the first-floor rooms of the Papal Palace, and to the\\nlevel of those of the Belvedere; intending to make, afterwards, a\\nloggia more than four hundred paces long on the side towards Rome,\\nand likewise another on the side towards the wood, with which, one\\non either hand, he proposed to enclose the valley; into which, after\\nit had been levelled, was to be brought all the water from the\\nBelvedere; and for this a very beautiful fountain was to be made. Of\\nthis design, Bramante finished the first corridor, which issues from\\nthe Palace and leads to the Belvedere on the side towards Rome,\\nexcept the upper loggia, which was to go above it. As for the\\nopposite part, on the side towards the wood, the foundations,\\nindeed, were laid, but it could not be finished, being interrupted\\nby the death of Julius, and then by that of Bramante. His design was\\nheld to be so beautiful in invention, that it was believed that from\\nthe time of the ancients until that day, Rome had seen nothing\\nbetter. But of the other corridor, as has been said, he left only\\nthe foundations, and the labour of finishing it has dragged on down\\nto our own day, when Pius IV has brought it almost to completion.\\n\\nBramante also erected the head-wall of the Museum of ancient statues\\nin the Belvedere, together with the range of niches; wherein were\\nplaced, in his lifetime, the Laocoon, one of the rarest of ancient\\nstatues, the Apollo, and the Venus; and the rest of the statues were\\nset up there afterwards by Leo X, such as the Tiber, the Nile, and\\nthe Cleopatra, with some others added by Clement VII; and in the\\ntime of Paul III and Julius III many important improvements were\\nmade, at great expense.\\n\\nBut to return to Bramante; he was very resolute, although he was\\nhindered by the avarice of those who supplied him with the means to\\nwork, and he had a marvellous knowledge of the craft of building.\\nThis construction at the Belvedere was executed by him with\\nextraordinary speed, and such was his eagerness as he worked, and\\nthat of the Pope, who would have liked to see the edifice spring up\\nfrom the ground, without needing to be built, that the builders of\\nthe foundations brought the sand and the solid foundation-clay by\\nnight and let it down by day in the presence of Bramante, who\\ncaused the foundations to be made without seeing anything more of\\nthe work. This inadvertence was the reason that all his buildings\\nhave cracked, and are in danger of falling down, as did this same\\ncorridor, of which a piece eighty braccia in length fell to the\\nground in the time of Clement VII, and was afterwards rebuilt by\\nPope Paul III, who also had the foundations restored and the whole\\nstrengthened.\\n\\nFrom his design, also, are many flights of steps in the Belvedere,\\nvaried according to their situations, whether high or low, in the\\nDoric, Ionic, and Corinthian Orders--a very beautiful work, executed\\nwith extraordinary grace. And he had made a model for the whole,\\nwhich is said to have been a marvellous thing, as may still be\\nimagined from the beginning of the work, unfinished as it is.\\nMoreover, he made a spiral staircase upon mounting columns, in such\\na way that one can ascend it on horseback; wherein the Doric passes\\ninto the Ionic, and the Ionic into the Corinthian, rising from one\\ninto the other; a work executed with supreme grace, and with truly\\nexcellent art, which does him no less honour than any other thing by\\nhis hand that is therein. This invention was copied by Bramante from\\nS. Niccolò at Pisa, as was said in the Lives of Giovanni and Niccola\\nof Pisa.\\n\\nThe fancy took Bramante to make, in a frieze on the outer façade of\\nthe Belvedere, some letters after the manner of ancient\\nhieroglyphics, representing the name of the Pope and his own, in\\norder to show his ingenuity: and he had begun thus, \"Julio II, Pont.\\nMassimo,\" having caused a head in profile of Julius Cæsar to be\\nmade, and a bridge, with two arches, which signified, \"Julio II,\\nPont.,\" and an obelisk from the Circus Maximus, to represent \"Max.\"\\nAt which the Pope laughed, and caused him to make the letters in the\\nancient manner, one braccio in height, which are there at the\\npresent day; saying that he had copied this folly from a door at\\nViterbo, over which one Maestro Francesco, an architect, had placed\\nhis name, carved in the architrave, and represented by a S. Francis\\n(S. Francesco), an arch (arco), a roof (tetto), and a tower (torre),\\nwhich, interpreted in his own way, denoted, \"Maestro Francesco\\nArchitettore.\" The Pope, on account of his ability in architecture,\\nwas very well disposed towards him.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor these reasons he was rightly held worthy by the aforesaid Pope,\\nwho loved him very dearly for his great gifts, to be appointed to\\nthe Office of the Piombo, for which he made a machine for printing\\nBulls, with a very beautiful screw. In the service of that Pontiff\\nBramante went to Bologna, in the year 1504, when that city returned\\nto the Church; and he occupied himself, throughout the whole war\\nagainst Mirandola, on many ingenious things of the greatest\\nimportance. He made many designs for ground-plans and complete\\nbuildings, which he drew very well; and of such there are some to be\\nseen in our book, accurately drawn and executed with very great art.\\nHe taught many of the rules of architecture to Raffaello da Urbino;\\ndesigning for him, for example, the buildings that Raffaello\\nafterwards drew in perspective in that apartment of the Pope wherein\\nthere is Mount Parnassus; in which apartment he made a portrait of\\nBramante taking measurements with a pair of compasses.\\n\\nThe Pope resolved, having had the Strada Julia straightened out by\\nBramante, to place in it all the public offices and tribunals of\\nRome, on account of the convenience which this would bring to the\\nmerchants in their business, which up to that time had always been\\nmuch hindered. Wherefore Bramante made a beginning with the palace\\nthat is to be seen by S. Biagio sul Tevere, wherein there is still\\nan unfinished Corinthian temple, a thing of rare excellence. The\\nrest of this beginning is in rustic work, and most beautiful; and it\\nis a great pity that a work so honourable, useful, and magnificent,\\nwhich is held by the masters of the profession to be the most\\nbeautiful example of design in that kind that has ever been seen,\\nshould not have been finished. He made, also, in the first cloister\\nof S. Pietro a Montorio, a round temple of travertine, than which\\nnothing more shapely or better conceived, whether in proportion,\\ndesign, variety, or grace, could be imagined; and even more\\nbeautiful would it have been, if the whole extent of the cloister,\\nwhich is not finished, had been brought to the form that is to be\\nseen in a drawing by his hand. He directed the building, in the\\nBorgo, of the palace which afterwards belonged to Raffaello da\\nUrbino, executed with bricks and mould-castings, the columns and\\nbosses being of the Doric Order and of rustic work--a very\\nbeautiful work--with a new invention in the making of these\\ncastings. He also made the design and preparations for the\\ndecoration of S. Maria at Loreto, which was afterwards continued by\\nAndrea Sansovino; and an endless number of models for palaces and\\ntemples, which are in Rome and throughout the States of the Church.\\n\\nSo sublime was the intellect of this marvellous craftsman, that he\\nmade a vast design for restoring and rearranging the Papal Palace.\\nAnd so greatly had his courage grown, on seeing the powers and\\ndesires of the Pope rise to the level of his own wishes and genius,\\nthat, hearing that he was minded to throw the Church of S. Pietro to\\nthe ground, in order to build it anew, he made him an endless number\\nof designs. And among those that he made was one that was very\\nwonderful, wherein he showed the greatest possible judgment, with\\ntwo bell-towers, one on either side of the façade, as we see it in\\nthe coins afterwards struck for Julius II and Leo X by Caradosso, a\\nmost excellent goldsmith, who had no peer in making dies, as may\\nstill be seen from the medal of Bramante, executed by him, which is\\nvery beautiful. And so, the Pope having resolved to make a beginning\\nwith the vast and sublime structure of S. Pietro, Bramante caused\\nhalf of the old church to be pulled down, and put his hand to the\\nwork, with the intention that it should surpass, in beauty, art,\\ninvention, and design, as well as in grandeur, richness, and\\nadornment, all the buildings that had been erected in that city by\\nthe power of the Commonwealth, and by the art and intellect of so\\nmany able masters; and with his usual promptness he laid the\\nfoundations, and carried the greater part of the building, before\\nthe death of the Pope and his own, to the height of the cornice,\\nwhere are the arches to all the four piers; and these he turned with\\nsupreme expedition and art. He also executed the vaulting of the\\nprincipal chapel, where the recess is, giving his attention at the\\nsame time to pressing on the building of the chapel that is called\\nthe Chapel of the King of France.\\n\\nFor this work he invented the method of casting vaults in wooden\\nmoulds, in such a manner that patterns of friezes and foliage, like\\ncarvings, come out in the plaster; and in the arches of this edifice\\nhe showed how they could be turned with flying scaffoldings, a\\nmethod that we have since seen followed by Antonio da San Gallo. In\\nthe part that was finished by him, the cornice that runs right round\\nthe interior is seen to be so graceful, that no other man\\'s hand\\ncould take away or alter anything from its design without spoiling\\nit. It is evident from his capitals, which are of olive leaves\\nwithin, and from all the Doric work on the outer side, which is\\nextraordinarily beautiful, how sublime was the courage of Bramante,\\nwhereby, in truth, if he had possessed physical powers equal to the\\nintellect that adorned his spirit, he would most certainly have\\nachieved even more unexampled things than he did. This work, as will\\nbe related in the proper places, since his death and down to the\\npresent day, has been much mutilated by other architects, insomuch\\nthat it may be said that with the exception of four arches which\\nsupport the tribune, nothing of his has remained there. For\\nRaffaello da Urbino and Giuliano da San Gallo, who carried on the\\nwork after the death of Julius II, together with Fra Giocondo of\\nVerona, thought fit to begin to alter it; and after the death of\\nthose masters, Baldassarre Peruzzi, in building the Chapel of the\\nKing of France, in the transept on the side towards the Campo Santo,\\nchanged Bramante\\'s design; and under Paul III Antonio da San Gallo\\nchanged it again entirely. Finally, Michelagnolo Buonarroti,\\nsweeping away the countless opinions and superfluous expenses, has\\nbrought it to such beauty and perfection as not one of those others\\never thought of, which all comes from his judgment and power of\\ndesign; although he said to me several times that he was only the\\nexecutor of the design and arrangements of Bramante, seeing that he\\nwho originally lays the foundations of a great edifice is its true\\ncreator. Vast, indeed, seemed the conception of Bramante in this\\nwork, and he gave it a very great beginning, which, even if he had\\nbegun on a smaller scale, neither San Gallo nor the others, nor even\\nBuonarroti, would have had enough power of design to increase,\\nalthough they were able to diminish it; so immense, stupendous, and\\nmagnificent was this edifice, and yet Bramante had conceived\\nsomething even greater.\\n\\nIt is said that he was so eager to see this structure making\\nprogress, that he pulled down many beautiful things in S. Pietro,\\nsuch as tombs of Popes, paintings, and mosaics, and that for this\\nreason we have lost all trace of many portraits of distinguished\\npersons, which were scattered throughout that church, which was the\\nprincipal church of all Christendom. He preserved only the altar of\\nS. Pietro, and the old tribune, round which he made a most beautiful\\nornament of the Doric Order, all of peperino-stone, to the end that\\nwhen the Pope came to S. Pietro to say Mass, he might be able to\\nstand within it with all his Court and with the Ambassadors of the\\nChristian Princes; but death prevented him from finishing it\\nentirely, and the Sienese Baldassarre afterwards brought it to\\ncompletion.\\n\\nBramante was a very merry and pleasant person, ever delighting to\\nhelp his neighbour. He was very much the friend of men of ability,\\nand favoured them in whatever way he could; as may be seen from his\\nkindness to the gracious Raffaello da Urbino, most celebrated of\\npainters, whom he brought to Rome. He always lived in the greatest\\nsplendour, doing honour to himself; and in the rank to which his\\nmerits had raised him, what he possessed was nothing to what he\\nwould have been able to spend. He delighted in poetry, and loved to\\nimprovise upon the lyre, or to hear others doing this: and he\\ncomposed some sonnets, if not as polished as we now demand them, at\\nleast weighty and without faults. He was much esteemed by the\\nprelates, and was received by an endless number of noblemen who made\\nhis acquaintance. In his lifetime he had very great renown, and even\\ngreater after his death, because of which the building of S. Pietro\\nwas interrupted for many years. He lived to the age of seventy, and\\nhe was borne to his tomb in Rome, with most honourable obsequies, by\\nthe Court of the Pope and by all the sculptors, architects, and\\npainters. He was buried in S. Pietro, in the year 1514.\\n\\n\\n\\nVery great was the loss that architecture suffered in the death of\\nBramante, who was the discoverer of many good methods wherewith he\\nenriched that art, such as the invention of casting vaults, and the\\nsecret of stucco; both of which were known to the ancients, but had\\nbeen lost until his time through the ruin of their buildings. And\\nthose who occupy themselves with measuring ancient works of\\narchitecture, find in the works of Bramante no less science and\\ndesign than in any of the former; wherefore, among those who are\\nversed in the profession, he can be accounted one of the rarest\\nintellects that have adorned our age. He left behind him an intimate\\nfriend, Giuliano Leno, who had much to do with the buildings of his\\ntime, but was employed rather to make preparations and to carry out\\nthe wishes of whoever designed them, than to work on his own\\naccount, although he had judgment and great experience.\\n\\nDuring his lifetime, Bramante employed in his works one Ventura, a\\ncarpenter of Pistoia, who was a man of very good ability, and drew\\npassing well. This Ventura, while in Rome, delighted much in taking\\nmeasurements of antiquities; and afterwards, wishing to live once\\nmore in his native place, he returned to Pistoia. Now it happened in\\nthat city, in the year 1509, that a Madonna, which is now called the\\nMadonna della Umiltà, worked miracles; and since many offerings were\\nbrought to her, the Signoria that was then governing the city\\ndetermined to build a temple in her honour. Whereupon Ventura,\\nconfronted with this opportunity, made with his own hand a model of\\nan octagonal temple ... braccia in breadth and ... braccia in\\nheight, with a vestibule or closed portico in front, very ornate\\nwithin and truly beautiful. This having given satisfaction to the\\nSignoria and to the chief men of the city, the building was begun\\naccording to the plans of Ventura, who, having laid the foundations\\nof the vestibule and the temple, completely finished the vestibule,\\nwhich he made very rich in pilasters and cornices of the Corinthian\\nOrder, with other carved stonework; while all the vaults in that\\nwork were made in like manner, with squares surrounded by mouldings,\\nalso in stone, and filled with rosettes. Afterwards, the octagonal\\ntemple was also carried to the height of the last cornice, from\\nwhich the vaulting of the tribune was to rise, during the lifetime\\nof Ventura; and since he was not very experienced in works of that\\nsize, he did not consider how the weight of the tribune might be\\nsafely laid on the building, but made within the thickness of the\\nwall, at the first range of windows, and at the second, where the\\nothers are, a passage that runs right round, whereby he contrived to\\nweaken the walls so much, that, the edifice being without buttresses\\nat the base, it was dangerous to raise a vault over it, and\\nparticularly on the angles at the corners, upon which all the weight\\nof the vault of that tribune must rest. Wherefore, after the death\\nof Ventura, there was no architect with courage enough to raise that\\nvault: nay, they had caused long and stout beams of timber to be\\nbrought to the place, in order to make a tent-shaped roof; but this\\ndid not please the citizens, and they would not have it put into\\nexecution. And so the building remained for many years without a\\nroof, until, in the year 1561, the Wardens of Works besought Duke\\nCosimo that his Excellency should so favour them as to cause that\\ntribune to be vaulted. Whereupon, in order to meet their wishes, the\\nDuke ordered Giorgio Vasari to go there and see whether he could\\nfind some method of vaulting it; and he, having done this, made a\\nmodel raising the building to the height of eight braccia above the\\ncornice that Ventura had left, in order to make buttresses for it;\\nand he decreased the breadth of the passage that runs right round\\nbetween the walls, and reinforced the building with buttresses,\\nbesides binding the corners and the parts below the passages that\\nVentura had made, between the windows, with stout keys of iron,\\ndouble at the angles; which secured the whole in such a manner that\\nthe vault could be raised with safety. Whereupon his Excellency was\\npleased to visit the place, and, being satisfied with everything,\\ngave orders for the work to be executed; and so all the buttresses\\nhave been built, and a beginning has already been made with the\\nraising of the cupola. Thus, then, the work of Ventura will become\\nricher, greater in size and adornment, and better in proportions;\\nbut he truly deserves to have record made of him, since that\\nbuilding is the most noteworthy modern work in the city of Pistoia.\\n\\n\\nFRA BARTOLOMMEO DI SAN MARCO\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " \" OF FRA BARTOLOMMEO DI SAN MARCO\\n\\n[_BACCIO DELLA PORTA_]\\n\\nPAINTER OF FLORENCE\\n\\n\\nNear the territory of Prato, which is ten miles distant from\\nFlorence, in a village called Savignano, was born Bartolommeo,\\nknown, according to the Tuscan custom, by the name of Baccio. He,\\nhaving shown in his childhood not merely inclination, but also\\naptitude, for drawing, was placed, through the good services of\\nBenedetto da Maiano, with Cosimo Rosselli, and lodged in the house\\nof some relatives of his own, who lived at the Porta a S. Piero\\nGattolini; where he stayed for many years, so that he was never\\ncalled or known by any other name than that of Baccio della Porta.\\n\\nAfter taking his leave of Cosimo Rosselli, he began to study with\\ngreat devotion the works of Leonardo da Vinci; and in a short time\\nhe made such proficience and such progress in colouring, that he\\nacquired the name and reputation of being one of the best young men\\nof his art, both in colouring and in drawing. He had a companion in\\nMariotto Albertinelli, who in a short time acquired his manner\\npassing well; and together with him he executed many pictures of Our\\nLady, which are scattered throughout Florence. To speak of all these\\nwould take too long, and I will mention only some excellently\\npainted by Baccio. There is one, containing a Madonna, in the house\\nof Filippo di Averardo Salviati, which is most beautiful, and which\\nhe holds very dear and in great price. Another was bought not long\\nsince, at a sale of old furniture, by Pier Maria delle Pozze, a\\nperson greatly devoted to pictures, who, having recognized its\\nbeauty, will not let it go for any sum of money; in which work is a\\nMadonna executed with extraordinary diligence. Piero del Pugliese\\nhad a little Madonna of marble, in very low relief, a very rare work\\nby the hand of Donatello, for which, in order to do it honour, he\\ncaused a wooden tabernacle to be made, with two little doors to\\nenclose it. This he gave to Baccio della Porta, who painted, on the\\ninner side of the doors, two little scenes, of which one was the\\nNativity of Christ, and the other His Circumcision; which Baccio\\nexecuted with little figures after the manner of miniatures, in such\\na way that it would not be possible to do better work in oils; and\\nthen he painted Our Lady receiving the Annunciation from the Angel,\\nin chiaroscuro, and likewise in oils, on the outer side of the same\\nlittle doors, so as to be seen when they are closed. This work is\\nnow in the study of Duke Cosimo, wherein he keeps all his little\\nantique figures of bronze, medals, and other rare pictures in\\nminiature; and it is treasured by his most illustrious Excellency as\\na rare thing, as indeed it is.\\n\\n\\n\\nBaccio was beloved in Florence for his virtues, for he was assiduous\\nin his work, quiet and good by nature, and a truly God-fearing man;\\nhe had a great liking for a life of peace, and he shunned vicious\\ncompany, delighted much in hearing sermons, and always sought the\\nsociety of learned and serious persons. And in truth, it is seldom\\nthat nature creates a man of good parts and a gentle craftsman,\\nwithout also providing him, after some time, with peace and favour,\\nas she did for Baccio, who, as will be told below, obtained all that\\nhe desired. The report having spread abroad that he was no less good\\nthan able, his fame so increased that he was commissioned by Gerozzo\\ndi Monna Venna Dini to paint the chapel wherein the bones of the\\ndead are kept, in the cemetery of the Hospital of S. Maria Nuova.\\nThere he began a Judgment in fresco, which he executed with such\\ndiligence and beauty of manner in the part which he finished, that\\nhe acquired extraordinary fame thereby, in addition to what he had\\nalready, and became greatly celebrated, on account of his having\\nrepresented with excellent conceptions the Glory of Paradise, and\\nChrist with the twelve Apostles judging the twelve Tribes, wherein\\nthe figures are soft in colouring and most beautifully draped.\\nMoreover, in those figures that are being dragged to Hell, in the\\npart that was designed but left unfinished, one sees the despair,\\ngrief, and shame of everlasting death, even as one perceives\\ncontentment and gladness in those that are being saved; although\\nthis work remained unfinished, since Baccio was inclined to give his\\nattention more to religion than to painting. For there was living in\\nS. Marco, at this time, Fra Girolamo Savonarola of Ferrara, of the\\nOrder of Preaching Friars, a very famous theologian; and Baccio,\\ngoing continually to hear his preaching, on account of the devotion\\nthat he felt for him, contracted a very strait intimacy with him,\\nand passed almost all his time in the convent, having also become\\nthe friend of the other friars. Now it happened that Fra Girolamo,\\ncontinuing his preaching, and crying out every day from the pulpit\\nthat lascivious pictures, music, and amorous books often lead the\\nmind to evil, became convinced that it was not right to keep in\\nhouses where there were young girls painted figures of naked men and\\nwomen. And at the next Carnival--when it was the custom in the city\\nto make little huts of faggots and other kinds of wood on the public\\nsquares, and on the Tuesday evening, according to ancient use, to\\nburn these, with amorous dances, in which men and women, joining\\nhands, danced round these fires, singing certain airs--the people\\nwere so inflamed by Fra Girolamo, and he wrought upon them so\\nstrongly with his words, that on that day they brought to the place\\na vast quantity of nude figures, both in painting and in sculpture,\\nmany by the hand of excellent masters, and likewise books, lutes,\\nand volumes of songs, which was a most grievous loss, particularly\\nfor painting. Thither Baccio carried all the drawings of nudes that\\nhe had made by way of studies, and he was followed by Lorenzo di\\nCredi and by many others, who had the name of Piagnoni. And it was\\nnot long before Baccio, on account of the affection that he bore to\\nFra Girolamo, made a very beautiful portrait of him in a picture,\\nwhich was then taken to Ferrara; but not long ago it came back to\\nFlorence, and it is now in the house of Filippo di Alamanno\\nSalviati, who, since it is by the hand of Baccio, holds it very\\ndear.\\n\\nIt happened, after this, that one day the opponents of Fra Girolamo\\nrose against him, in order to take him and deliver him over to the\\nhands of justice, on account of the disturbances that he had caused\\nin the city; and his friends, seeing this, also banded themselves\\ntogether, to the number of more than five hundred, and shut\\nthemselves up in S. Marco, and Baccio with them, on account of the\\ngreat affection that he had for their party. It is true that, being\\na person of little courage, nay, even timorous and mean-spirited,\\nand hearing an attack being made a little time after this on the\\nconvent, and men being wounded and killed, he began to have serious\\ndoubts about himself. For which reason he made a vow that if he were\\nto escape from that turmoil, he would straightway assume the habit\\nof that Order; which vow he carried out afterwards most faithfully,\\nfor when the uproar had ceased, and Fra Girolamo had been taken and\\ncondemned to death, as the writers of history relate with more\\ndetail, Baccio betook himself to Prato and became a monk in S.\\nDomenico, in that city, on July 26, in the year 1500, as is found\\nwritten in the chronicles of that same convent in which he assumed\\nthe habit; to the great displeasure of all his friends, who were\\ngrieved beyond measure at having lost him, and particularly because\\nthey heard that he had taken it into his head to forsake his\\npainting.\\n\\nWhereupon Mariotto Albertinelli, his friend and companion, at the\\nentreaties of Gerozzo Dini, took over the materials of Fra\\nBartolommeo--which was the name given by the Prior to Baccio, on\\ninvesting him with the habit--and brought to completion the work of\\nthe Ossa in S. Maria Nuova; where he portrayed from life the\\nDirector of the Hospital at that time, and some friars skilled in\\nsurgery, with Gerozzo, the patron of the work, and his wife,\\nfull-length figures on their knees, upon the walls on either side;\\nand in a nude figure that is seated, he portrayed Giuliano\\nBugiardini, his pupil, as a young man, with long locks according to\\nthe custom of that time, in which each separate hair might be\\ncounted, so carefully are they painted. He made there, likewise, his\\nown portrait, in the head, with long locks, of a figure that is\\nissuing from one of the tombs; and in that work, in the region of\\nthe blessed, there is also the portrait of Fra Giovanni da Fiesole,\\nthe painter, whose Life we have written. This painting was executed\\nwholly in fresco, both by Fra Bartolommeo and by Mariotto, so that\\nit has remained, and still remains, marvellously fresh, and is held\\nin esteem by craftsmen, since it is scarcely possible to do better\\nin that kind of work.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Fra Bartolommeo had been many months in Prato, he was sent by\\nhis superiors to take up his abode in S. Marco at Florence, and on\\naccount of his virtues he was received very warmly by the friars of\\nthat convent. In those days Bernardo del Bianco had caused to be\\nerected, in the Badia of Florence, a chapel of grey-stone, full of\\ncarving, and very rich and beautiful, from the design of Benedetto\\nda Rovezzano: which chapel was and still is much esteemed on account\\nof some ornamental work of great variety, wherein Benedetto Buglioni\\nplaced, in some niches, angels and other figures made of glazed\\nterra-cotta, in the round, to adorn it the more, with friezes\\ncontaining cherubs and the devices of Bianco. And Bernardo, wishing\\nto set up in the chapel a panel-picture that should be worthy of\\nthat adornment, and conceiving the idea that Fra Bartolommeo would\\nbe the right man for the work, sought in every possible way, through\\nthe intervention of his friends, to persuade him. Fra Bartolommeo\\nwas living in his convent, giving his attention to nothing save the\\ndivine offices and the duties of his Rule, although often besought\\nby the Prior and by his dearest friends that he should work again at\\nhis painting; and for more than four years he had refused to touch a\\nbrush. But on this occasion, being pressed by Bernardo del Bianco,\\nat length he began the panel-picture of S. Bernard, in which the\\nSaint is writing, and gazing with such deep contemplation at the\\nMadonna, with the Child in her arms, being borne by many angels and\\nchildren, all coloured with great delicacy, that there is clearly\\nperceived in him a certain celestial quality, I know not what, which\\nseems, to him who studies it with attention, to shine out over that\\nwork, into which Baccio put much diligence and love; not to mention\\nan arch executed in fresco, which is above it. He also made some\\npictures for Cardinal Giovanni de' Medici; and for Agnolo Doni he\\npainted a picture of Our Lady, which stands on the altar of a chapel\\nin his house--a work of extraordinary beauty.\\n\\nAt this time the painter Raffaello da Urbino came to Florence to\\nstudy his art, and taught the best principles of perspective to Fra\\nBartolommeo; and desiring to acquire the friar's manner of\\ncolouring, and being pleased with his handling of colours and his\\nmethod of harmonizing them, Raffaello was always in his company.\\nFra Bartolommeo painted about the same time, in S. Marco at\\nFlorence, a panel with an infinite number of figures, which is now\\nin the possession of the King of France, having been presented to\\nhim after being exposed to view for many months in S. Marco.\\nAfterwards, he painted another in that convent, containing an\\nendless number of figures, in place of the one that was sent into\\nFrance; in which picture are some children who are flying in the air\\nand holding open a canopy, executed with such good drawing and art,\\nand with such strong relief, that they appear to stand out from the\\npanel, while the colouring of the flesh reveals that beauty and\\nexcellence which every able craftsman seeks to give to his pictures;\\nand this work is still considered at the present day to be most\\nexcellent. In it are many figures surrounding a Madonna, all most\\nadmirable, and executed with grace, feeling, boldness, spirit, and\\nvivacity; and coloured, moreover, in so striking a manner, that they\\nseem to be in relief, since he wished to show that he was able not\\nonly to draw, but also to give his figures force and make them stand\\nout by means of the darkness of the shadows, as may be seen in some\\nchildren who are round a canopy, upholding it, who, as they fly\\nthrough the air, almost project from the panel. Besides this, there\\nis an Infant Christ who is marrying S. Catherine the Nun, than which\\nit would not be possible to paint anything more lifelike with the\\ndark colouring that he used. There is a circle of saints on one side\\ndiminishing in perspective, round the depth of a great recess, who\\nare distributed with such fine design that they seem to be real; and\\nthe same may be seen on the other side. And in truth, in this manner\\nof colouring, he imitated to a great extent the works of Leonardo;\\nparticularly in the darks, for which he used printer's smoke-black\\nand the black of burnt ivory. This panel has now become much darker\\nthan it was when he painted it, on account of those blacks, which\\nhave kept growing heavier and darker. In the foreground, among the\\nprincipal figures, he made a S. George in armour, who has a standard\\nin his hand, a bold, spirited, and vivacious figure, in a beautiful\\nattitude. There is also a S. Bartholomew, standing, a figure that\\ndeserves the highest praise; with two children who are playing, one\\non a lute, and the other on a lyre, one of whom he made with a leg\\ndrawn up and his instrument resting upon it, and with the hands\\ntouching the strings in the act of running over them, an ear intent\\non the harmony, the head upraised, and the mouth slightly open, in\\nsuch a way that whoever beholds him cannot persuade himself that he\\nshould not also hear the voice. No less lifelike is the other, who,\\nleaning on one side, and bending over with one ear to the lyre,\\nappears to be listening to learn how far it is in accord with the\\nsound of the lute and the voice, while, with his eyes fixed on the\\nground, and his ear turned intently towards his companion, who is\\nplaying and singing, he seeks to follow in harmony with the air.\\nThese conceptions and expressions are truly ingenious; the children,\\nwho are seated, and clothed in veiling, are marvellous and executed\\nwith great industry by the practised hand of Fra Bartolommeo; and\\nthe whole work is brought out into strong relief by a fine gradation\\nof dark shadows.\\n\\nA little time afterwards he painted another panel, to stand opposite\\nto the former, and containing a Madonna surrounded by some saints,\\nwhich is held to be a good work. He won extraordinary praise for\\nhaving introduced a method of blending the colouring of his figures\\nin such a way as to add a marvellous degree of harmony to art,\\nmaking them appear to be in relief and alive, and executing them\\nwith supreme perfection of manner.\\n\\nHearing much of the noble works made in Rome by Michelagnolo, and\\nlikewise those of the gracious Raffaello, and being roused by the\\nfame, which was continually reaching him, of the marvels wrought by\\nthose two divine craftsmen, with leave from his Prior he betook\\nhimself to Rome. There he was entertained by Fra Mariano Fetti,\\nFriar of the Piombo, for whom he painted two pictures of S. Peter\\nand S. Paul at his Convent of S. Silvestro a Monte Cavallo. But\\nsince he did not succeed in working as well in the air of Rome as he\\nhad done in that of Florence, while the vast number of works that he\\nsaw, what with the ancient and the modern, bewildered him so that\\nmuch of the ability and excellence that he believed himself to\\npossess, fell away from him, he determined to depart, leaving to\\nRaffaello the charge of finishing one of those pictures, that of S.\\nPeter, which he had not completed; which picture was retouched all\\nover by the hand of the marvellous Raffaello, and given to Fra\\nMariano.\\n\\nThus, then, Fra Bartolommeo returned to Florence. There he had been\\naccused many times of not knowing how to paint nudes; for which\\nreason he resolved to put himself to the test, and to show by means\\nof his labour that he was as well fitted as any other master for the\\nhighest achievements of his art. Whereupon, to prove this, he\\npainted a picture of S. Sebastian, naked, very lifelike in the\\ncolouring of the flesh, sweet in countenance, and likewise executed\\nwith corresponding beauty of person, whereby he won infinite praise\\nfrom the craftsmen. It is said that, while this figure was exposed\\nto view in the church, the friars found, through the confessional,\\nwomen who had sinned at the sight of it, on account of the charm and\\nmelting beauty of the lifelike reality imparted to it by the genius\\nof Fra Bartolommeo; for which reason they removed it from the church\\nand placed it in the chapter-house, where it did not remain long\\nbefore it was bought by Giovan Battista della Palla and sent to the\\nKing of France.\\n\\n\\n\\nFra Bartolommeo had fallen into a rage against the joiners who made\\nthe ornamental frames for his panels and pictures, for it was their\\ncustom, as it still is at the present day, always to cover an eighth\\npart of the figures with the projecting inner edges of the frames.\\nHe determined, therefore, to invent some means of doing without\\nframes for panels; and for this S. Sebastian he caused the panel to\\nbe made in the form of a half-circle, wherein he drew a niche in\\nperspective, which has the appearance of being carved in relief in\\nthe panel. Thus, painting a frame all round, he made an ornament for\\nthe figure in the middle; and he did the same for our S. Vincent,\\nand for the S. Mark that will be described after the S. Vincent. For\\nthe arch of a door leading into the sacristy, he painted in oils, on\\nwood, a figure of S. Vincent, a brother of that Order, representing\\nhim in the act of preaching on the Judgment, so that there may be\\nperceived in his gestures, and particularly in his head, that\\nvehemence and fury which are generally seen in the faces of\\npreachers, when they are doing their utmost, with threats of the\\nvengeance of God, to lead men hardened in sin into the perfect life;\\nin such a manner that this figure appears, to one who studies it\\nwith attention, to be not painted but real and alive, with such\\nstrong relief is it executed; and it is a pity that it is all\\ncracking and spoiling, on account of its having been painted with\\nfresh coats of colour on fresh size, as I said of the works of\\nPietro Perugino in the Convent of the Ingesuati.\\n\\nThe fancy took him, in order to show that he was able to make large\\nfigures--for he had been told that his manner was that of a\\nminiaturist--to paint on panel, for the wall in which is the door of\\nthe choir, a figure of S. Mark the Evangelist, five braccia in\\nheight, and executed with very good draughtsmanship and supreme\\nexcellence.\\n\\nAfter this, Salvadore Billi, a Florentine merchant, on his return\\nfrom Naples, having heard the fame of Fra Bartolommeo, and having\\nseen his works, caused him to paint a panel-picture of Christ the\\nSaviour, in allusion to his own name, with the four Evangelists\\nround Him; wherein, at the foot, are also two little boys upholding\\nthe globe of the world, whose flesh, fresh and tender, is\\nexcellently painted, as is the whole work, in which there are\\nlikewise two prophets that are much extolled. This panel stands in\\nthe Nunziata at Florence, below the great organ, according to the\\nwish of Salvadore; it is a very beautiful work, finished by Fra\\nBartolommeo with much lovingness and great perfection; and it is\\nsurrounded by an ornament of marble, all carved by the hand of\\nPietro Rosselli.\\n\\nAfterwards, having need of a change of air, the Prior at that time,\\nwho was his friend, sent him away to a monastery of his Order,\\nwherein, while he stayed there, he combined the labour of his hands\\nwith the contemplation of death, with profit both for his soul\\nand for the convent. For S. Martino in Lucca he painted a panel\\nwherein, at the feet of a Madonna, there is a little angel playing\\non a lute, together with S. Stephen and S. John; in which picture,\\nexecuted with excellent draughtsmanship and colouring, he proved his\\nability. For S. Romano, likewise, he painted a panel on canvas of\\nthe Madonna della Misericordia, who is placed on a pedestal of\\nstone, with some angels holding her mantle; and together with her\\nhe depicted a throng of people on some steps, some standing, others\\nseated, and others kneeling, but all gazing at a figure of Christ on\\nhigh, who is sending down lightnings and thunderbolts upon the\\npeople. Clearly did Fra Bartolommeo prove in this work how well he\\nwas able to manage the gradation of shadows and darks in painting,\\ngiving extraordinary relief to his figures, and showing a rare and\\nexcellent mastery over the difficulties of his art in colouring,\\ndrawing, and invention; and the work is as perfect as any that he\\never made. For the same church he painted another panel, also on\\ncanvas, containing a Christ and S. Catherine the Martyr, together\\nwith a S. Catherine of Siena, rapt in ecstasy from the earth, a\\nfigure as good as any that could possibly be painted in that manner.\\n\\n\\n\\nReturning to Florence, he gave some attention to the study of music;\\nand, delighting much therein, he would sometimes sing to pass the\\ntime. At Prato, opposite to the prison, he painted a panel-picture\\nof the Assumption. He executed some pictures of Our Lady for the\\nhouse of the Medici, and also other paintings for various people,\\nsuch as a picture of Our Lady which Lodovico di Lodovico Capponi has\\nin his apartment, and likewise another of the Virgin holding the\\nChild in her arms, with two heads of saints, that is in the\\npossession of the very Excellent Messer Lelio Torelli, Chief\\nSecretary to the most Illustrious Duke Cosimo, who holds it very\\ndear both on account of the genius of Fra Bartolommeo, and because\\nhe delights in, loves, and favours not only the men of our art, but\\nevery fine intellect. In the house of Piero del Pugliese, which now\\nbelongs to Matteo Botti, a citizen and merchant of Florence, in an\\nantechamber at the head of a staircase, he painted a S. George in\\narmour, on horseback, who is slaying the Dragon with his lance--a\\nvery spirited figure. This he executed in chiaroscuro, in oils, a\\nmethod that he much delighted to use for all his works, sketching\\nthem in the manner of a cartoon, with ink or with bitumen, before\\ncolouring them; as may still be seen from many beginnings of\\npictures and panels, which he left unfinished on account of his\\ndeath, and as may also be perceived from many drawings by his hand,\\nexecuted in chiaroscuro, of which the greater part are now in the\\nMonastery of S. Caterina da Siena on the Piazza di S. Marco, in\\nthe possession of a nun who paints, and of whom record will be made\\nin the proper place; while many made in the same way adorn our book\\nof drawings, honouring his memory, and some are in the hands of\\nMesser Francesco del Garbo, a most excellent physician.\\n\\nFra Bartolommeo always liked to have living objects before him when\\nhe was working; and in order to be able to draw draperies, armour,\\nand other suchlike things, he caused a life-size figure of wood to be\\nmade, which moved at the joints; and this he clothed with real\\ndraperies, from which he painted most beautiful things, being able\\nto keep them in position as long as he pleased, until he had brought\\nhis work to perfection. This figure, worm-eaten and ruined as it is,\\nis in our possession, treasured in memory of him.\\n\\nAt Arezzo, for the Abbey of the Black Friars, he made a head of\\nChrist in dark tints--a very beautiful work. He painted, also, the\\npanel of the Company of the Contemplanti, which was preserved in the\\nhouse of the Magnificent Messer Ottaviano de' Medici, and has now\\nbeen placed in a chapel of that house, with many ornaments, by his\\nson Messer Alessandro, who holds it very dear in memory of Fra\\nBartolommeo, and also because he takes vast pleasure in painting. In\\nthe chapel of the Noviciate of S. Marco there is a panel-picture of\\nthe Purification, very lovely, which he executed with good\\ndraughtsmanship and high finish. At S. Maria Maddalena, a seat of\\nthe Friars of his Order, without Florence, while staying there for\\nhis own pleasure, he made a Christ and a Magdalene; and he also\\npainted certain things in fresco in that convent. In like manner, he\\nwrought in fresco an arch over the strangers' apartment in S. Marco,\\nin which he painted Christ with Cleophas and Luke, and made a\\nportrait of Fra Niccolò della Magna, who was then a young man, and\\nwho afterwards became Archbishop of Capua, and finally a Cardinal.\\nHe began a panel for S. Gallo, afterwards finished by Giuliano\\nBugiardini, which is now on the high-altar of S. Jacopo fra Fossi,\\non the Canto degli Alberti; and likewise a picture of the Rape of\\nDinah, now in the possession of Messer Cristofano Rinieri, and\\nafterwards coloured by the same Giuliano, in which are buildings and\\nconceptions that are much extolled.\\n\\nFrom Piero Soderini he received the commission for the panel of the\\nCouncil Chamber, which he began in such a manner, drawing it in\\nchiaroscuro, that it seemed destined to do him very great credit;\\nand, unfinished as it is, it now has a place of honour in the Chapel\\nof the Magnificent Ottaviano de' Medici, in S. Lorenzo. In it are\\nall the Patron Saints of the city of Florence, and those saints on\\nwhose days that city has gained her victories; and there is also the\\nportrait of Fra Bartolommeo himself, made by him with a mirror. He\\nhad begun this picture, and had drawn the whole design, when it\\nhappened that, from working continually under a window, with the\\nlight from it beating on his back, he became completely paralyzed on\\nthat side of his body, and quite unable to move. Thereupon he was\\nadvised--such being the orders of his physicians--to go to the baths\\nof San Filippo; where he stayed a long time, but became very little\\nbetter thereby. Now Fra Bartolommeo was a great lover of fruit,\\nwhich pleased his palate mightily, although it was ruinous to his\\nhealth. Wherefore one morning, having eaten many figs, there came\\nupon him, in addition to his other infirmity, a very violent fever,\\nwhich cut short the course of his life in four days, at the age of\\nforty-eight; when, still wholly conscious, he rendered up his soul\\nto Heaven.\\n\\nHis death grieved his friends, and particularly the friars, who gave\\nhim honourable sepulture in their burial-place in S. Marco, on\\nOctober 8, in the year 1517. He had a dispensation from attending\\nany of the offices in the choir with the other friars, and the gains\\nfrom his works went to the convent, enough money being left in his\\nhands to pay for colours and other materials necessary for his\\npainting.\\n\\nHe left disciples in Cecchino del Frate, Benedetto Cianfanini,\\nGabriele Rustici, and Fra Paolo Pistoiese, the latter inheriting all\\nhis possessions. This Fra Paolo painted many panels and pictures\\nfrom his master's drawings, after his death; of which three are in\\nS. Domenico at Pistoia, and one at S. Maria del Sasso in the\\nCasentino.\\n\\nFra Bartolommeo gave such grace to his figures with his colouring,\\nand made them so novel and so modern in manner, that for these\\nreasons he deserves to be numbered by us among the benefactors of\\nart.\\n\\n\\nMARIOTTO ALBERTINELLI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \" OF MARIOTTO ALBERTINELLI\\n\\nPAINTER OF FLORENCE\\n\\n\\nMariotto Albertinelli, the closest and most intimate friend of Fra\\nBartolommeo--his other self, one might call him, not only on account\\nof the constant connection and intercourse between them, but also\\nthrough their similarity of manner during the period when Mariotto\\ngave proper attention to art--was the son of Biagio di Bindo\\nAlbertinelli. At the age of twenty he abandoned his calling of\\ngold-beater, in which he had been employed up to that time; and he\\nlearnt the first rudiments of painting in the workshop of Cosimo\\nRosselli, where he formed such an intimacy with Baccio della Porta,\\nthat they were one soul and one body. Such, indeed, was the\\nbrotherly friendship between them, that when Baccio took his leave\\nof Cosimo, in order to practise his art as a master by himself,\\nMariotto went off with him; whereupon they lived for a long time,\\nboth one and the other, at the Porta a S. Piero Gattolini, executing\\nmany works in company. And since Mariotto was not so well grounded\\nin drawing as was Baccio, he devoted himself to the study of such\\nantiquities as were then in Florence, the greater part and the best\\nof which were in the house of the Medici. He made a number of\\ndrawings of certain little panels in half-relief that were under the\\nloggia in the garden, on the side towards S. Lorenzo, in one of\\nwhich is Adonis with a very beautiful dog, and in another two nude\\nfigures, one seated, with a dog at its feet, and the other standing\\nwith the legs crossed, leaning on a staff. Both these panels are\\nmarvellous; and there are likewise two others of the same size, in\\none of which are two little boys carrying Jove's thunderbolt, while\\nin the other is the nude figure of an old man, with wings on his\\nshoulders and feet, representing Chance, and balancing a pair of\\nscales in his hands. In addition to these works, that garden was\\nfull of torsi of men and women, which were a school not only for\\nMariotto, but for all the sculptors and painters of his time. A good\\npart of these are now in the guardaroba of Duke Cosimo, and others,\\nsuch as the two torsi of Marsyas, the heads over the windows, and\\nthose of the Emperors over the doors, are still in the same place.\\n\\nBy studying these antiquities, Mariotto made great proficience in\\ndrawing; and he entered into the service of the mother of Duke\\nLorenzo, Madonna Alfonsina, who, desiring that he should devote\\nhimself to becoming an able master, offered him all possible\\nassistance. Dividing his time, therefore, between drawing and\\ncolouring, he became a passing good craftsman, as is proved by some\\npictures that he executed for that lady, which were sent by her to\\nRome, for Carlo and Giordano Orsini, and which afterwards came into\\nthe hands of Cæsar Borgia. He made a very good portrait of Madonna\\nAlfonsina from the life; and it seemed to him, on account of his\\nfriendship with her, that his fortune was made, when, in the year\\n1494, Piero de' Medici was banished, and her assistance and favour\\nfailed him. Whereupon he returned to the workshop of Baccio, where\\nhe set himself with even greater zeal to make models of clay and to\\nincrease his knowledge, labouring at the study of nature, and\\nimitating the works of Baccio, so that in a few years he became a\\nsound and practised master. And then, seeing his work succeeding so\\nwell, he so grew in courage, that, imitating the manner and method\\nof his companion, the hand of Mariotto was taken by many for that of\\nFra Bartolommeo.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut when he heard that Baccio had gone off to become a monk,\\nMariotto was almost overwhelmed and out of his mind; and so strange\\ndid the news seem to him, that he was in despair, and nothing could\\ncheer him. If it had not been, indeed, that Mariotto could not then\\nendure having anything to do with monks, against whom he was ever\\nrailing, and belonged to the party that was opposed to the faction\\nof Fra Girolamo of Ferrara, his love for Baccio would have wrought\\nupon him so strongly, that it would have forced him to don the cowl\\nin the same convent as his companion. However, he was besought by\\nGerozzo Dini, who had given the commission for the Judgment that\\nBaccio had left unfinished in the Ossa, that he, having a manner\\nsimilar to Baccio's, should undertake to finish it; whereupon, being\\nalso moved by the circumstance that the cartoon completed by the\\nhand of Baccio and other drawings were there, and by the entreaties\\nof Fra Bartolommeo himself, who had received money on account of the\\npainting, and was troubled in conscience at not having kept his\\npromise, he finished the work, and executed all that was wanting\\nwith diligence and love, in such a way that many, not knowing this,\\nthink that it was painted by one single hand; and this brought him\\nvast credit among craftsmen.\\n\\nIn the Chapter-house of the Certosa of Florence he executed a\\nCrucifixion, with Our Lady and the Magdalene at the foot of the\\nCross, and some angels in the sky, who are receiving the blood of\\nChrist; a work wrought in fresco, with diligence and lovingness, and\\npassing well painted. Now some of the young men who were learning\\nart under him, thinking that the friars were not giving them proper\\nfood, had counterfeited, without the knowledge of Mariotto, the keys\\nof those windows opening into the friar's rooms, through which their\\npittance is passed; and sometimes, in secret, they stole some of it,\\nnow from one and now from another. There was a great uproar about\\nthis among the friars, since in the matter of eating they are as\\nsensitive as any other person; but the lads did it with great\\ndexterity, and, since they were held to be honest fellows, the blame\\nfell on some of the friars, who were said to be doing it from hatred\\nof one another. However, one day the truth was revealed, and the\\nfriars, to the end that the work might be finished, gave a double\\nallowance to Mariotto and his lads, who finished the work with great\\nglee and laughter.\\n\\nFor the Nuns of S. Giuliano in Florence he painted the panel of\\ntheir high-altar, which he executed in a room that he had in the\\nGualfonda; together with another for the same church, with a\\nCrucifix, some Angels, and God the Father, representing the Trinity,\\nin oils and on a gold ground.\\n\\nMariotto was a most restless person, devoted to the pleasures of\\nlove, and a good liver in the matter of eating; wherefore,\\nconceiving a hatred for the subtleties and brain-rackings of\\npainting, and being often wounded by the tongues of other painters\\n(according to the undying custom among them, handed down from one to\\nanother), he resolved to turn to a more humble, less fatiguing, and\\nmore cheerful art. And so, having opened a very fine inn, without\\nthe Porta S. Gallo, and a tavern and inn on the Ponte Vecchio, at\\nthe Dragon, he followed that calling for many months, saying that he\\nhad chosen an art without foreshortenings, muscles, and\\nperspectives, and, what was much more important, free from censure,\\nand that the art which he had given up was quite the contrary of his\\nnew one, since the former imitated flesh and blood, and the latter\\nmade both blood and flesh; and now, having good wine, he heard\\nhimself praised all day long, whereas before he used to hear nothing\\nbut censure.\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, having grown weary of this as well, and ashamed of the\\nbaseness of his calling, he returned to painting, and executed\\npictures and paintings for the houses of citizens in Florence. For\\nGiovan Maria Benintendi he painted three little scenes with his own\\nhand; and for the house of the Medici, at the election of Leo X, he\\npainted a round picture of his arms, in oils, with Faith, Hope, and\\nCharity, which hung for a long time over the door of their palace.\\nHe undertook to make, in the Company of S. Zanobi, near the\\nChapter-house of S. Maria del Fiore, a panel-picture of the\\nAnnunciation, which he executed with great labour. For this he\\ncaused special windows to be made, wishing to work on the spot, in\\norder to be able to make the views recede, where they were high and\\ndistant, by lowering the tones, or to bring them forward, at his\\npleasure. Now he had conceived the idea that pictures which have no\\nrelief and force, combined with delicacy, are of no account; but\\nsince he knew that they cannot be made to stand out from the surface\\nwithout shadows, which, if they are too dark, remain indistinct,\\nwhile, if they are delicate, they have no force, he was eager to\\ncombine this delicacy with a certain method of treatment to which up\\nto that time, so it seemed to him, art had not attained in any\\nsatisfactory manner. Wherefore, looking on this work as an\\nopportunity for accomplishing this, he set himself, to this end, to\\nmake extraordinary efforts, which may be recognized in a figure\\nof God the Father, which is in the sky, and in some little children,\\nwho stand out from the panel in strong relief against a dark\\nbackground in perspective that he made there with a ceiling in the\\nform of a barrel-shaped vault, which, with its arches curving and\\nits lines diminishing to a point, recedes inwards in such a manner\\nthat it appears to be in relief; besides which, there are some\\nangels scattering flowers as they fly, that are very graceful.\\n\\nThis work was painted out and painted in again many times by\\nMariotto before he could bring it to completion. He was for ever\\nchanging the colouring, making it now lighter, now darker, and\\nsometimes more lively and glowing, sometimes less; but, never being\\ncompletely satisfied, and never persuaded that he had done justice\\nwith his hand to the thoughts of his intellect, he wished to find a\\nwhite that should be more brilliant than lead-white, and set\\nhimself, therefore, to clarify the latter, in order to be able to\\nheighten the highest light to his own satisfaction. However, having\\nrecognized that he was not able to express by means of art all that\\nthe intelligence of the human brain grasps and comprehends, he\\ncontented himself with what he had achieved, since he could not\\nattain to what it was not possible to reach. This work brought\\nMariotto praise and honour among craftsmen, but by no means as much\\nprofit as he hoped to gain from his patrons in return for his\\nlabours, since a dispute arose between him and those who had\\ncommissioned him to paint it. But Pietro Perugino, then an old man,\\nRidolfo Ghirlandajo, and Francesco Granacci valued it, and settled\\nthe price of the work by common consent.\\n\\nFor S. Pancrazio, in Florence, Mariotto painted a semicircular\\npicture of the Visitation of Our Lady. For S. Trinità, likewise, he\\nexecuted with diligence a panel-picture of Our Lady, S. Jerome, and\\nS. Zanobi, at the commission of Zanobi del Maestro; and for the\\nChurch of the Congregation of the Priests of S. Martino, he painted\\na picture on panel of the Visitation, which is much extolled. He was\\ninvited to the Convent of La Quercia, without Viterbo; but after\\nhaving begun a panel there, he conceived a desire to see Rome.\\nHaving made his way to that city, therefore, he executed to\\nperfection for the Chapel of Fra Mariano Fetti in S. Silvestro di\\nMonte Cavallo, a panel-picture in oils of S. Dominic, S. Catherine\\nof Siena, with Christ marrying her, and Our Lady, in a delicate\\nmanner. He then returned to La Quercia, where he had a mistress, to\\nwhom, on account of the desire that he had felt while he was in Rome\\nand could not enjoy her love, he sought to show that he was valiant\\nin the lists; wherefore he exerted himself so much, that, being no\\nlonger young and so stalwart in such efforts, he was forced to take\\nto his bed. And laying the blame for this on the air of the place,\\nhe had himself carried to Florence in a litter; but no expedients or\\nremedies availed him in his sickness, from which he died in a few\\ndays, at the age of forty-five. He was buried in S. Piero Maggiore,\\nin that city.\\n\\nThere are some drawings by the hand of this master in our book,\\nexecuted with the pen and in chiaroscuro, which are very good;\\nparticularly a spiral staircase, drawn with great ingenuity in\\nperspective, of which he had a good knowledge.\\n\\nMariotto had many disciples; among others, Giuliano Bugiardini and\\nFranciabigio, both Florentines, and Innocenzio da Imola, of whom we\\nwill speak in the proper place. Visino, a painter of Florence, was\\nlikewise his disciple, and excelled all these others in drawing,\\ncolouring, and industry, showing, also, a better manner in the works\\nthat he made, which he executed with great diligence. A few of them\\nare still in Florence; and one can study his work at the present day\\nin the house of Giovan Battista d' Agnol Doni, in a mirror--picture\\npainted in oils after the manner of a miniature, wherein are Adam and\\nEve naked, eating the apple, a work executed with great care; and from\\nanother picture, of Christ being taken down from the Cross, together\\nwith the Thieves, in which there is a beautifully contrived\\ncomplication of ladders, with some men aiding each other to take down\\nthe body of Christ, and others bearing one of the Thieves on their\\nshoulders to burial, and all the figures in varied and fantastic\\nattitudes, suited to that subject, and proving that he was an able\\nman. The same master was brought by some Florentine merchants to\\nHungary, where he executed many works and gained great renown. But the\\npoor man was soon in danger of coming to an evil end, because, being\\nof a frank and free-spoken nature, he was not able to endure the\\nwearisome persistence of some Hungarians, who kept tormenting him all\\nday long with praises of their own country, as if there were no\\npleasure or happiness in anything except eating and drinking in their\\nstifling rooms, and no grandeur or nobility save in their King and his\\nCourt, all the rest of the world being rubbish. It seemed to him (and\\nindeed it is true) that in Italy there was another kind of excellence,\\nculture, and beauty; and one day, being weary of their nonsense, and\\nchancing to be a little merry, he let slip the opinion that a flask of\\nTrebbiano and a berlingozzo were worth all the Kings and Queens\\nthat had ever reigned in those regions. And if the matter had not\\nhappened to fall into the hands of a Bishop, who was a gentleman and a\\nman of the world, and also, above all, a tactful person, both able and\\nwilling to turn the thing into a joke, Visino would have learnt not to\\nplay with savages; for those brutes of Hungarians, not understanding\\nhis words, and thinking that he had uttered something terrible, such\\nas a threat that he would rob their King of his life and throne,\\nwished to give him short shrift and crucify him by mob-law. But the\\ngood Bishop drew him out of all embarrassment, and, appraising the\\nmerit of the excellent master at its true value, and putting a good\\ncomplexion on the affair, restored him to the favour of the King, who,\\non hearing the story, was much amused by it.

       " \" OF RAFFAELLINO DEL GARBO\\n\\nPAINTER OF FLORENCE\\n\\n\\nRaffaello del Garbo, while he was a little boy, was called by the pet\\nname of Raffaellino, which he retained ever afterwards; and in his\\nearliest days he gave such promise in his art, that he was already\\nnumbered among the most excellent masters, a thing which happens to\\nfew. But still fewer meet the fate which afterwards came upon him,\\nin that from a splendid beginning and almost certain hopes, he\\narrived at a very feeble end. For it is a general rule, in the world\\nboth of nature and of art, for things to grow gradually from small\\nbeginnings, little by little, until they reach their highest\\nperfection. It is true, however, that many laws both of art and of\\nnature are unknown to us, nor do they hold to one unvarying order at\\nall times and in every case, a thing which very often renders\\nuncertain the judgments of men. How this may happen is seen in\\nRaffaellino, since it appeared that in him nature and art did their\\nutmost to set out from extraordinary beginnings, the middle stage of\\nwhich was below mediocrity, and the end almost nothing.\\n\\nIn his youth he drew as much as any painter who has ever exercised\\nhimself in drawing in order to become perfect; wherefore there may\\nstill be seen, throughout the world of art, a great number of his\\ndrawings, which have been dispersed by a son of his for ridiculous\\nprices, partly drawn with the style, partly with the pen or in\\nwater-colours, but all on tinted paper, heightened with lead-white,\\nand executed with marvellous boldness and mastery; and there are\\nmany of them in our book, drawn in a most beautiful manner. Besides\\nthis, he learnt to paint so well in distemper and in fresco, that\\nhis first works were executed with an incredible patience and\\ndiligence, as has been related.\\n\\nIn the Minerva, round the tomb of Cardinal Caraffa, he painted the\\nvaulted ceiling, with such delicacy, that it seems like the work of\\nan illuminator; wherefore it was held in great estimation by\\ncraftsmen at that time. His master, Filippo, regarded him in some\\nrespects as a much better painter than himself; and Raffaellino had\\nacquired Filippo's manner so well, that there were few who could\\ndistinguish the one from the other. Later, after having left his\\nmaster, he gave much more delicacy to that manner in the draperies,\\nand greater softness to hair and to the expressions of the heads;\\nand he was held in such expectation by craftsmen, that, while he\\nfollowed this manner, he was considered the first of the young\\npainters of his day. Now the family of the Capponi, having built a\\nchapel that is called the Paradiso, on the hill below the Church of\\nS. Bartolommeo a Monte Oliveto, without the Porta a S. Friano,\\nwished to have the panel executed by Raffaellino, and gave him the\\ncommission; whereupon he painted in oils the Resurrection of Christ,\\nwith some soldiers who have fallen, as if dead, round the Sepulchre.\\nThese figures are very spirited and beautiful, and they have the\\nmost graceful heads that it is possible to see; among which, in the\\nhead of a young man, is a marvellous portrait of Niccola Capponi,\\nwhile, in like manner, the head of one who is crying out because the\\nstone covering of the tomb has fallen upon him, is most beautiful\\nand bizarre. Wherefore the Capponi, having seen that Raffaellino's\\npicture was a rare work, caused a frame to be made for it, all\\ncarved, with round columns richly adorned with burnished gold on a\\nground of bole. Before many years had passed, the campanile of that\\nbuilding was struck by lightning, which pierced the vault and fell\\nnear that panel, which, having been executed in oils, suffered no\\nharm; but where the fluid passed near the gilt frame, it consumed\\nthe gold, leaving nothing there but the bare bole. It has seemed to\\nme right to say that much with regard to oil-painting, to the end\\nthat all may see how important it is to know how to guard against\\nsuch injury, which lightning has done not only to this work, but to\\nmany others.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe painted in fresco, at the corner of a house that now belongs to\\nMatteo Botti, between the Canto del Ponte alla Carraja and the Canto\\ndella Cuculia, a little shrine containing Our Lady with the Child\\nin her arms, with S. Catherine and S. Barbara kneeling, a very\\ngraceful and carefully executed work. For the Villa of Marignolle,\\nbelonging to the Girolami, he painted two most beautiful panels,\\nwith Our Lady, S. Zanobi, and other saints; and he filled the\\npredella below both of these with little figures representing scenes\\nfrom the lives of those saints, executed with great diligence. On\\nthe wall above the door of the Church of the Nuns of S. Giorgio, he\\npainted a Pietà, with a group of the Maries; and in like manner, in\\nanother arch below this, a figure of Our Lady, a work worthy of\\ngreat praise, executed in the year 1504. In the Church of S. Spirito\\nat Florence, in a panel over that of the Nerli, which his master\\nFilippo had executed, he painted a Pietà, which is held to be a very\\ngood and praiseworthy work; but in another, representing S. Bernard,\\nhe fell short of that standard. Below the door of the sacristy are\\ntwo panel-pictures by his hand; one showing S. Gregory the Pope\\nsaying Mass, when Christ appears to him, naked, with the Cross on\\nHis shoulder, and shedding blood from His side, with the deacon and\\nsub-deacon, in their vestments, serving the Mass, and two angels\\nswinging censers over the body of Christ. For another chapel, lower\\ndown, he executed a panel-picture containing Our Lady, S. Jerome,\\nand S. Bartholomew. On these two works he bestowed no little labour;\\nbut he went on deteriorating from day to day. I do not know to what\\nI should attribute his misfortune, for poor Raffaellino was not\\nwanting in industry, diligence, and application; yet they availed\\nhim little. It is believed, indeed, that, becoming overburdened and\\nimpoverished by the cares of a family, and being compelled to use\\nfor his daily needs whatever he earned, not to mention that he was a\\nman of no great spirit and undertook to do work for small prices, in\\nthis way he went on growing worse little by little; although there\\nis always something of the good to be seen in his works.\\n\\nFor the Monks of Cestello, on the wall of their refectory, he\\npainted a large scene coloured in fresco, in which he depicted the\\nmiracle wrought by Jesus Christ with the five loaves and two fishes,\\nwith which he satisfied five thousand people. For the Abbot de'\\nPanichi he executed the panel-picture of the high-altar in the\\nChurch of S. Salvi, without the Porta alla Croce, painting therein\\nOur Lady, S. Giovanni Gualberto, S. Salvi, S. Bernardo, a Cardinal\\nof the Uberti family, and S. Benedetto the Abbot, and, at the sides,\\nS. Batista and S. Fedele in armour, in two niches on either hand of\\nthe picture, which had a rich frame; and in the predella are several\\nscenes, with little figures, from the Life of S. Giovanni Gualberto.\\nIn all this he acquitted himself very well, because he was assisted\\nin his wretchedness by that Abbot, who took pity on him for the sake\\nof his talents; and in the predella of the panel Raffaellino made a\\nportrait of him from life, together with one of the General who was\\nthen ruling his Order. In S. Piero Maggiore, on the right as one\\nenters the church, there is a panel by his hand, and in the Murate\\nthere is a picture of S. Sigismund, the King. For Girolamo\\nFederighi, in that part of S. Pancrazio where he was afterwards\\nburied, he painted a Trinity in fresco, with portraits of him and of\\nhis wife on their knees; and here he began to decline into pettiness\\nof manner. He also made two figures in distemper for the Monks of\\nCestello, a S. Rocco and a S. Ignazio, which are in the Chapel of S.\\nSebastiano. And in a little chapel on the abutment of the Ponte\\nRubaconte, on the side towards the Mills, he painted a Madonna, a S.\\nLaurence, and another saint.\\n\\nIn the end he was reduced to undertaking any work, however mean; and\\nhe was employed by certain nuns and other persons, who were\\nembroidering a quantity of church vestments and hangings at that\\ntime, to make designs in chiaroscuro and ornamental borders\\ncontaining saints and stories, for ridiculous prices. For although\\nhe had deteriorated, there sometimes issued from his hand most\\nbeautiful designs and fancies, as is proved by many drawings that\\nwere sold and dispersed after the death of those who used them for\\nembroidery; of which there are many in the book of the illustrious\\nhospital-director, that show how able he was in draughtsmanship.\\nThis was the reason that many vestments, hangings, and ornaments,\\nwhich are held to be very beautiful, were made for the churches of\\nFlorence and throughout the Florentine territory, and also for\\nCardinals and Bishops in Rome. At the present day this method of\\nembroidery, which was used by Paolo da Verona, the Florentine\\nGalieno, and others like them, is almost lost, and another method,\\nwith wide stitches, has been introduced, which has neither the same\\nbeauty nor the same careful workmanship, and is much less durable\\nthan the other. Wherefore, in return for this benefit, although\\npoverty caused him misery and hardship during his lifetime, he\\ndeserves to have honour and glory for his talents after his death.\\n\\nAnd in truth Raffaellino was unfortunate in his connections, for he\\nalways mixed with poor and humble people, like a man who had sunk\\nand become ashamed of himself, seeing that in his youth he had given\\nsuch great promise, and now knew how distant he was from the\\nextraordinary excellence of the works that he had made at that time.\\nAnd thus, growing old, he fell away so much from his early standard,\\nthat his works no longer appeared to be by his hand; and forgetting\\nhis art more and more every day, he was reduced to painting, in\\naddition to his usual panels and pictures, the meanest kinds of\\nworks. And he sank so low that everything was a torment to him, but\\nabove all his burdensome family of children, which turned all his\\nability in art into mere clumsiness. Wherefore, being overtaken by\\ninfirmities and impoverished, he finished his life in misery at the\\nage of fifty-eight, and was buried in S. Simone, at Florence, by the\\nCompany of the Misericordia, in the year 1524.\\n\\nHe left behind him many pupils who became able masters. One, who\\nwent in his boyhood to learn the rudiments of art from Raffaellino,\\nwas the Florentine painter Bronzino, who afterwards acquitted\\nhimself so well under the wing of Jacopo da Pontormo, another\\npainter of Florence, that he has made as much proficience in the art\\nas his master Jacopo. The portrait of Raffaellino was copied from a\\ndrawing that belonged to Bastiano da Monte Carlo, who was also his\\ndisciple, and who, for a man with no draughtsmanship, became a\\npassing good master.\\n\\n\\nTORRIGIANO\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " ' OF TORRIGIANO\\n\\nSCULPTOR OF FLORENCE\\n\\n\\nGreat is the power of anger in the soul of one who is seeking, with\\narrogance and pride, to gain a reputation for excellence in some\\nprofession, when he sees rising in the same art, at a time when he\\ndoes not expect it, some unknown man of beautiful genius, who not\\nonly equals him, but in time surpasses him by a great measure. Of\\nsuch persons, in truth, it may be said that there is no iron that\\nthey would not gnaw in their rage, nor any evil which they would not\\ndo if they were able, for it seems to them too grievous an affront\\nin the eyes of the world, that children whom they saw born should\\nhave reached maturity almost in one bound from their cradles. They\\ndo not reflect that every day one may see the will of young men,\\nspurred on by zeal in their tender years, and exercised by them in\\ncontinual studies, rise to infinite heights; while the old, led by\\nfear, pride, and ambition, lose the cunning of their hands, so that\\nthe better they think to work, the worse they do it, and where they\\nbelieve that they are advancing, they are going backwards.\\nWherefore, out of envy, they never give credit to the young for the\\nperfection of their works, however clearly they may see it, on\\naccount of the obstinacy that possesses them. And it is known from\\nexperience that when, in order to show what they can do, they exert\\nthemselves to the utmost of their power, they often produce works\\nthat are ridiculous and a mere laughing-stock. In truth, when\\ncraftsmen have reached the age when the eye is no longer steady and\\nthe hand trembles, their place, if they have saved the wherewithal\\nto live, is to give advice to men who can work, for the reason that\\nthe arts of painting and sculpture call for a mind in every way\\nvigorous and awake (as it is at the age when the blood is boiling),\\nfull of burning desire, and a capital enemy of the pleasures of the\\nworld. And whoever is not temperate with regard to the delights of\\nthe world should shun the studies of any art or science whatsoever,\\nseeing that such pleasures and study can never agree well together.\\nSince, therefore, these arts involve so many burdens, few, indeed,\\nare they who attain to the highest rank; and those who start with\\neagerness from the post are greater in number than those who run\\nwell in the race and win the prize.\\n\\nNow there was more pride than art, although he was very able, to be\\nseen in Torrigiano, a sculptor of Florence, who in his youth was\\nmaintained by the elder Lorenzo de\\' Medici in the garden which that\\nmagnificent citizen possessed on the Piazza di S. Marco in Florence.\\nThis garden was in such wise filled with the best ancient statuary,\\nthat the loggia, the walks, and all the apartments were adorned with\\nnoble ancient figures of marble, pictures, and other suchlike\\nthings, made by the hands of the best masters who ever lived in\\nItaly or elsewhere. And all these works, in addition to the\\nmagnificence and adornment that they conferred on that garden, were\\nas a school or academy for the young painters and sculptors, as well\\nas for all others who were studying the arts of design, and\\nparticularly for the young nobles; since the Magnificent Lorenzo had\\na strong conviction that those who are born of noble blood can\\nattain to perfection in all things more readily and more speedily\\nthan is possible, for the most part, for men of humble birth, in\\nwhom there are rarely seen those conceptions and that marvellous\\ngenius which are perceived in men of illustrious stock. Moreover,\\nthe less highly born, having generally to defend themselves from\\nhardship and poverty, and being forced in consequence to undertake\\nany sort of work, however mean, are not able to exercise their\\nintellect, or to attain to the highest degree of excellence.\\nWherefore it was well said by the learned Alciato--when speaking of\\nmen of beautiful genius, born in poverty, who are not able to raise\\nthemselves, because, in proportion as they are impelled upwards by\\nthe wings of their genius, so are they held down by their poverty--\\n\\n  Ut me pluma levat, sic grave mergit onus.\\n\\nLorenzo the Magnificent, then, always favoured men of genius, and\\nparticularly such of the nobles as showed an inclination for these\\nour arts; wherefore it is no marvel that from that school there\\nshould have issued some who have amazed the world. And what is more,\\nhe not only gave the means to buy food and clothing to those who,\\nbeing poor, would otherwise not have been able to pursue the studies\\nof design, but also bestowed extraordinary gifts on any one among\\nthem who had acquitted himself in some work better than the others;\\nso that the young students of our arts, competing thus with each\\nother, thereby became very excellent, as I will relate.\\n\\nThe guardian and master of these young men, at that time, was the\\nFlorentine sculptor Bertoldo, an old and practised craftsman, who\\nhad once been a disciple of Donato. He taught them, and likewise had\\ncharge of the works in the garden, and of many drawings, cartoons,\\nand models by the hand of Donato, Pippo, Masaccio, Paolo\\nUccello, Fra Giovanni, Fra Filippo, and other masters, both native\\nand foreign. It is a sure fact that these arts can only be acquired\\nby a long course of study in drawing and diligently imitating works\\nof excellence; and whoever has not such facilities, however much he\\nmay be assisted by nature, can never arrive at perfection, save late\\nin life.\\n\\nBut to return to the antiquities of the garden; they were in great\\npart dispersed in the year 1494, when Piero, the son of the\\naforesaid Lorenzo, was banished from Florence, all being sold by\\nauction. The greater part of them, however, were restored to the\\nMagnificent Giuliano in the year 1512, at the time when he and the\\nother members of the House of Medici returned to their country; and\\nat the present day they are for the most part preserved in the\\nguardaroba of Duke Cosimo. Truly magnificent was the example thus\\ngiven by Lorenzo, and whenever Princes and other persons of high\\ndegree choose to imitate it, they will always gain everlasting\\nhonour and glory thereby; since he who assists and favours, in their\\nnoble undertakings, men of rare and beautiful genius, from whom the\\nworld receives such beauty, honour, convenience and benefit,\\ndeserves to live for ever in the minds and memories of mankind.\\n\\nAmong those who studied the arts of design in that garden, the\\nfollowing all became very excellent masters; Michelagnolo, the son\\nof Lodovico Buonarroti; Giovan Francesco Rustici; Torrigiano\\nTorrigiani; Francesco Granacci; Niccolò, the son of Jacopo\\nSoggi; Lorenzo di Credi, and Giuliano Bugiardini; and, among the\\nforeigners, Baccio da Montelupo, Andrea Contucci of Monte Sansovino,\\nand others, of whom mention will be made in the proper places.\\n\\nTorrigiano, then, whose Life we are now about to write, was a\\nstudent in the garden with those named above; and he was not only\\npowerful in person, and proud and fearless in spirit, but also by\\nnature so overbearing and choleric, that he was for ever tyrannizing\\nover all the others both with words and deeds. His chief profession\\nwas sculpture, yet he worked with great delicacy in terra-cotta, in\\na very good and beautiful manner. But not being able to endure that\\nany one should surpass him, he would set himself to spoil with his\\nhands such of the works of others as showed an excellence that he\\ncould not achieve with his brain; and if these others resented this,\\nhe often had recourse to something stronger than words. He had a\\nparticular hatred for Michelagnolo, for no other reason than that he\\nsaw him attending zealously to the study of art, and knew that he\\nused to draw in secret at his own house by night and on feast-days,\\nso that he came to succeed better in the garden than all the others,\\nand was therefore much favoured by Lorenzo the Magnificent.\\nWherefore, moved by bitter envy, Torrigiano was always seeking to\\naffront him, both in word and deed; and one day, having come to\\nblows, Torrigiano struck Michelagnolo so hard on the nose with his\\nfist, that he broke it, insomuch that Michelagnolo had his nose\\nflattened for the rest of his life. This matter becoming known to\\nLorenzo, he was so enraged that Torrigiano, if he had not fled from\\nFlorence, would have suffered some heavy punishment.\\n\\n\\n\\nHaving therefore made his way to Rome, where Alexander VI was then\\npressing on the work of the Borgia Tower, Torrigiano executed in it\\na great quantity of stucco-work, in company with other masters.\\nAfterwards, money being offered in the service of Duke Valentino,\\nwho was making war against the people of Romagna, Torrigiano was\\nled away by certain young Florentines; and, having changed himself\\nin a moment from a sculptor to a soldier, he bore himself valiantly\\nin those campaigns of Romagna. He did the same under Paolo Vitelli\\nin the war with Pisa; and he was with Piero de\\' Medici at the action\\non the Garigliano, where he won the right to arms, and the name of a\\nvaliant standard-bearer.\\n\\nBut in the end, recognizing that he was never likely to reach the\\nrank of captain that he desired, although he deserved it, and that\\nhe had saved nothing in the wars, and had, on the contrary, wasted\\nhis time, he returned to sculpture. For certain Florentine\\nmerchants, then, he made small works in marble and bronze, little\\nfigures, which are scattered throughout the houses of citizens in\\nFlorence, and he executed many drawings in a bold and excellent\\nmanner, as may be seen from some by his hand that are in our book,\\ntogether with others which he made in competition with Michelagnolo.\\nAnd having been brought by those merchants to England, he executed\\nthere, in the service of the King, an endless number of works in\\nmarble, bronze, and wood, competing with some masters of that\\ncountry, to all of whom he proved superior. For this he was so well\\nand so richly rewarded, that, if he had not been as reckless and\\nunbridled as he was proud, he might have lived a life of ease and\\nended his days in comfort; but what happened to him was the very\\nopposite.\\n\\nAfter this, having been summoned from England into Spain, he made\\nmany works there, which are scattered about in various places, and\\nare held in great estimation; and, among others, he made a Crucifix\\nof terra-cotta, which is the most marvellous thing that there is in\\nall Spain. For a monastery of Friars of S. Jerome, without the city\\nof Seville, he made another Crucifix; a S. Jerome in Penitence, with\\nhis lion, the figure of that Saint being a portrait of an old\\nhouse-steward of the Botti family, Florentine merchants settled in\\nSpain; and a Madonna with the Child. This last figure was so\\nbeautiful that it led to his making another like it for the Duke of\\nArcus, who, in order to obtain it, made such promises to Torrigiano,\\nthat he believed that it would make him rich for the rest of his\\nlife. The work being finished, the Duke gave him so many of those\\ncoins that are called \"maravedis,\" which are worth little or\\nnothing, that Torrigiano, to whose house there came two persons\\nladen with them, became even more confirmed in his belief that he\\nwas to be a very rich man. But afterwards, having shown this money\\nto a Florentine friend of his, and having asked him to count it and\\nreckon its value in Italian coin, he saw that all that vast sum did\\nnot amount to thirty ducats; at which, holding himself to have been\\nfooled, he went in a violent rage to where the figure was that he\\nhad made for the Duke, and wholly destroyed it. Whereupon that\\nSpaniard, considering himself affronted, denounced Torrigiano as a\\nheretic; on which account he was thrown into prison, and after being\\nexamined every day, and sent from one inquisitor to the other, he\\nwas finally judged to deserve the severest penalty. But this was\\nnever put into execution, because Torrigiano himself was plunged\\nthereby into such melancholy, that, remaining many days without\\neating, and thus becoming very weak, little by little he put an end\\nto his own life; and in this way, by denying himself his food, he\\navoided the shame into which he would perchance have fallen, for it\\nwas believed that he had been condemned to death.\\n\\nThe works of this master date about the year of our salvation, 1515,\\nand he died in the year 1522.\\n\\n\\nGIULIANO AND ANTONIO DA SAN GALLO\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " ' OF GIULIANO AND ANTONIO DA SAN GALLO\\n\\nARCHITECTS OF FLORENCE\\n\\n\\nFrancesco di Paolo Giamberti, who was a passing good architect in\\nthe time of Cosimo de\\' Medici, and was much employed by him, had two\\nsons, Giuliano and Antonio, whom he apprenticed to the art of\\nwood-carving. One of these two sons, Giuliano, he placed with\\nFrancione, a joiner, an ingenious person, who gave attention at the\\nsame time to wood-carving and to perspective, and with whom\\nFrancesco was very intimate, since they had executed many works in\\ncompany, both in carving and in architecture, for Lorenzo de\\'\\nMedici. This Giuliano learnt so well all that Francione taught him,\\nthat the carvings and beautiful perspectives that he afterwards\\nexecuted by himself in the choir of the Duomo of Pisa are still\\nregarded not without marvel at the present day, even among the many\\nnew perspectives.\\n\\nWhile Giuliano was studying design, and his young blood ran hot in\\nhis veins, the army of the Duke of Calabria, by reason of the hatred\\nwhich that lord bore to Lorenzo de\\' Medici, encamped before\\nCastellina, in order to occupy the dominions of the Signoria of\\nFlorence, and also, if this should be successful, in order to\\naccomplish some greater design. Wherefore Lorenzo the Magnificent\\nwas forced to send an engineer to Castellina, who might make mills\\nand bastions, and should have the charge of handling the artillery,\\nwhich few men at that time were able to do; and he sent thither\\nGiuliano, considering him to have a mind more able, more ready, and\\nmore resolute than any other man, and knowing him already as the son\\nof Francesco, who had been a devoted servant of the House of Medici.\\n\\nArriving at Castellina, therefore, Giuliano fortified that place\\nwith good walls and mills, both within and without, and furnished\\nit with everything else necessary for the defence. Then, observing\\nthat the artillery-men stood at a great distance from their pieces,\\nhandling, loading, and discharging them with much timidity, he gave\\nhis attention to this, and so contrived that from that time onwards\\nthe artillery did harm to no one, whereas it had previously killed\\nmany of them, since they had not had judgment and knowledge enough\\nto avoid suffering injury from the recoil. Having therefore taken\\ncharge of the artillery, Giuliano showed great skill in discharging\\nit to the best possible advantage; and the Duke\\'s forces so lost\\nheart by reason of this and other adverse circumstances, that they\\nwere glad to make terms and depart from the town. In consequence of\\nthis Giuliano won no little praise from Lorenzo in Florence, and was\\nlooked upon with favour and affection ever afterwards.\\n\\nHaving meanwhile given his attention to architecture, he began the\\nfirst cloister of the Monastery of Cestello, and executed that part\\nof it that is seen to be of the Ionic Order; placing capitals on the\\ncolumns with volutes curving downwards to the collarino, where the\\nshaft of the column ends, and making, below the ovoli and the\\nfusarole, a frieze, one-third in height of the diameter of the\\ncolumn. This capital was copied from a very ancient one of marble,\\nfound at Fiesole by Messer Leonardo Salutati, Bishop of that place,\\nwho kept it for some time, together with other antiquities, in a\\nhouse and garden that he occupied in the Via di S. Gallo, opposite\\nto S. Agata; and it is now in the possession of Messer Giovan\\nBattista da Ricasoli, Bishop of Pistoia, and is prized for its beauty\\nand variety, since among the ancient capitals there has not been\\nseen another like it. But that cloister remained unfinished, because\\nthose monks were not then able to bear such an expense.\\n\\nMeanwhile Giuliano had come into even greater credit with Lorenzo;\\nand the latter, who was intending to build a palace at Poggio a\\nCajano, a place between Florence and Pistoia, and had caused several\\nmodels to be made for it by Francione and by others, commissioned\\nGiuliano, also, to make one of the sort of building that he proposed\\nto erect. And Giuliano made it so completely different in form from\\nthe others, and so much to Lorenzo\\'s fancy, that he began\\nstraightway to have it carried into execution, as the best of all\\nthe models; on which account he took Giuliano even more into his\\nfavour, and ever afterwards gave him an allowance.\\n\\nAfter this, Giuliano wishing to make a vaulted ceiling for the great\\nhall of that palace in the manner that we call barrel-shaped,\\nLorenzo could not believe, on account of the great space, that it\\ncould be raised. Whereupon Giuliano, who was building a house for\\nhimself in Florence, made a ceiling for his hall according to the\\ndesign of the other, in order to convince the mind of that\\nMagnificent Prince; and Lorenzo therefore gave orders for the\\nceiling at the Poggio to be carried out, which was successfully\\ndone.\\n\\nBy that time the fame of Giuliano had so increased, that, at the\\nentreaty of the Duke of Calabria, he was commissioned by Lorenzo the\\nMagnificent to make the model for a palace that was to be built at\\nNaples; and he spent a long time over executing it. Now while he was\\nworking at this, the Castellan of Ostia, then Bishop della Rovere,\\nwho after a time became Pope Julius II, wishing to restore that\\nstronghold and to put it into good order, and having heard the fame\\nof Giuliano, sent to Florence for him; and, having supplied him with\\na good provision, he kept him employed for two years in making\\ntherein all the useful improvements that he was able to execute by\\nmeans of his art. And to the end that the model for the Duke of\\nCalabria might not be neglected, but might be brought to conclusion,\\nhe left it to his brother Antonio, who finished it according to his\\ndirections, which, in executing it and carrying it to completion, he\\nfollowed with great diligence, for he was no less competent in that\\nart than Giuliano himself. Now Giuliano was advised by the elder\\nLorenzo to present it in person, to the end that he might show from\\nthe model itself the difficulties that he had triumphed over in\\nmaking it. Whereupon he departed for Naples, and, having presented\\nthe work, was received with honour; for men were as much impressed\\nby the gracious manner in which the Magnificent Lorenzo had sent\\nhim, as they were struck with marvel at the masterly work in the\\nmodel, which gave such satisfaction that the building was\\nstraightway begun near the Castel Nuovo.\\n\\nAfter Giuliano had been some time in Naples, he sought leave from\\nthe Duke to return to Florence; whereupon he was presented by the\\nKing with horses and garments, and, among other things, with a\\nsilver cup containing some hundreds of ducats. These things Giuliano\\nwould not accept, saying that he served a patron who had no need of\\nsilver or gold, but that if he did indeed wish to give him some\\npresent or some token of approbation, to show that he had been in\\nthat city, he might bestow upon him some of his antiquities, which\\nhe would choose himself. These the King granted to him most\\nliberally, both for love of the Magnificent Lorenzo and on account\\nof Giuliano\\'s own worth; and they were a head of the Emperor\\nHadrian, which is now above the door of the garden at the house of\\nthe Medici, a nude woman, more than life-size, and a Cupid sleeping,\\nall in marble and in the round. Giuliano sent them as presents to\\nthe Magnificent Lorenzo, who expressed vast delight at the gift, and\\nnever tired of praising the action of this most liberal of\\ncraftsmen, who had refused gold and silver for the sake of art, a\\nthing which few would have done. That Cupid is now in the guardaroba\\nof Duke Cosimo.\\n\\n\\n\\nHaving then returned to Florence, Giuliano was received most\\ngraciously by the Magnificent Lorenzo. Now the fancy had taken that\\nPrince to build a convent capable of holding a hundred friars,\\nwithout the Porta S. Gallo, in order to give satisfaction to Fra\\nMariano da Ghinazzano, a most learned member of the Order of Eremite\\nFriars of S. Augustine. For this convent models were made by many\\narchitects, and in the end that of Giuliano was put into execution,\\nwhich was the reason that Lorenzo, from this work, gave him the name\\nof Giuliano da San Gallo. Wherefore Giuliano, who heard himself\\ncalled by everyone \"da San Gallo,\" said one day in jest to the\\nMagnificent Lorenzo, \"By giving me this new name of \\'da San Gallo,\\'\\nyou are making me lose the ancient name of my house, so that, in\\nplace of going forward in the matter of lineage, as I thought to do,\\nI am going backward.\" Whereupon Lorenzo answered that he would\\nrather have him become the founder of a new house through his own\\nworth, than depend on others; at which Giuliano was well content.\\n\\nMeanwhile the work of S. Gallo was carried on, together with\\nLorenzo\\'s other buildings; but neither the convent nor the others\\nwere finished, by reason of the death of Lorenzo. And even the\\ncompleted part of this structure of S. Gallo did not long remain\\nstanding, because in 1530, on account of the siege of Florence, it\\nwas destroyed and thrown to the ground, together with the whole\\nsuburb, the piazza of which was completely surrounded by very\\nbeautiful buildings; and at the present day there is no trace to be\\nseen there of house, church, or convent.\\n\\nAt this time there took place the death of the King of Naples,\\nwhereupon Giuliano Gondi, a very rich Florentine merchant, returned\\nfrom that city to Florence, and commissioned Giuliano da San Gallo,\\nwith whom he had become very intimate on account of his visit to\\nNaples, to build him a palace in rustic work, opposite to S.\\nFirenze, above the place where the lions used to be. This palace was\\nto form the angle of the piazza and to face the old Mercatanzia; but\\nthe death of Giuliano Gondi put a stop to the work. In it, among\\nother things, Giuliano made a chimney-piece, very rich in carvings,\\nand so varied and beautiful in composition, that up to that time\\nthere had never been seen the like, nor one with such a wealth of\\nfigures. The same master made a palace for a Venetian in Camerata,\\nwithout the Porta a Pinti, and many houses for private citizens, of\\nwhich there is no need to make mention.\\n\\nLorenzo the Magnificent, in order to benefit the commonwealth and\\nadorn the State, and at the same time to leave behind him some\\nsplendid monument, in addition to the endless number that he had\\nalready erected, wished to execute the fortification of the Poggio\\nImperiale, above Poggibonsi, on the road to Rome, with a view to\\nfounding a city there; and he would not lay it out without the\\nadvice and design of Giuliano. Wherefore that master began that most\\nfamous structure, in which he made the well-designed and beautiful\\nrange of fortifications that we see at the present day.\\n\\nThese works brought him such fame, that he was then summoned to\\nMilan, through the mediation of Lorenzo, by the Duke of Milan, to\\nthe end that he might make for him the model of a palace; and there\\nGiuliano was no less honoured by the Duke than he had previously\\nbeen honoured by the King of Naples, when that Sovereign had invited\\nhim to that city. For when he had presented the model to him, on\\nthe part of the Magnificent Lorenzo, the Duke was filled with\\nastonishment and marvel at seeing the vast number of beautiful\\nadornments in it, so well arranged and distributed, and all\\naccommodated in their places with art and grace; for which reason\\nall the materials necessary for the work were got together, and they\\nbegan to put it into execution. In the same city, together with\\nGiuliano, was Leonardo da Vinci, who was working for the Duke; and\\nLeonardo, speaking with Giuliano about the casting of the horse that\\nhe was proposing to make, received from him some excellent\\nsuggestions. This work was broken to pieces on the arrival of the\\nFrench, so that the horse was never finished; nor could the palace\\nbe brought to completion.\\n\\nHaving returned to Florence, Giuliano found that his brother\\nAntonio, who worked for him on his models, had become so excellent,\\nthat there was no one in his day who was a better master in carving,\\nparticularly for large Crucifixes of wood; to which witness is borne\\nby the one over the high-altar of the Nunziata in Florence, by\\nanother that is kept by the Friars of S. Gallo in S. Jacopo tra\\nFossi, and by a third in the Company of the Scalzo, which are all\\nheld to be very good. But Giuliano removed him from that profession\\nand caused him to give his attention to architecture, in company\\nwith himself, since he had many works to execute, both public and\\nprivate.\\n\\nNow it happened, as it is always happening, that Fortune, the enemy\\nof talent, robbed the followers of the arts of their hope and\\nsupport by the death of Lorenzo de\\' Medici, which was a heavy loss\\nnot only to all able craftsmen and to his country, but also to all\\nItaly. Wherefore Giuliano, together with all the other lofty\\nspirits, was left wholly inconsolable; and in his grief he betook\\nhimself to Prato, near Florence, in order to build the Temple of the\\nMadonna delle Carcere, since all building in Florence, both public\\nand private, was at a standstill. He lived in Prato, therefore,\\nthree whole years, supporting the expense, discomfort, and sorrow as\\nbest he could.\\n\\nAt the end of that time, it being proposed to roof the Church of the\\nMadonna at Loreto, and to raise the cupola, which had been formerly\\nbegun but not finished by Giuliano da Maiano, and those who had\\ncharge of the matter doubting that the piers were too weak to bear\\nsuch a weight, they wrote, therefore, to Giuliano, that if he\\ndesired such a work, he should go and see it for himself. And having\\ngone, like the bold and able man that he was, he showed them that\\nthe cupola could be raised with ease, and that he had courage enough\\nfor the task; and so many, and of such a kind, were the reasons that\\nhe put before them, that the work was allotted to him. After\\nreceiving this commission, he caused the work in Prato to be\\ndespatched, and made his way, with the same master-builders and\\nstone-cutters, to Loreto. And to the end that this structure,\\nbesides beauty of form, might be firm, solid, stable, and well bound\\nin the stonework, he sent to Rome for pozzolana; nor was any\\nlime used that was not mixed with it, nor any stone built in without\\nit; and thus, within the space of three years, it was brought to\\nperfect completion, ready for use.\\n\\nGiuliano then went to Rome, where, for Pope Alexander VI, he\\nrestored the roof of S. Maria Maggiore, which was falling into ruin;\\nand he made there the ceiling that is to be seen at the present day.\\nWhile he was thus employed about the Court, Bishop della Rovere, who\\nhad been the friend of Giuliano from the time when he was Castellan\\nof Ostia, and who had been created Cardinal of S. Pietro in Vincula,\\ncaused him to make a model for the Palace of S. Pietro in Vincula.\\nAnd a little time after, desiring to build a palace in his own city\\nof Savona, he wished to have it erected likewise from the design and\\nunder the eye of Giuliano. But such a journey was difficult for\\nGiuliano, for the reason that his ceiling was not yet finished, and\\nPope Alexander would not let him go. He entrusted the finishing of\\nit, therefore, to his brother Antonio, who, having a good and\\nversatile intelligence, and coming thus into contact with the Court,\\nentered into the service of the Pope, who conceived a very great\\naffection for him; and this he proved when he resolved to restore,\\nwith new foundations and with defences after the manner of a castle,\\nthe Mausoleum of Hadrian, now called the Castello di S. Angelo, for\\nAntonio was made overseer of this undertaking, and under his\\ndirection were made the great towers below, the ditches, and the\\nrest of the fortifications that we see at the present day. This work\\nbrought him great credit with the Pope, and with his son, Duke\\nValentino; and it led to his building the fortress that is now to be\\nseen at Cività Castellana. Thus, then, while that Pontiff was alive,\\nhe was continually employed in building; and while working for him,\\nhe was rewarded by him no less than he was esteemed.\\n\\nGiuliano had already carried well forward the work at Savona, when\\nthe Cardinal returned to Rome on some business of his own, leaving\\nmany workmen to bring the building to completion after the\\ndirections and design of Giuliano, whom he took with him to Rome.\\nGiuliano made that journey willingly, wishing to see Antonio and his\\nworks; and he stayed there some months. During that time, however,\\nthe Cardinal fell into disgrace with the Pope, and departed from\\nRome, in order not to be taken prisoner, and Giuliano, as before,\\nwent in his company. On arriving at Savona, they set a much greater\\nnumber of master-builders and other artificers to work on the\\nbuilding. But the threats of the Pope against the Cardinal becoming\\nevery day louder, it was not long before he made his way to Avignon.\\nFrom there he sent as a present to the King of France a model for a\\npalace that Giuliano had made for him, which was marvellous, very\\nrich in ornament, and spacious enough for the accommodation of his\\nwhole Court. The royal Court was at Lyons when Giuliano presented\\nhis model; and the gift was so welcome and acceptable to the King,\\nthat he rewarded Giuliano liberally and gave him infinite praise,\\nbesides rendering many thanks for it to the Cardinal, who was at\\nAvignon.\\n\\nMeanwhile they received news that the palace at Savona was already\\nnearly finished; whereupon the Cardinal determined that Giuliano\\nshould once more see the work, and Giuliano, having gone for this\\npurpose to Savona, had not been there long when it was completely\\nfinished. Then, desiring to return to Florence, where he had not\\nbeen for a long time, Giuliano took the road for that city together\\nwith his master-builders. Now at that time the King of France had\\nrestored Pisa her liberty, and the war between the Florentines and\\nthe Pisans was still raging; and Giuliano, wishing to pass through\\nPisan territory, had a safe-conduct made out for his company at\\nLucca, for they had no small apprehension about the Pisan soldiers.\\nNevertheless, while passing near Altopascio, they were captured by\\nthe Pisans, who cared nothing for safe-conducts or for any other\\nwarrant that they might have. And for six months Giuliano was\\ndetained in Pisa, his ransom being fixed at three hundred ducats;\\nnor was he able to return to Florence until he had paid it.\\n\\nAntonio had heard this news in Rome, and, desiring to see his native\\ncity and his brother again, obtained leave to depart from Rome; and\\non his way he designed for Duke Valentino the fortress of\\nMontefiascone. Finally, in the year 1503, he reached Florence, where\\nthe two brothers and their friends took joyful pleasure in each\\nother\\'s company.\\n\\nThere now ensued the death of Alexander VI, and the election of Pius\\nIII, who lived but a short time; whereupon the Cardinal of S. Pietro\\nin Vincula was created Pontiff, under the name of Pope Julius II;\\nwhich brought great joy to Giuliano, on account of his having been\\nso long in his service, and he determined, therefore, to go to kiss\\nthe Pope\\'s foot. Having then arrived in Rome, he was warmly received\\nand welcomed lovingly, and was straightway commissioned to execute\\nthe first buildings undertaken by that Pope before the coming of\\nBramante.\\n\\nAntonio, who had remained in Florence, continued, in the absence of\\nGiuliano (Piero Soderini being Gonfalonier), the building of the\\nPoggio Imperiale, to which all the Pisan prisoners were sent to\\nlabour, in order to finish the work the quicker. After this, by\\nreason of the troubles at Arezzo, the old fortress was destroyed,\\nand Antonio made the model for the new one, with the consent of\\nGiuliano, who had come from Rome for this purpose, but soon returned\\nthither; and this work was the reason that Antonio was appointed\\narchitect to the Commune of Florence for all the fortifications.\\n\\nOn the return of Giuliano to Rome, the question was being debated as\\nto whether the divine Michelagnolo Buonarroti should make the tomb\\nof Pope Julius; whereupon Giuliano exhorted the Pope to pursue that\\nundertaking, adding that it seemed to him that it was necessary to\\nbuild a special chapel for such a monument, and that it should not\\nbe placed in the old S. Pietro, in which there was no space for it,\\nwhereas a new chapel would bring out all the perfection of the work.\\nAfter many architects, then, had made designs, the matter little by\\nlittle became one of such importance, that, in place of erecting a\\nchapel, a beginning was made with the great fabric of the new S.\\nPietro. There had arrived in Rome, about that time, the architect\\nBramante of Castel Durante, who had been in Lombardy; and he went to\\nwork in such a manner, with various extraordinary means and methods\\nof his own, and with his fantastic ideas, having on his side\\nBaldassarre Peruzzi, Raffaello da Urbino, and other architects, that\\nhe put the whole undertaking into confusion; whereby much time was\\nconsumed in discussions. Finally--so well did he know how to set\\nabout the matter--the work was entrusted to him, as the man who had\\nshown the finest judgment, the best intelligence, and the greatest\\ninvention.\\n\\nGiuliano, resenting this, for it appeared to him that he had\\nreceived an affront from the Pope, in view of the faithful service\\nthat he had rendered to him when his rank was not so high, and of\\nthe promise made to him by the Pope that he should have that\\nbuilding, sought leave to go; and so, notwithstanding that he was\\nappointed companion to Bramante for other edifices that were being\\nerected in Rome, he departed, and returned, with many gifts received\\nfrom that Pontiff, to Florence.\\n\\nThis was a great joy to Piero Soderini, who straightway set him to\\nwork. Nor had six months gone by, when Messer Bartolommeo della\\nRovere, the nephew of the Pope, and a friend of Giuliano, wrote to\\nhim in the name of his Holiness that he should return for his own\\nadvantage to Rome; but neither terms nor promises availed to move\\nGiuliano, who considered that he had been put to shame by the Pope.\\nFinally, however, a letter was written to Piero Soderini, urging him\\nin one way or another to send Giuliano to Rome, since his Holiness\\nwished to finish the fortifications of the Great Round Tower, which\\nhad been begun by Nicholas V, and likewise those of the Borgo and\\nthe Belvedere, with other works; and Giuliano allowed himself to be\\npersuaded by Soderini, and therefore went to Rome, where he received\\na gracious welcome and many gifts from the Pope.\\n\\nHaving afterwards gone to Bologna, from which the Bentivogli had\\njust been driven out, the Pope resolved, by the advice of Giuliano,\\nto have a figure of himself in bronze made by Michelagnolo\\nBuonarroti; and this was carried out, as will be related in the Life\\nof Michelagnolo himself. Giuliano also followed the Pope to\\nMirandola, and after it was taken, having endured much fatigue and\\nmany discomforts, he returned with the Court to Rome. But the\\nfurious desire to drive the French out of Italy not having yet got\\nout of the head of the Pope, he strove to wrest the government of\\nFlorence out of the hands of Piero Soderini, whose power was no\\nsmall hindrance to him in the project that he had in mind.\\nWhereupon, since the Pontiff, for these reasons, had turned aside\\nfrom building and had embroiled himself in wars, Giuliano, by this\\ntime weary, and perceiving that attention was being given only to\\nthe construction of S. Pietro, and not much even to that, sought\\nleave from him to depart. But the Pope answered him in anger, \"Do\\nyou believe that you are the only Giuliano da San Gallo to be\\nfound?\" To which he replied that none could be found equal to him in\\nfaithful service, while he himself would easily find Princes truer\\nto their promises than the Pope had been towards him. However, the\\nPontiff would by no means give him leave to go, saying that he would\\nspeak to him about it another time.\\n\\nMeanwhile Bramante, having brought Raffaello da Urbino to Rome, set\\nhim to work at painting the Papal apartments; whereupon Giuliano,\\nperceiving that the Pope took great delight in those pictures, and\\nknowing that he wished to have the ceiling of the chapel of his\\nuncle Sixtus painted, spoke to him of Michelagnolo, adding that he\\nhad already executed the bronze statue in Bologna. Which news\\npleased the Pope so much that he sent for Michelagnolo, who, on\\narriving in Rome, received the commission for the ceiling of that\\nchapel.\\n\\nA little time after this, Giuliano coming back once more to seek\\nleave from the Pope to depart, his Holiness, seeing him determined\\non this, was content that he should return to Florence, without\\nforfeiting his favour; and, after having blessed him, he gave him a\\npurse of red satin containing five hundred crowns, telling him that\\nhe might return home to rest, but that he would always be his\\nfriend. Giuliano, then, having kissed the sacred foot, returned to\\nFlorence, at the very time when Pisa was surrounded and besieged by\\nthe army of Florence. No sooner had he arrived, therefore, than\\nPiero Soderini, after the due greetings, sent him to the camp to\\nhelp the military commissaries, who had found themselves unable to\\nprevent the Pisans from passing provisions into Pisa by way of the\\nArno. Giuliano made a design for a bridge of boats to be built at\\nsome better season, and then went back to Florence; and when spring\\nhad come, taking with him his brother Antonio, he made his way to\\nPisa, where they constructed a bridge, which was a very ingenious\\npiece of work, since, besides the fact that, rising or falling with\\nthe water, and being well bound with chains, it stood safe and sound\\nagainst floods, it carried out the desires of the commissaries in\\nsuch a manner, cutting off Pisa from access to the sea by way of the\\nArno, that the Pisans, having no other expedient in their sore\\nstraits, were forced to come to terms with the Florentines; and so\\nthey surrendered. Nor was it long before the same Piero Soderini\\nagain sent Giuliano, with a vast number of master-builders, to Pisa,\\nwhere with extraordinary swiftness he erected the fortress that\\nstill stands at the Porta a S. Marco, and also the gate itself,\\nwhich he built in the Doric Order. And the while that Giuliano was\\nengaged on this work, which was until the year 1512, Antonio went\\nthrough the whole dominion, inspecting and restoring the fortresses\\nand other public buildings.\\n\\nAfter this, by the favour of the same Pope Julius, the house of\\nMedici was reinstated in the government of Florence, from which they\\nhad been driven out on the invasion of Italy by Charles VIII, King\\nof France, and Piero Soderini was expelled from the Palace; and the\\nMedici showed their gratitude to Giuliano and Antonio for the\\nservices that they had rendered in the past to their illustrious\\nfamily. Now Cardinal Giovanni de\\' Medici having been elected Pope a\\nshort time after the death of Julius II, Giuliano was forced once\\nagain to betake himself to Rome; where, Bramante dying not long\\nafter his arrival, it was proposed to give to Giuliano the charge of\\nthe building of S. Pietro. But he, being worn out by his labours,\\nand crushed down by old age and by the stone, which made his life a\\nburden, returned by leave of his Holiness to Florence; and that\\ncommission was given to the most gracious Raffaello da Urbino. And\\nGiuliano, after two years, was pressed so sorely by his malady, that\\nhe died at the age of seventy-four in the year 1517, leaving his\\nname to the world, his body to the earth, and his soul to God.\\n\\nBy his departure he left a heavy burden of sorrow to his brother\\nAntonio, who loved him tenderly, and to a son of his own named\\nFrancesco, who was engaged in sculpture, although he was still quite\\nyoung. This Francesco, who has preserved up to our own day all the\\ntreasures of his elders, and holds them in veneration, executed many\\nworks at Florence and elsewhere, both in sculpture and in\\narchitecture, and by his hand is the Madonna of marble, with the\\nChild in her arms, and lying in the lap of S. Anne, that is in\\nOrsanmichele; which work, with the figures carved in the round out\\nof one single block, was held, as it still is, to be very beautiful.\\nHe has also executed the tomb that Pope Clement caused to be made\\nfor Piero de\\' Medici at Monte Cassino, besides many other works, of\\nwhich no mention is here made because the said Francesco is still\\nalive.\\n\\nAfter the death of Giuliano, Antonio, being a man who was not\\nwilling to stay idle, made two large Crucifixes of wood, one of\\nwhich was sent into Spain, while the other, by order of the\\nVice-Chancellor, Cardinal Giulio de\\' Medici, was taken by Domenico\\nBuoninsegni into France. It being then proposed to build the\\nfortress of Livorno, Antonio was sent thither by Cardinal de\\' Medici\\nto make the design for it; which he did, although it was afterwards\\nnot carried completely into execution, nor even after the method\\nsuggested by Antonio. After this, the men of Montepulciano\\ndetermining, by reason of the miracles wrought by an image of Our\\nLady, to build a temple for it at very great cost, Antonio made the\\nmodel for this, and became head of the undertaking; on which account\\nhe visited that building twice a year. At the present day it is to\\nbe seen carried to perfect completion, having been executed with\\nsupreme grace, and with truly marvellous beauty and variety of\\ncomposition, by the genius of Antonio, and all the masonry is of a\\ncertain stone that has a tinge of white, after the manner of\\ntravertine. It stands without the Porta di S. Biagio, on the right\\nhand, half-way up the slope of the hill. At this time, he made a\\nbeginning with a palace in the township of Monte San Sovino, for\\nAntonio di Monte, Cardinal of Santa Prassedia; and he built another\\nfor the same man at Montepulciano, both being executed and finished\\nwith extraordinary grace.\\n\\nHe made the design for the side of the buildings of the Servite\\nFriars (in Florence), on their Piazza, following the order of the\\nLoggia of the Innocenti; and at Arezzo he made models for the aisles\\nof the Madonna delle Lacrime, although that work was very badly\\nconceived, because it is out of harmony with the original part of\\nthe building, and the arches at the ends are not in true line with\\nthe centre. He also made a model for the Madonna of Cortona; but I\\ndo not think that this was put into execution. He was employed in\\nthe siege on the bastions and fortifications within the city, and in\\nthis undertaking he had as a companion his nephew Francesco. After\\nthis, the Giant of the Piazza, executed by the hand of Michelagnolo,\\nhaving been set into place in the time of Giuliano, the brother of\\nour Antonio, it was proposed to set up the other, which had been\\nmade by Baccio Bandinelli; and the task of bringing it safely into\\nposition was given to Antonio, who, taking Baccio d\\' Agnolo as his\\ncompanion, carried this out by means of very powerful machines, and\\nplaced it in safety on the base that had been prepared for that\\npurpose.\\n\\nIn the end, having become old, he took no pleasure in anything save\\nagriculture, of which he had an excellent knowledge. And then, when\\non account of old age he was no longer able to bear the discomforts\\nof this world, he rendered up his soul to God, in the year 1534, and\\nwas laid to rest by the side of his brother Giuliano in the tomb of\\nthe Giamberti, in the Church of S. Maria Novella.\\n\\nThe marvellous works of these two brothers will bear witness before\\nthe world to the extraordinary genius that they possessed; and for\\ntheir lives, their honourable ways, and their every action, they\\nwere held in estimation by all men. Giuliano and Antonio bequeathed\\nto the art of architecture methods that gave the Tuscan Order of\\nbuilding better form than any other architect had yet achieved, and\\nthe Doric Order they enriched with better measures and proportions\\nthan their predecessors, following the rules and canons of\\nVitruvius, had been wont to use. They collected in their houses at\\nFlorence an infinite number of most beautiful antiquities in marble,\\nwhich adorned Florence, and still adorn her, no less than those\\nmasters honoured themselves and their art. Giuliano brought from\\nRome the method of casting vaults with such materials as made them\\nready carved; examples of which may be seen in a room in his own\\nhouse, and in the vaulting of the Great Hall at Poggio a Cajano,\\nwhich is still to be seen there. Wherefore we should acknowledge our\\nobligation to their labours, whereby they fortified the dominion of\\nFlorence, adorned the city, and gave a name, throughout the many\\nregions where they worked, to Florence and to the intellects of\\nTuscany, who, to honour their memory, have written to them these\\nverses--\\n\\n  Cedite Romani structores, cedite Graii,\\n    Artis, Vitruvi, tu quoque cede parens.\\n  Etruscos celebrare viros, testudinis arcus,\\n    Urna, tholus, statuæ, templa, domusque petunt.\\n\\n\\nRAFFAELLO DA URBINO\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " \" OF RAFFAELLO DA URBINO\\n\\n[_RAFFAELLO SANZIO_]\\n\\nPAINTER AND ARCHITECT\\n\\n\\nHow bountiful and benign Heaven sometimes shows itself in showering\\nupon one single person the infinite riches of its treasures, and all\\nthose graces and rarest gifts that it is wont to distribute among\\nmany individuals, over a long space of time, could be clearly seen\\nin the no less excellent than gracious Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino,\\nwho was endowed by nature with all that modesty and goodness which\\nare seen at times in those who, beyond all other men, have added to\\ntheir natural sweetness and gentleness the beautiful adornment of\\ncourtesy and grace, by reason of which they always show themselves\\nagreeable and pleasant to every sort of person and in all their\\nactions. Him nature presented to the world, when, vanquished by art\\nthrough the hands of Michelagnolo Buonarroti, she wished to be\\nvanquished, in Raffaello, by art and character together. And in\\ntruth, since the greater part of the craftsmen who had lived up to\\nthat time had received from nature a certain element of savagery and\\nmadness, which, besides making them strange and eccentric, had\\nbrought it about that very often there was revealed in them rather\\nthe obscure darkness of vice than the brightness and splendour of\\nthose virtues that make men immortal, there was right good reason\\nfor her to cause to shine out brilliantly in Raffaello, as a\\ncontrast to the others, all the rarest qualities of the mind,\\naccompanied by such grace, industry, beauty, modesty, and excellence\\nof character, as would have sufficed to efface any vice, however\\nhideous, and any blot, were it ever so great. Wherefore it may be\\nsurely said that those who are the possessors of such rare and\\nnumerous gifts as were seen in Raffaello da Urbino, are not merely\\nmen, but, if it be not a sin to say it, mortal gods; and that those\\nwho, by means of their works, leave an honourable name written in\\nthe archives of fame in this earthly world of ours, can also hope to\\nhave to enjoy in Heaven a worthy reward for their labours and\\nmerits.\\n\\n\\n\\nRaffaello was born at Urbino, a very famous city in Italy, at three\\no'clock of the night on Good Friday, in the year 1483, to a father\\nnamed Giovanni de' Santi, a painter of no great excellence, and yet\\na man of good intelligence, well able to direct his children on that\\ngood path which he himself had not been fortunate enough to have\\nshown to him in his boyhood. And since Giovanni knew how important\\nit is to rear infants, not with the milk of nurses, but with that of\\ntheir own mothers, no sooner was Raffaello born, to whom with happy\\naugury he gave that name at baptism, than he insisted that this his\\nonly child--and he had no more afterwards--should be suckled by his\\nown mother, and that in his tender years he should have his\\ncharacter formed in the house of his parents, rather than learn less\\ngentle or even boorish ways and habits in the houses of peasants or\\ncommon people. When he was well grown, he began to exercise him in\\npainting, seeing him much inclined to such an art, and possessed of\\na very beautiful genius: wherefore not many years passed before\\nRaffaello, still a boy, became a great help to Giovanni in many\\nworks that he executed in the state of Urbino. In the end, this good\\nand loving father, knowing that his son could learn little from him,\\nmade up his mind to place him with Pietro Perugino, who, as he heard\\ntell, held the first place among painters at that time. He went,\\ntherefore, to Perugia: but not finding Pietro there, he set himself,\\nin order to lessen the annoyance of waiting for him, to execute some\\nworks in S. Francesco. When Pietro had returned from Rome, Giovanni,\\nwho was a gentle and well-bred person, formed a friendship with him,\\nand, when the time appeared to have come, in the most adroit method\\nthat he knew, told him his desire. And so Pietro, who was very\\ncourteous and a lover of beautiful genius, agreed to have Raffaello:\\nwhereupon Giovanni, going off rejoicing to Urbino, took the boy, not\\nwithout many tears on the part of his mother, who loved him dearly,\\nand brought him to Perugia, where Pietro, after seeing Raffaello's\\nmethod of drawing, and his beautiful manners and character,\\nformed a judgment of him which time, from the result, proved to be\\nvery true.\\n\\nIt is a very notable thing that Raffaello, studying the manner of\\nPietro, imitated it in every respect so closely, that his copies\\ncould not be distinguished from his master's originals, and it was\\nnot possible to see any clear difference between his works and\\nPietro's; as is still evident from some figures in a panel in S.\\nFrancesco at Perugia, which he executed in oils for Madonna\\nMaddalena degli Oddi. These are a Madonna who has risen into Heaven,\\nwith Jesus Christ crowning her, while below, round the sepulchre,\\nare the twelve Apostles, contemplating the Celestial Glory, and at\\nthe foot of the panel is a predella divided into three scenes,\\npainted with little figures, of the Madonna receiving the\\nAnnunciation from the Angel, of the Magi adoring Christ, and of\\nChrist in the arms of Simeon in the Temple. This work is executed\\nwith truly supreme diligence; and one who had not a good knowledge\\nof the two manners, would hold it as certain that it is by the hand\\nof Pietro, whereas it is without a doubt by the hand of Raffaello.\\n\\nAfter this work, Pietro returning to Florence on some business of\\nhis own, Raffaello departed from Perugia and went off with some\\nfriends to Città di Castello, where he painted a panel for S.\\nAgostino in the same manner, and likewise one of a Crucifixion for\\nS. Domenico, which, if his name were not written upon it, no one\\nwould believe to be a work by Raffaello, but rather by Pietro. For\\nS. Francesco, also in the same city, he painted a little\\npanel-picture of the Marriage of Our Lady, in which one may\\nrecognize the excellence of Raffaello increasing and growing in\\nrefinement, and surpassing the manner of Pietro. In this work is a\\ntemple drawn in perspective with such loving care, that it is a\\nmarvellous thing to see the difficulties that he was for ever\\nseeking out in this branch of his profession.\\n\\nMeanwhile, when he had acquired very great fame by following his\\nmaster's manner, Pope Pius II had given the commission for\\npainting the library of the Duomo at Siena to Pinturicchio; and he,\\nbeing a friend of Raffaello, and knowing him to be an excellent\\ndraughtsman, brought him to Siena, where Raffaello made for him some\\nof the drawings and cartoons for that work. The reason that he did\\nnot continue at it was that some painters in Siena kept extolling\\nwith vast praise the cartoon that Leonardo da Vinci had made in the\\nSala del Papa of a very beautiful group of horsemen, to be\\npainted afterwards in the Hall of the Palace of the Signoria, and\\nlikewise some nudes executed by Michelagnolo Buonarroti in\\ncompetition with Leonardo, and much better; and Raffaello, on\\naccount of the love that he always bore to the excellent in art, was\\nseized by such a desire to see them, that, putting aside that work\\nand all thought of his own advantage and comfort, he went off to\\nFlorence.\\n\\nHaving arrived there, and being pleased no less with the city than\\nwith those works, which appeared to him to be divine, he determined\\nto take up his abode there for some time; and thus he formed a\\nfriendship with some young painters, among whom were Ridolfo\\nGhirlandajo, Aristotile da San Gallo, and others, and became much\\nhonoured in that city, particularly by Taddeo Taddei, who, being one\\nwho always loved any man inclined to excellence, would have him ever\\nin his house and at his table. And Raffaello, who was gentleness\\nitself, in order not to be beaten in courtesy, made him two\\npictures, which incline to his first manner, derived from Pietro,\\nbut also to the other much better manner that he afterwards acquired\\nby study, as will be related; which pictures are still in the house\\nof the heirs of the said Taddeo.\\n\\n\\n\\nRaffaello also formed a very great friendship with Lorenzo Nasi; and\\nfor this Lorenzo, who had taken a wife about that time, he painted a\\npicture in which he made a Madonna, and between her legs her Son, to\\nwhom a little S. John, full of joy, is offering a bird, with great\\ndelight and pleasure for both of them. In the attitude of each is a\\ncertain childlike simplicity which is wholly lovely, besides that\\nthey are so well coloured, and executed with such diligence, that\\nthey appear to be rather of living flesh than wrought by means of\\ncolour and draughtsmanship; the Madonna, likewise, has an air truly\\nfull of grace and divinity; and the foreground, the landscapes, and\\nin short all the rest of the work, are most beautiful. This\\npicture was held by Lorenzo Nasi, as long as he lived, in very great\\nveneration, both in memory of Raffaello, who had been so much his\\nfriend, and on account of the dignity and excellence of the work;\\nbut afterwards, on August 9, in the year 1548, it met an evil fate,\\nwhen, on account of the collapse of the hill of S. Giorgio, the\\nhouse of Lorenzo fell down, together with the ornate and beautiful\\nhouses of the heirs of Marco del Nero, and other neighbouring\\ndwellings. However, the pieces of the picture being found among the\\nfragments of the ruins, the son of Lorenzo, Battista, who was a great\\nlover of art, had them put together again as well as was possible.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter these works, Raffaello was forced to depart from Florence and\\ngo to Urbino, where, on account of the death of his mother and of\\nhis father Giovanni, all his affairs were in confusion. While he was\\nliving in Urbino, therefore, he painted for Guidobaldo da\\nMontefeltro, then Captain of the Florentines, two pictures of Our\\nLady, small but very beautiful, and in his second manner, which are\\nnow in the possession of the most illustrious and excellent\\nGuidobaldo, Duke of Urbino. For the same patron he painted a little\\npicture of Christ praying in the Garden, with the three Apostles\\nsleeping at some distance from Him. This painting is so highly\\nfinished, that a miniature could not be better, or in any way\\ndifferent; and after having been a long time in the possession of\\nFrancesco Maria, Duke of Urbino, it was then presented by the most\\nillustrious Signora Leonora, his consort, to the Venetians Don Paolo\\nGiustiniano and Don Pietro Quirini, hermits of the holy Hermitage of\\nCamaldoli, who afterwards placed it, as a relic and a very rare\\nthing, and, in a word, as a work by the hand of Raffaello da Urbino,\\nand also to honour the memory of that most illustrious lady, in the\\napartment of the Superior of that hermitage, where it is held in the\\nveneration that it deserves.\\n\\nHaving executed these works and settled his affairs, Raffaello\\nreturned to Perugia, where he painted a panel-picture of Our Lady,\\nS. John the Baptist, and S. Nicholas, for the Chapel of the Ansidei\\nin the Church of the Servite Friars. And in the Chapel of the\\nMadonna in S. Severo, a little monastery of the Order of Camaldoli,\\nin the same city, he painted in fresco a Christ in Glory, and a God\\nthe Father with angels round Him, and six saints seated, S.\\nBenedict, S. Romualdo, S. Laurence, S. Jerome, S. Mauro, and S.\\nPlacido, three on either side; and on this picture, which was held\\nat that time to be most beautiful for a work in fresco, he wrote his\\nname in large and very legible letters. In the same city, also, he\\nwas commissioned by the Nuns of S. Anthony of Padua to paint a\\npanel-picture of Our Lady, with Jesus Christ fully dressed, as it\\npleased those simple and venerable sisters, in her lap, and on\\neither side of the Madonna S. Peter, S. Paul, S. Cecilia, and S.\\nCatherine; to which two holy virgins he gave the sweetest and most\\nlovely expressions of countenance and the most beautifully varied\\nhead-dresses that are anywhere to be seen, which was a rare thing in\\nthose times. Above this panel, in a lunette, he painted a very\\nbeautiful God the Father, and in the predella of the altar three\\nscenes with little figures, of Christ praying in the Garden, bearing\\nthe Cross (wherein are some soldiers dragging Him along with most\\nbeautiful movements), and lying dead in the lap of His Mother. This\\nwork is truly marvellous and devout; and it is held in great\\nveneration by those nuns, and much extolled by all painters.\\n\\nI will not refrain from saying that it was recognized, after he had\\nbeen in Florence, that he changed and improved his manner so much,\\nfrom having seen many works by the hands of excellent masters, that\\nit had nothing to do with his earlier manner; indeed, the two might\\nhave belonged to different masters, one much more excellent than the\\nother in painting.\\n\\nBefore he departed from Perugia, Madonna Atalanta Baglioni besought\\nhim that he should consent to paint a panel for her chapel in the\\nChurch of S. Francesco; but since he was not able to meet her wishes\\nat that time, he promised her that, after returning from Florence,\\nwhither he was obliged to go on some affairs, he would not fail her.\\nAnd so, having come to Florence, where he applied himself with\\nincredible labour to the studies of his art, he made the cartoon for\\nthat chapel, with the intention of going, as he did, as soon as the\\noccasion might present itself, to put it into execution.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile he was thus staying in Florence, Agnolo Doni--who was very\\ncareful of his money in other things, but willing to spend it,\\nalthough still with the greatest possible economy, on works of\\npainting and sculpture, in which he much delighted--caused him to\\nmake portraits of himself and of his wife; and these may be seen,\\npainted in his new manner, in the possession of Giovan Battista, his\\nson, in the beautiful and most commodious house that the same Agnolo\\nbuilt on the Corso de' Tintori, near the Canto degli Alberti, in\\nFlorence. For Domenico Canigiani, also, he painted a picture of Our\\nLady, with the Child Jesus welcoming a little S. John brought to Him\\nby S. Elizabeth, who, as she holds him, is gazing with a most\\nanimated expression at a S. Joseph, who is standing with both his\\nhands leaning on a staff, and inclines his head towards her, as\\nthough praising the greatness of God and marvelling that she, so\\nadvanced in years, should have so young a child. And all appear to\\nbe amazed to see with how much feeling and reverence the two\\ncousins, for all their tender age, are caressing one another; not to\\nmention that every touch of colour in the heads, hands, and feet\\nseems to be living flesh rather than a tint laid on by a master of\\nthat art. This most noble picture is now in the possession of the\\nheirs of the said Domenico Canigiani, who hold it in the estimation\\nthat is due to a work by Raffaello da Urbino.\\n\\nThis most excellent of painters studied in the city of Florence the\\nold works of Masaccio; and what he saw in those of Leonardo and\\nMichelagnolo made him give even greater attention to his studies, in\\nconsequence of which he effected an extraordinary improvement in his\\nart and manner. While he was living in Florence, Raffaello, besides\\nother friendships, became very intimate with Fra Bartolommeo di San\\nMarco, being much pleased with his colouring, and taking no little\\npains to imitate it: and in return he taught that good father the\\nprinciples of perspective, to which up to that time the monk had not\\ngiven any attention.\\n\\nBut at the very height of this friendly intercourse, Raffaello was\\nrecalled to Perugia, where he began by finishing the work for the\\naforesaid Madonna Atalanta Baglioni in S. Francesco, for which, as\\nhas been related, he had made the cartoon in Florence. In this most\\ndivine picture there is a Dead Christ being borne to the Sepulchre,\\nexecuted with such freshness and such loving care, that it seems to\\nthe eye to have been only just painted. In the composition of this\\nwork, Raffaello imagined to himself the sorrow that the nearest and\\nmost affectionate relatives of the dead one feel in laying to rest\\nthe body of him who has been their best beloved, and on whom, in\\ntruth, the happiness, honour, and welfare of a whole family have\\ndepended. Our Lady is seen in a swoon; and the heads of all the\\nfigures are very gracious in their weeping, particularly that of S.\\nJohn, who, with his hands clasped, bows his head in such a manner as\\nto move the hardest heart to pity. And in truth, whoever considers\\nthe diligence, love, art, and grace shown by this picture, has great\\nreason to marvel, for it amazes all who behold it, what with the air\\nof the figures, the beauty of the draperies, and, in short, the\\nsupreme excellence that it reveals in every part.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis work finished, he returned to Florence, where he received from\\nthe Dei, citizens of that city, the commission for an altar-panel\\nthat was to be placed in their chapel in S. Spirito; and he began\\nit, and brought the sketch very nearly to completion. At the same\\ntime he painted a picture that was afterwards sent to Siena,\\nalthough, on the departure of Raffaello, it was left with Ridolfo\\nGhirlandajo, to the end that he might finish a piece of blue drapery\\nthat was wanting. This happened because Bramante da Urbino, who was\\nin the service of Julius II, wrote to Raffaello, on account of his\\nbeing distantly related to him and also his compatriot, that he had\\nso wrought upon the Pope, who had caused some new rooms to be made\\n(in the Vatican), that Raffaello would have a chance of showing his\\nworth in them. This proposal pleased Raffaello: wherefore,\\nabandoning his works in Florence, and leaving the panel for the Dei\\nunfinished, in the state in which Messer Baldassarre da Pescia had\\nit placed in the Pieve of his native city after the death of\\nRaffaello, he betook himself to Rome. Having arrived there, he found\\nthat most of the rooms in the Palace had been painted, or were still\\nbeing painted, by a number of masters. To be precise, he saw that\\nthere was one room in which a scene had been finished by Piero della\\nFrancesca; Luca da Cortona had brought one wall nearly to\\ncompletion; and Don Pietro della Gatta, Abbot of S. Clemente\\nat Arezzo, had begun some works there. Bramantino, the Milanese, had\\nlikewise painted many figures, which were mostly portraits from\\nlife, and were held to be very beautiful. After his arrival,\\ntherefore, having been received very warmly by Pope Julius,\\nRaffaello began in the Camera della Segnatura a scene of the\\ntheologians reconciling Philosophy and Astrology with Theology:\\nwherein are portraits of all the sages in the world, disputing in\\nvarious ways. Standing apart are some astrologers, who have made\\nvarious kinds of figures and characters of geomancy and astrology on\\nsome little tablets, which they send to the Evangelists by certain\\nvery beautiful angels; and these Evangelists are expounding them.\\nAmong them is Diogenes with his cup, lying on the steps, and lost in\\nthought, a figure very well conceived, which, for its beauty and the\\ncharacteristic negligence of its dress, is worthy to be extolled.\\nThere, also, are Aristotle and Plato, one with the Timæus in his\\nhand, the other with the Ethics; and round them, in a circle, is a\\ngreat school of philosophers. Nor is it possible to express the\\nbeauty of those astrologers and geometricians who are drawing a vast\\nnumber of figures and characters with compasses on tablets: among\\nwhom, in the figure of a young man, shapely and handsome, who is\\nthrowing out his arms in admiration, and inclining his head, is the\\nportrait of Federigo II, Duke of Mantua, who was then in Rome. There\\nis also a figure that is stooping to the ground, holding in its hand\\na pair of compasses, with which it is making a circle on a tablet:\\nthis is said to be the architect Bramante, and it is no less the man\\nhimself than if he were alive, so well is it drawn. Beside a figure\\nwith its back turned and holding a globe of the heavens in its hand,\\nis the portrait of Zoroaster; and next to him is Raffaello, the\\nmaster of the work, who made his own portrait by means of a mirror,\\nin a youthful head with an air of great modesty, filled with a\\npleasing and excellent grace, and wearing a black cap.\\n\\nNor is one able to describe the beauty and goodness that are to be\\nseen in the heads and figures of the Evangelists, to whose\\ncountenances he gave an air of attention and intentness very true to\\nlife, and particularly in those who are writing. Thus, behind S.\\nMatthew, who is copying the characters from the tablet wherein are\\nthe figures (which is held before him by an angel), and writing them\\ndown in a book, he painted an old man who, having placed a piece of\\npaper on his knee, is copying all that S. Matthew writes down; and\\nwhile intent on his work in that uncomfortable position, he seems to\\ntwist his head and his jaws in time with the motion of the pen. And\\nin addition to the details of the conceptions, which are numerous\\nenough, there is the composition of the whole scene, which is truly\\narranged with so much order and proportion, that he may be said to\\nhave given therein such a proof of his powers as made men understand\\nthat he was resolved to hold the sovereignty, without question,\\namong all who handled the brush.\\n\\nHe also adorned this work with a view in perspective and with many\\nfigures, executed in such a sweet and delicate manner, that Pope\\nJulius was induced thereby to cause all the scenes of the other\\nmasters, both the old and the new, to be thrown to the ground, so\\nthat Raffaello alone might have the glory of all the labours that\\nhad been devoted to these works up to that time. The work of\\nGiovanni Antonio Sodoma of Vercelli, which was above Raffaello's\\npainting, was to be thrown down by order of the Pope; but Raffaello\\ndetermined to make use of its compartments and grotesques. There\\nwere also some medallions, four in number, and in each of these he\\nmade a figure as a symbol of the scenes below, each figure being on\\nthe same side as the scene that it represented. Over the first\\nscene, wherein he painted Philosophy, Astrology, Geometry, and\\nPoetry making peace with Theology, is a woman representing\\nKnowledge, who is seated on a throne that is supported on either\\nside by a figure of the Goddess Cybele, each with those many breasts\\nwhich in ancient times were the attributes of Diana Polymastes; and\\nher dress is of four colours, standing for the four elements; from\\nthe head downwards there is the colour of fire, below the girdle\\nthat of the sky, from the groin to the knees there is the colour of\\nearth, and the rest, down to the feet, is the colour of water. With\\nher, also, are some truly beautiful little boys. In another\\nmedallion, on the side towards the window that looks over the\\nBelvedere, is a figure of Poetry, who is in the form of Polyhymnia,\\ncrowned with laurel, and holds an antique musical instrument in one\\nhand, and a book in the other, and has her legs crossed. With a more\\nthan human beauty of expression in her countenance, she stands with\\nher eyes uplifted towards Heaven, accompanied by two little boys,\\nwho are lively and spirited, and who make a group of beautiful\\nvariety both with her and with the others. On this side, over the\\naforesaid window, Raffaello afterwards painted Mount Parnassus. In\\nthe third medallion, which is above the scene where the Holy Doctors\\nare ordaining the Mass, is a figure of Theology, no less beautiful\\nthan the others, with books and other things round her, and likewise\\naccompanied by little boys. And in the fourth medallion, over the\\nother window, which looks out on the court, he painted Justice with\\nher scales, and her sword uplifted, and with the same little boys\\nthat are with the others; of which the effect is supremely\\nbeautiful, for in the scene on the wall below he depicted the giving\\nof the Civil and the Canon Law, as we will relate in the proper\\nplace.\\n\\nIn like manner, on the same ceiling, in the angles of the\\npendentives, he executed four scenes which he drew and coloured with\\ngreat diligence, but with figures of no great size. In one of these,\\nthat near the Theology, he painted the Sin of Adam, the eating of\\nthe apple, which he executed with a most delicate manner; and in the\\nsecond, near the Astrology, is a figure of that science setting the\\nfixed stars and planets in their places. In the next, that belonging\\nto Mount Parnassus, is Marsyas, whom Apollo has caused to be bound\\nto a tree and flayed; and on the side of the scene wherein the\\nDecretals are given, there is the Judgment of Solomon, showing him\\nproposing to have the child cut in half. These four scenes are all\\nfull of expression and feeling, and executed with excellent\\ndraughtsmanship, and with pleasing and gracious colouring.\\n\\nBut now, having finished with the vaulting--that is, the ceiling--of\\nthat apartment, it remains for us to describe what he painted below\\nthe things mentioned above, wall by wall. On the wall towards the\\nBelvedere, where there are Mount Parnassus and the Fount of Helicon,\\nhe made round that mount a laurel wood of darkest shadows, in the\\nverdure of which one almost sees the leaves quivering in the gentle\\nzephyrs; and in the air are vast numbers of naked Loves, most\\nbeautiful in feature and expression, who are plucking branches of\\nlaurel and with them making garlands, which they throw and scatter\\nabout the mount. Over the whole, in truth, there seems to breathe a\\nspirit of divinity, so beautiful are the figures, and such the\\nnobility of the picture, which makes whoever studies it with\\nattention marvel how a human brain, by the imperfect means of mere\\ncolours, and by excellence of draughtsmanship, could make painted\\nthings appear alive. Most lifelike, also, are those Poets who are\\nseen here and there about the mount, some standing, some seated,\\nsome writing, and others discoursing, and others, again, singing or\\nconversing together, in groups of four or six, according as it\\npleased him to distribute them. There are portraits from nature of\\nall the most famous poets, ancient and modern, and some only just\\ndead, or still living in his day; which were taken from statues or\\nmedals, and many from old pictures, and some, who were still alive,\\nportrayed from the life by himself. And to begin with one end, there\\nare Ovid, Virgil, Ennius, Tibullus, Catullus, Propertius, and Homer;\\nthe last-named, blind and chanting his verses with uplifted head,\\nhaving at his feet one who is writing them down. Next, in a group,\\nare all the nine Muses and Apollo, with such beauty in their aspect,\\nand such divinity in the figures, that they breathe out a spirit of\\ngrace and life. There, also, are the learned Sappho, the most divine\\nDante, the gracious Petrarca, and the amorous Boccaccio, who are\\nwholly alive, with Tibaldeo, and an endless number of other moderns;\\nand this scene is composed with much grace, and executed with\\ndiligence.\\n\\nOn another wall he made a Heaven, with Christ, Our Lady, S. John the\\nBaptist, the Apostles, the Evangelists, and the Martyrs, enthroned\\non clouds, with God the Father sending down the Holy Spirit over\\nthem all, and particularly over an endless number of saints, who are\\nbelow, writing the Mass, and engaged in disputation about the Host,\\nwhich is on the altar. Among these are the four Doctors of the\\nChurch, who have about them a vast number of saints, such as\\nDominic, Francis, Thomas Aquinas, Buonaventura, Scotus, and Nicholas\\nof Lira, with Dante, Fra Girolamo Savonarola of Ferrara, and all the\\nChristian theologians, with an infinite number of portraits from\\nnature; and in the air are four little children, who are holding\\nopen the Gospels. Anything more graceful or more perfect than these\\nfigures no painter could create, since those saints are represented\\nas seated in the air, in a circle, and so well, that in truth,\\nbesides the appearance of life that the colouring gives them, they\\nare foreshortened and made to recede in such a manner, that they\\nwould not be otherwise if they were in relief. Moreover, their\\nvestments show a rich variety, with most beautiful folds in the\\ndraperies, and the expressions of the heads are more Divine than\\nhuman; as may be seen in that of Christ, which reveals all the\\nclemency and devoutness that Divinity can show to mortal men through\\nthe medium of painting. For Raffaello received from nature a\\nparticular gift of making the expressions of his heads very sweet\\nand gracious; of which we have proof also in the Madonna, who, with\\nher hands pressed to her bosom, gazing in contemplation upon her\\nSon, seems incapable of refusing any favour; not to mention that he\\nshowed a truly beautiful sense of fitness, giving a look of age to\\nthe expressions of the Holy Patriarchs, simplicity to the Apostles,\\nand faith to the Martyrs. Even more art and genius did he display in\\nthe holy Christian Doctors, in whose features, while they make\\ndisputation throughout the scene in groups of six or three or two,\\nthere may be seen a kind of eagerness and distress in seeking to\\nfind the truth of that which is in question, revealing this by\\ngesticulating with their hands, making various movements of their\\npersons, turning their ears to listen, knitting their brows, and\\nexpressing astonishment in many different ways, all truly well\\nvaried and appropriate; save only the four Doctors of the Church,\\nwho, illumined by the Holy Spirit, are unravelling and expounding,\\nby means of the Holy Scriptures, all the problems of the Gospels,\\nwhich are held up by those little boys who have them in their hands\\nas they hover in the air.\\n\\nOn another wall, where the other window is, on one side, he painted\\nJustinian giving the Laws to the Doctors to be revised; and above\\nthis, Temperance, Fortitude, and Prudence. On the other side he\\npainted the Pope giving the Canonical Decretals; for which Pope he\\nmade a portrait from life of Pope Julius, and, beside him, Cardinal\\nGiovanni de' Medici, who became Pope Leo, Cardinal Antonio di Monte,\\nand Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, who afterwards became Pope Paul\\nIII, with other portraits.\\n\\nThe Pope was very well satisfied with this work; and in order to\\nmake the panelling worthy of the paintings, he sent to Monte Oliveto\\ndi Chiusuri, a place in the territory of Siena, for Fra Giovanni da\\nVerona, a great master at that time of perspective-views in inlaid\\nwoodwork, who made there not only the panelling right round, but\\nalso very beautiful doors and seats, wrought with perspective-views,\\nwhich brought him great favour, rewards, and honour from the Pope.\\nAnd it is certain that in that craft there was never any man more\\nable than Giovanni, either in design or in workmanship: of which we\\nstill have proof in the Sacristy, wrought most beautifully with\\nperspective-views in woodwork, of S. Maria in Organo in his native\\ncity of Verona, in the choir of Monte Oliveto di Chiusuri and that\\nof S. Benedetto at Siena, in the Sacristy of Monte Oliveto at\\nNaples, and also in the choir of the Chapel of Paolo da Tolosa in\\nthe same place, executed by that master. Wherefore he well deserved\\nto be esteemed and held in very great honour by the convent of his\\nOrder, in which he died at the age of sixty-eight, in the year 1537.\\nOf him, as of a person truly excellent and rare, I have thought it\\nright to make mention, believing that this was due to his talents,\\nwhich, as will be related in another place, led to many beautiful\\nworks being made by other masters after him.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut to return to Raffaello; his powers grew in such a manner, that\\nhe was commissioned by the Pope to go on to paint a second room,\\nthat near the Great Hall. And at this time, when he had gained a\\nvery great name, he also made a portrait of Pope Julius in a picture\\nin oils, so true and so lifelike, that the portrait caused all who\\nsaw it to tremble, as if it had been the living man himself. This\\nwork is now in S. Maria del Popolo, together with a very beautiful\\npicture of Our Lady, painted at the same time by the same master,\\nand containing the Nativity of Jesus Christ, wherein is the Virgin\\nlaying a veil over her Son, whose beauty is such, both in the air of\\nthe head and in all the members, as to show that He is the true Son\\nof God. And no less beautiful than the Child is the Madonna, in\\nwhom, besides her supreme loveliness, there may be seen piety and\\ngladness. There is also a Joseph, who, leaning with both his hands\\non a staff, and lost in thoughtful contemplation of the King and\\nQueen of Heaven, gazes with the adoration of a most saintly old man.\\nBoth these pictures are exhibited on days of solemn festival.\\n\\nBy this time Raffaello had acquired much fame in Rome; but, although\\nhis manner was graceful and held by all to be very beautiful, and\\ndespite the fact that he had seen so many antiquities in that city,\\nand was for ever studying, nevertheless he had not yet given thereby\\nto his figures that grandeur and majesty which he gave to them from\\nthat time onward. For it happened in those days that Michelagnolo\\nmade the terrifying outburst against the Pope in the chapel, of\\nwhich we will speak in his Life; whence he was forced to fly to\\nFlorence. Whereupon Bramante, having the keys of the chapel, allowed\\nRaffaello, who was his friend, to see it, to the end that he might\\nbe able to learn the methods of Michelagnolo. And the sight of it\\nwas the reason that Raffaello straightway repainted, although he had\\nalready finished it, the Prophet Isaiah that is to be seen in S.\\nAgostino at Rome, above the S. Anne by Andrea Sansovino; in which\\nwork, by means of what he had seen of Michelagnolo's painting, he\\nmade the manner immeasurably better and more grand, and gave it\\ngreater majesty. Wherefore Michelagnolo, on seeing afterwards the\\nwork of Raffaello, thought, as was the truth, that Bramante had done\\nhim that wrong on purpose in order to bring profit and fame to\\nRaffaello.\\n\\nNot long after this, Agostino Chigi, a very rich merchant of Siena,\\nwho was much the friend of every man of excellence, gave Raffaello\\nthe commission to paint a chapel; and this he did because a short\\ntime before Raffaello had painted for him in his softest manner, in\\na loggia of his palace, now called the Chigi, in the Trastevere, a\\nGalatea in a car on the sea drawn by two dolphins, and surrounded by\\nTritons and many sea-gods. Raffaello, then, having made the cartoon\\nfor that chapel, which is at the entrance of the Church of S. Maria\\ndella Pace, on the right hand as one goes into the church by the\\nprincipal door, executed it in fresco, in his new manner, which was\\nno little grander and more magnificent than his earlier manner. In\\nthis painting Raffaello depicted some Prophets and Sibyls, before\\nMichelagnolo's chapel had been thrown open to view, although he had\\nseen it; and in truth it is held to be the best of his works, and\\nthe most beautiful among so many that are beautiful, for in the\\nwomen and children that are in it, there may be seen a marvellous\\nvivacity and perfect colouring. And this work caused him to be\\ngreatly esteemed both in his lifetime and after his death, being the\\nrarest and most excellent that Raffaello executed in all his life.\\n\\nNext, spurred by the entreaties of a Chamberlain of Pope Julius, he\\npainted the panel for the high-altar of the Araceli, wherein he made\\na Madonna in the sky, with a most beautiful landscape, a S. John, a\\nS. Francis, and a S. Jerome represented as a Cardinal; in which\\nMadonna may be seen a humility and a modesty truly worthy of the\\nMother of Christ; and besides the beautiful gesture of the Child as\\nHe plays with His Mother's hand, there is revealed in S. John that\\npenitential air which fasting generally gives, while his head\\ndisplays the sincerity of soul and frank assurance appropriate to\\nthose who live away from the world and despise it, and, in their\\ndealings with mankind, make war on falsehood and speak out the\\ntruth. In like manner, the S. Jerome has his head uplifted with his\\neyes on the Madonna, deep in contemplation; and in them seem to be\\nsuggested all the learning and knowledge that he showed in his\\nwritings, while with both his hands he is presenting the\\nChamberlain, in the act of recommending him to her; which portrait\\nof the Chamberlain is as lifelike as any ever painted. Nor did\\nRaffaello fail to do as well in the figure of S. Francis, who,\\nkneeling on the ground, with one arm outstretched, and with his head\\nupraised, is gazing up at the Madonna, glowing with a love in tone\\nwith the feeling of the picture, which, both by the lineaments and\\nby the colouring, shows him melting with affection, and taking\\ncomfort and life from the gracious sight of her beauty and of the\\nvivacity and beauty of her Son. In the middle of the panel, below\\nthe Madonna, Raffaello made a little boy standing, who is raising\\nhis head towards her and holding an inscription: than whom none\\nbetter or more graceful could be painted, what with the beauty of\\nhis features and the proportionate loveliness of his person. And in\\naddition there is a landscape, which is singularly beautiful in its\\nabsolute perfection.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfterwards, going on with the apartments of the Palace, he painted a\\nscene of the Miracle of the Sacramental Corporal of Orvieto, or of\\nBolsena, whichever it may be called. In this scene there may be\\nperceived in the face of the priest who is saying Mass, which is\\nglowing with a blush, the shame that he felt on seeing the Host\\nturned into blood on the Corporal on account of his unbelief. With\\nterror in his eyes, dumbfoundered and beside himself in the presence\\nof his hearers, he seems like one who knows not what to do; and in\\nthe gesture of his hands may almost be seen the fear and trembling\\nthat a man would feel in such a case. Round him Raffaello made many\\nfigures, all varied and different, some serving the Mass, others\\nkneeling on a flight of steps; and all, bewildered by the\\nstrangeness of the event, are making various most beautiful\\nmovements and gestures, while in many, both men and women, there is\\nrevealed a belief that they are to blame. Among the women is one who\\nis seated on the ground at the foot of the scene, holding a child in\\nher arms; and she, hearing the account that another appears to be\\ngiving her of the thing that has happened to the priest, turns in a\\nmarvellous manner as she listens to this, with a womanly grace that\\nis very natural and lifelike. On the other side he painted Pope\\nJulius hearing that Mass, a most marvellous work, wherein he made a\\nportrait of Cardinal di San Giorgio, with innumerable others; and\\nthe window-opening he turned to advantage by making a flight of\\nsteps, in such a way that all the painting seems to be one whole:\\nnay, it appears as if, were that window-space not there, the work\\nwould in nowise have been complete. Wherefore it may be truly\\ncredited to him that in the invention and composition of every kind\\nof painted story, no one has ever been more dexterous, facile, and\\nable than Raffaello.\\n\\nThis he also proved in another scene in the same place, opposite to\\nthe last-named, of S. Peter in the hands of Herod, and guarded in\\nprison by men-at-arms; wherein he showed such a grasp of\\narchitecture, and such judgment in the buildings of the prison, that\\nin truth the others after him seem to have more confusion than he\\nhas beauty. For he was ever seeking to represent stories just as\\nthey are written, and to paint in them things gracious and\\nexcellent; as is proved in this one by the horror of the prison,\\nwherein that old man is seen bound in chains of iron between the two\\nmen-at-arms, by the deep slumber of the guards, and by the dazzling\\nsplendour of the Angel, which, in the thick darkness of the night,\\nreveals with its light every detail of the prison, and makes the\\narms of the soldiers shine resplendent, in such a way that their\\nburnished lustre seems more lifelike than if they were real,\\nalthough they are only painted. No less art and genius are there in\\nthe action of S. Peter, when, freed from his chains, he goes forth\\nfrom the prison, accompanied by the Angel, wherein one sees in the\\nface of the Saint a belief that it is rather a dream than a reality;\\nand so, also, terror and dismay are shown in some other armed guards\\nwithout the prison, who hear the noise of the iron door, while a\\nsentinel with a torch in his hand rouses the others, and, as he\\ngives them light with it, the blaze of the torch is reflected in all\\ntheir armour; and all that its glow does not reach is illumined by\\nthe light of the moon. This composition Raffaello painted over the\\nwindow, where the wall is darkest; and thus, when you look at the\\npicture, the light strikes you in the face, and the real light\\nconflicts so well with the different lights of the night in the\\npainting, that the smoke of the torch, the splendour of the Angel,\\nand the thick darkness of the night seem to you to be wholly real\\nand natural, and you would never say that it was all painted, so\\nvividly did he express this difficult conception. In it are seen\\nshadows playing on the armour, other shadows projected, reflections,\\nand a vaporous glare from the lights, all executed with darkest\\nshade, and so well, that it may be truly said that he was the master\\nof every other master; and as an effect of night, among all those\\nthat painting has ever produced, this is the most real and most\\ndivine, and is held by all the world to be the rarest.\\n\\nOn one of the unbroken walls, also, he painted the Divine Worship\\nand the Ark of the Hebrews, with the Candlestick; and likewise Pope\\nJulius driving Avarice out of the Temple, a scene as beautiful and\\nas excellent as the Night described above. Here, in some bearers who\\nare carrying Pope Julius, a most lifelike figure, in his chair, are\\nportraits of men who were living at that time. And while the people,\\nsome women among them, are making way for the Pope, so that he may\\npass, one sees the furious onset of an armed man on horseback, who,\\naccompanied by two on foot, and in an attitude of the greatest\\nfierceness, is smiting and riding down the proud Heliodorus, who is\\nseeking, at the command of Antiochus, to rob the Temple of all the\\nwealth stored for the widows and orphans. Already the riches and\\ntreasures could be seen being removed and taken away, when, on\\naccount of the terror of the strange misfortune of Heliodorus, so\\nrudely struck down and smitten by the three figures mentioned above\\n(although, this being a vision, they are seen and heard by him\\nalone), behold, they are all dropped and upset on the ground, those\\nwho were carrying them falling down through the sudden terror and\\npanic that had come upon all the following of Heliodorus. Apart from\\nthese may be seen the holy Onias, the High Priest, dressed in his\\nrobes of office, with his eyes and hands raised to Heaven, and\\npraying most fervently, being seized with pity for the poor\\ninnocents who were thus nearly losing their possessions, and\\nrejoicing at the help that he feels has come down from on high.\\nBesides this, through a beautiful fancy of Raffaello's, one sees\\nmany who have climbed on to the socles of the column-bases, and,\\nclasping the shafts, stand looking in most uncomfortable attitudes;\\nwith a throng of people showing their amazement in many various\\nways, and awaiting the result of this event.\\n\\nThis work is in every part so stupendous, that even the cartoons are\\nheld in the greatest veneration; wherefore Messer Francesco Masini,\\na gentleman of Cesena--who, without the help of any master, but\\ngiving his attention by himself from his earliest childhood, guided\\nby an extraordinary instinct of nature, to drawing and painting, has\\npainted pictures that have been much extolled by good judges of\\nart--possesses, among his many drawings and some ancient reliefs in\\nmarble, certain pieces of the cartoon which Raffaello made for this\\nstory of Heliodorus, and he holds them in the estimation that they\\ntruly deserve. Nor will I refrain from saying that Messer Niccolò\\nMasini, who has given me information about these matters, is as much\\na true lover of our arts as he is a man of real culture in all other\\nthings.\\n\\nBut to return to Raffaello; on the ceiling above these works, he\\nthen executed four scenes, God appearing to Abraham and promising\\nhim the multiplication of his seed, the Sacrifice of Isaac, Jacob's\\nLadder, and the Burning Bush of Moses: wherein may be recognized no\\nless art, invention, draughtsmanship, and grace, than in the other\\nworks that he painted.\\n\\nWhile the happy genius of this craftsman was producing such marvels,\\nthe envy of fortune cut short the life of Julius II, who had\\nfostered such abilities, and had been a lover of every excellent\\nwork. Whereupon a new Pope was elected in Leo X, who desired that\\nthe work begun should be carried on; and Raffaello thereby soared\\nwith his genius into the heavens, and received endless favours from\\nhim, fortunate in having come upon a Prince so great, who had by the\\ninheritance of blood a strong inclination for such an art.\\nRaffaello, therefore, thus encouraged to pursue the work, painted on\\nthe other wall the Coming of Attila to Rome, and his encounter at\\nthe foot of Monte Mario with Leo III, who drove him away with his\\nmere benediction. In this scene Raffaello made S. Peter and S. Paul\\nin the air, with swords in their hands, coming to defend the Church;\\nand while the story of Leo III says nothing of this, nevertheless it\\nwas thus that he chose to represent it, perchance out of fancy, for\\nit often happens that painters, like poets, go straying from their\\nsubject in order to make their work the more ornate, although their\\ndigressions are not such as to be out of harmony with their first\\nintention. In those Apostles may be seen that celestial wrath and\\nardour which the Divine Justice is wont often to impart to the\\nfeatures of its ministers, charged with defending the most holy\\nFaith; and of this we have proof in Attila, who is to be seen riding\\na black horse with white feet and a star on its forehead, as\\nbeautiful as it could be, for in an attitude of the utmost terror he\\nthrows up his head and turns his body in flight. There are other\\nmost beautiful horses, particularly a dappled jennet, which is\\nridden by a figure that has all the body covered with scales after\\nthe manner of a fish; which is copied from the Column of Trajan,\\nwherein the figures have armour of that kind; and it is thought that\\nsuch armour is made from the skins of crocodiles. There is Monte\\nMario, all aflame, showing that when soldiers march away, their\\nquarters are always left a prey to fire. He made portraits from\\nnature, also, in some mace-bearers accompanying the Pope, who are\\nmarvellously lifelike, as are the horses on which they are riding;\\nand the same is true of the retinue of Cardinals, and of some grooms\\nwho are holding the palfrey on which rides the Pope in full\\npontificals (a portrait of Leo X, no less lifelike than those of the\\nothers), with many courtiers; the whole being a most pleasing\\nspectacle and well in keeping with such a work, and also very useful\\nto our art, particularly for those who have no such objects at their\\ncommand.\\n\\nAt this same time he painted a panel containing Our Lady, S. Jerome\\nrobed as a Cardinal, and an Angel Raphael accompanying Tobias, which\\nwas placed in S. Domenico at Naples, in that chapel wherein is the\\nCrucifix that spoke to S. Thomas Aquinas. For Signor Leonello da\\nCarpi, Lord of Meldola, who is still alive, although more than\\nninety years old, he executed a picture that was most marvellous in\\ncolouring, and of a singular beauty, for it is painted with such\\nforce, and also with a delicacy so pleasing, that I do not think it\\nis possible to do better. In the countenance of the Madonna may be\\nseen such a divine air, and in her attitude such a dignity, that no\\none would be able to improve her; and he made her with the hands\\nclasped, adoring her Son, who is seated on her knees, caressing a S.\\nJohn, a little boy, who is adoring Him, in company with S. Elizabeth\\nand Joseph. This picture was once in the possession of the very\\nreverend Cardinal da Carpi, the son of the said Signor Leonello, and\\na great lover of our arts; and it should be at the present day in\\nthe hands of his heirs.\\n\\nAfterwards, Lorenzo Pucci, Cardinal of Santi Quattro, having been\\ncreated Grand Penitentiary, Raffaello was favoured by him with a\\ncommission to paint a panel for S. Giovanni in Monte at Bologna,\\nwhich is now set up in the chapel wherein lies the body of the\\nBlessed Elena dall' Olio: in which work it is evident how much\\ngrace, in company with art, could accomplish by means of the\\ndelicate hands of Raffaello. In it is a S. Cecilia, who, entranced\\nby a choir of angels on high, stands listening to the sound, wholly\\nabsorbed in the harmony; and in her countenance is seen that\\nabstraction which is found in the faces of those who are in ecstasy.\\nScattered about the ground, moreover, are musical instruments, which\\nhave the appearance of being, not painted, but real and true; and\\nsuch, also, are some veils that she is wearing, with vestments woven\\nin silk and gold, and, below these, a marvellous hair-shirt. And in\\na S. Paul, who has the right arm leaning on his naked sword, and the\\nhead resting on the hand, one sees his profound air of knowledge, no\\nless well expressed than the transformation of his pride of aspect\\ninto dignity. He is clothed in a simple red garment by way of\\nmantle, below which is a green tunic, after the manner of the\\nApostles, and his feet are bare. There is also S. Mary Magdalene,\\nwho is holding in her hands a most delicate vase of stone, in an\\nattitude of marvellous grace; turning her head, she seems full of\\njoy at her conversion; and indeed, in that kind of painting, I do\\nnot think that anything better could be done. Very beautiful,\\nlikewise, are the heads of S. Augustine and S. John the Evangelist.\\nOf a truth, other pictures may be said to be pictures, but those of\\nRaffaello life itself, for in his figures the flesh quivers, the\\nvery breath may be perceived, the pulse beats, and the true\\npresentment of life is seen in them; on which account this picture\\ngave him, in addition to the fame that he had already, an even\\ngreater name. Wherefore many verses were written in his honour, both\\nLatin and in the vulgar tongue, of which, in order not to make my\\nstory longer than I have set out to do, I will cite only the\\nfollowing:\\n\\n  Pingant sola alii referantque coloribus ora;\\n  Cæciliæ os Raphael atque animum explicuit.\\n\\nAfter this he also painted a little picture with small figures,\\nwhich is likewise at Bologna, in the house of Count Vincenzio\\nErcolano, containing a Christ after the manner of Jove in Heaven,\\nsurrounded by the four Evangelists as Ezekiel describes them, one in\\nthe form of a man, another as a lion, the third an eagle, and the\\nfourth an ox, with a little landscape below to represent the earth:\\nwhich work, in its small proportions, is no less rare and beautiful\\nthan his others in their greatness.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo the Counts of Canossa in Verona he sent a large picture of equal\\nexcellence, in which is a very beautiful Nativity of Our Lord, with\\na daybreak that is much extolled, as is also the S. Anne, and,\\nindeed, the whole work, which cannot be more highly praised than by\\nsaying that it is by the hand of Raffaello da Urbino. Wherefore\\nthose Counts rightly hold it in supreme veneration, nor have they\\never consented, for all the vast prices that have been offered to\\nthem by many Princes, to sell it to anyone.\\n\\nFor Bindo Altoviti, he made a portrait of him when he was a young\\nman, which is held to be extraordinary; and likewise a picture of\\nOur Lady, which he sent to Florence, and which is now in the Palace\\nof Duke Cosimo, in the chapel of the new apartments, which were\\nbuilt and painted by me, where it serves as altar-piece. In it is\\npainted a very old S. Anne, seated, and holding out to Our Lady her\\nSon, the features of whose countenance, as well as the whole of His\\nnude form, are so beautiful that with His smile He rejoices whoever\\nbeholds Him; besides which, Raffaello depicted, in painting the\\nMadonna, all the beauty that can be imparted to the aspect of a\\nVirgin, with the complement of chaste humility in the eyes, honour\\nin the brow, grace in the nose, and virtue in the mouth; not to\\nmention that her raiment is such as to reveal infinite simplicity\\nand dignity. And, indeed, I do not think that there is anything\\nbetter to be seen than this whole work. There is a nude S. John,\\nseated, with a female saint, who is likewise very beautiful; and for\\nbackground there is a building, in which he painted a linen-covered\\nwindow that gives light to the room wherein are the figures.\\n\\nIn Rome he made a picture of good size, in which he portrayed Pope\\nLeo, Cardinal Giulio de' Medici, and Cardinal de' Rossi. In this the\\nfigures appear to be not painted, but in full relief; there is the\\npile of the velvet, with the damask of the Pope's vestments shining\\nand rustling, the fur of the linings soft and natural, and the gold\\nand silk so counterfeited that they do not seem to be in colour, but\\nreal gold and silk. There is an illuminated book of parchment, which\\nappears more real than the reality; and a little bell of wrought\\nsilver, which is more beautiful than words can tell. Among other\\nthings, also, is a ball of burnished gold on the Pope's chair,\\nwherein are reflected, as if it were a mirror (such is its\\nbrightness), the light from the windows, the shoulders of the Pope,\\nand the walls round the room. And all these things are executed with\\nsuch diligence, that one may believe without any manner of doubt\\nthat no master is able, or is ever likely to be able, to do better.\\nFor this work the Pope was pleased to reward him very richly; and\\nthe picture is still to be seen in Florence, in the guardaroba of\\nthe Duke. In like manner he executed portraits of Duke Lorenzo and\\nDuke Giuliano, with a perfect grace of colouring not achieved by any\\nother than himself, which are in the possession of the heirs of\\nOttaviano de' Medici at Florence.\\n\\nThereupon there came to Raffaello a great increase of glory, and\\nlikewise of rewards; and for this reason, in order to leave some\\nmemorial of himself, he caused a palace to be built in the Borgo\\nNuovo at Rome, which Bramante executed with castings. Now, the fame\\nof this most noble craftsman, by reason of the aforesaid works and\\nmany others, having passed into France and Flanders, Albrecht Dürer,\\na most marvellous German painter, and an engraver of very beautiful\\ncopperplates, rendered tribute to Raffaello out of his own works,\\nand sent to him a portrait of himself, a head, executed by him in\\ngouache on a cloth of fine linen, which showed the same on either\\nside, the lights being transparent and obtained without lead-white,\\nwhile the only grounding and colouring was done with water-colours,\\nthe white of the cloth serving for the ground of the bright parts.\\nThis work seemed to Raffaello to be marvellous, and he sent him,\\ntherefore, many drawings executed by his own hand, which were\\nreceived very gladly by Albrecht. That head was among the\\npossessions of Giulio Romano, the heir of Raffaello, in Mantua.\\n\\nRaffaello, having thus seen the manner of the engravings of Albrecht\\nDürer, and desiring on his own behalf to show what could be done\\nwith his work by such an art, caused Marc' Antonio Bolognese to make\\na very thorough study of the method; and that master became so\\nexcellent, that Raffaello commissioned him to make prints of his\\nfirst works, such as the drawing of the Innocents, a Last Supper,\\nthe Neptune, and the S. Cecilia being boiled in oil. Marc' Antonio\\nafterwards made for Raffaello a number of other engravings, which\\nRaffaello finally gave to Baviera, his assistant, who had charge of\\na mistress whom Raffaello loved to the day of his death. Of her he\\nmade a very beautiful portrait, wherein she seemed wholly alive: and\\nthis is now in Florence, in the possession of that most gentle of\\nmen, Matteo Botti, a Florentine merchant, and an intimate friend of\\nevery able person, and particularly of painters, who treasures it\\nas a relic, on account of the love that he bears to art, and above\\nall to Raffaello. And no less esteem is shown to the works of our\\narts and to the craftsmen by his brother, Simon Botti, who, besides\\nbeing held by us all to be one of the most loving spirits that show\\nfavour to the men of our professions, is held in estimation by me in\\nparticular as the best and greatest friend that ever man loved after\\na long experience; not to mention the good judgment that he has and\\nshows in matters of art.\\n\\nBut to return to the engravings; the favour shown by Raffaello to\\nBaviera was the reason that there afterwards sprang up Marco da\\nRavenna and a host of others, insomuch that the dearth of copper\\nengravings was changed into that abundance that we see at the\\npresent day. Thereupon Ugo da Carpi, having a brain inclined to\\ningenious and fanciful things, and showing beautiful invention,\\ndiscovered the method of wood-engraving, whereby, with three blocks,\\ngiving the middle values, the lights, and the shadows, it is\\npossible to imitate drawings in chiaroscuro, which was certainly a\\nthing of beautiful and fanciful invention; and from this, also,\\nthere afterwards came an abundance of prints, as will be related\\nwith greater detail in the Life of Marc' Antonio Bolognese.\\n\\nRaffaello then painted for the Monastery of the Monks of Monte\\nOliveto, called S. Maria dello Spasmo, at Palermo, a panel-picture\\nof Christ bearing the Cross, which is held to be a marvellous work.\\nIn this may be seen the impious ministers of the Crucifixion,\\nleading Him with wrath and fury to His death on Mount Calvary; and\\nChrist, broken with agony at the near approach of death, has fallen\\nto the ground under the weight of the Tree of the Cross, and, bathed\\nwith sweat and blood, turns towards the Maries, who are in a storm\\nof weeping. Moreover, there is seen among them Veronica, who\\nstretches out her arms and offers Him a cloth, with an expression of\\nthe tenderest love, not to mention that the work is full of\\nmen-at-arms both on horseback and on foot, who are pouring forth\\nfrom the gate of Jerusalem with the standards of justice in their\\nhands, in various most beautiful attitudes. This panel, when\\ncompletely finished, but not yet brought to its resting-place, was\\nvery near coming to an evil end, for the story goes that after it\\nhad been put on shipboard, in order that it might be carried to\\nPalermo, a terrible storm dashed against a rock the ship that was\\ncarrying it, in such a manner that the timbers broke asunder, and\\nall the men were lost, together with the merchandise, save only the\\npanel, which, safely packed in its case, was washed by the sea on to\\nthe shore of Genoa. There, having been fished up and drawn to land,\\nit was found to be a thing divine, and was put into safe keeping;\\nfor it had remained undamaged and without any hurt or blemish, since\\neven the fury of the winds and the waves of the sea had respect for\\nthe beauty of such a work. The news of this being then bruited\\nabroad, the monks took measures to recover it, and no sooner had it\\nbeen restored to them, by the favour of the Pope, than they gave\\nsatisfaction, and that liberally, to those who had rescued it.\\nThereupon it was once more put on board ship and brought at last to\\nSicily, where they set it up in Palermo; in which place it has more\\nfame and reputation than the Mount of Vulcan itself.\\n\\nWhile Raffaello was engaged on these works, which, having to gratify\\ngreat and distinguished persons, he could not refuse to\\nundertake--not to mention that his own private interests prevented\\nhim from saying them nay--yet for all this he never ceased to carry\\non the series of pictures that he had begun in the Papal apartments\\nand halls; wherein he always kept men who pursued the work from his\\nown designs, while he himself, continually supervising everything,\\nlent to so vast an enterprise the aid of the best efforts of which\\nhe was capable. No long time passed, therefore, before he threw open\\nthat apartment of the Borgia Tower in which he had painted a scene\\non every wall, two above the windows, and two others on the unbroken\\nwalls. In one was the Burning of the Borgo Vecchio of Rome, when,\\nall other methods having failed to put out the fire, S. Leo IV\\npresents himself at the Loggia of his Palace and extinguishes it\\ncompletely with his benediction. In this scene are represented\\nvarious perils. On one side are women who are bearing vessels filled\\nwith water in their hands and on their heads, whereby to extinguish\\nthe flames; and their hair and draperies are blown about by the\\nterrible fury of a tempestuous wind. Others, who are seeking to\\nthrow water on the fire, are blinded by the smoke and wholly\\nbewildered. On the other side, after the manner of Virgil's story\\nof Anchises being carried by Æneas, is shown an old sick man,\\novercome by his infirmity and the flames of the fire; and in the\\nfigure of the young man are seen courage and strength, and great\\neffort in all his limbs under the weight of the old man, who lies\\nhelpless on the young man's back. He is followed by an old woman\\nwith bare feet and disordered garments, who is flying from the fire;\\nand a little naked boy runs before them. On the top of some ruins,\\nlikewise, may be seen a naked woman, with hair all dishevelled, who\\nhas her child in her hands and is throwing him to a man of her\\nhouse, who, having escaped from the flames, is standing in the\\nstreet on tiptoe, with arms outstretched to receive the child\\nwrapped in swathing-bands; wherein the eager anxiety of the woman to\\nsave her son may be recognized no less clearly than her torment in\\nthe peril of the fierce flames, which are already licking around\\nher. And no less suffering is evident in him who is receiving the\\nchild, both for its sake and on account of his own fear of death.\\nNor is it possible to describe the imagination that this most\\ningenious and most marvellous craftsman showed in a mother with her\\nfeet bare, her garments in disorder, her girdle unbound, and her\\nhair dishevelled, who has gathered her children before her and is\\ndriving them on, holding part of her clothing in one hand, that they\\nmay escape from the ruins and from that blazing furnace; not to\\nmention that there are also some women who, kneeling before the\\nPope, appear to be praying to his Holiness that he should make the\\nfire cease.\\n\\nThe next scene is from the life of the same S. Leo IV, wherein\\nRaffaello depicted the port of Ostia occupied by the fleet of the\\nTurks, who had come to take the Pope prisoner. The Christians may be\\nseen fighting against that fleet on the sea; and already there has\\ncome to the harbour an endless number of prisoners, who are\\ndisembarking from a boat and being dragged by the beard by some\\nsoldiers, who are very beautiful in features and most spirited in\\ntheir attitudes. The prisoners, dressed in the motley garb of\\ngalley-slaves, are being led before S. Leo, whose figure is a\\nportrait of Pope Leo X. Here Raffaello painted his Holiness in\\npontificals, between Cardinal Santa Maria in Portico, who was\\nBernardo Divizio of Bibbiena, and Cardinal Giulio de' Medici, who\\nafterwards became Pope Clement. Nor is it possible to describe in\\ndetail the beautiful conceptions that this most ingenious craftsman\\nshowed in the expressions of the prisoners, wherein one can\\nrecognize, without speech, their grief and the fear of death.\\n\\nIn the first of the other two scenes is Pope Leo X consecrating the\\nmost Christian King, Francis I of France, chanting the Mass in his\\npontificals, and blessing the oil for the anointing of the King, and\\nlikewise the royal crown. There, besides the great number of\\nCardinals and Bishops in their robes, who are assisting, he\\nportrayed from life many Ambassadors and other persons, and also\\nsome figures dressed in the French fashion, according to the style\\nof that time. In the other scene he painted the Crowning of the same\\nKing, wherein are portraits from life of the Pope and of Francis,\\none in armour and the other in his pontificals; besides which, all\\nthe Cardinals, Bishops, Chamberlains, Esquires, and Grooms of the\\nChamber are seated in due order in their places, as is the custom in\\nthe chapel, all in their robes and portrayed from life, among them\\nbeing Giannozzo Pandolfini, Bishop of Troia, a close friend of\\nRaffaello, with many others who were distinguished at that time.\\nNear the King is a little boy kneeling, who is holding the royal\\ncrown--a portrait of Ippolito de' Medici, who afterwards became\\nCardinal and Vice-Chancellor, a man of great repute, and much the\\nfriend not only of this art, but of all others, to whose blessed\\nmemory I acknowledge a vast obligation, seeing that my first steps,\\nsuch as they were, were taken under his auspices.\\n\\nIt is not possible to write of every detail in the works of this\\ncraftsman, wherein every least thing, although dumb, appears to have\\nspeech: save only of the bases executed below these pictures, with\\nvarious figures of defenders and benefactors of the Church, and\\nvarious terminal figures on either side of them, the whole being\\nwrought in such a manner that everything reveals spirit, feeling,\\nand thought, and with such a harmony and unity of colouring that\\nnothing better can be conceived. And since the ceiling of that\\napartment had been painted by Pietro Perugino, his master, Raffaello\\nwould not destroy it, moved by respect for his memory and by the\\nlove that he bore to the man who had been the origin of the rank\\nthat he held in his art.\\n\\nSuch was the greatness of this master, that he kept designers all\\nover Italy, at Pozzuolo, and even in Greece; and he was for ever\\nsearching out everything of the good that might help his art.\\n\\nNow, continuing his work, he also painted a hall, wherein were some\\nfigures of the Apostles and other saints in tabernacles, executed in\\nterretta; and there he caused to be made by Giovanni da Udine, his\\ndisciple, who has no equal in the painting of animals, all the\\nanimals that Pope Leo possessed, such as the chameleon, the\\ncivet-cats, the apes, the parrots, the lions, the elephants, and\\nother beasts even more strange. And besides embellishing the Palace\\ngreatly with grotesques and varied pavements, he also gave the\\ndesigns for the Papal staircases, as well as for the loggie begun by\\nthe architect Bramante, but left unfinished on account of his death,\\nand afterwards carried out with the new design and architecture of\\nRaffaello, who made for this a model of wood with better proportion\\nand adornment than had been accomplished by Bramante. The Pope\\nwishing to demonstrate the greatness and magnificence of his\\ngenerous ambition, Raffaello made the designs for the ornaments in\\nstucco and for the scenes that were painted there, and likewise for\\nthe compartments; and as for the stucco and the grotesques, he\\nplaced at the head of that work Giovanni da Udine, and the figures\\nhe entrusted to Giulio Romano, although that master worked but\\nlittle at them; and he also employed Giovanni Francesco, Il Bologna,\\nPerino del Vaga, Pellegrino da Modena, Vincenzio da San Gimignano,\\nand Polidoro da Caravaggio, with many other painters, who executed\\nscenes and figures and other things that were required throughout\\nthat work, which Raffaello caused to be completed with such\\nperfection, that he even sent to Florence for pavements by the hand\\nof Luca della Robbia. Wherefore it is certain that with regard to\\nthe paintings, the stucco-ornaments, the arrangement, or any of the\\nbeautiful inventions, no one would be able to execute or even to\\nimagine a more marvellous work; and its beauty was the reason that\\nRaffaello received the charge of all the works of painting and\\narchitecture that were in progress in the Palace.\\n\\nIt is said that the courtesy of Raffaello was such that he prevailed\\nupon the masons, in order that he might accommodate his friends, not\\nto build the walls absolutely solid and unbroken, but to leave,\\nabove the old rooms below, various openings and spaces for the\\nstorage of barrels, flasks, and wood; which holes and spaces so\\nweakened the lower part of the masonry, that afterwards they had to\\nbe filled in, because the whole was beginning to show cracks. He\\ncommissioned Gian Barile to adorn all the doors and ceilings of\\nwoodwork with a good number of carvings, which he executed and\\nfinished with beautiful grace.\\n\\nHe gave architectural designs for the Vigna of the Pope, and for\\nmany houses in the Borgo; in particular, for the Palace of Messer\\nGiovanni Battista dall' Aquila, which was a very beautiful work. He\\nalso designed one for the Bishop of Troia, who had it built in the\\nVia di S. Gallo at Florence. For the Black Friars of S. Sisto in\\nPiacenza, he painted the picture for their high-altar, containing\\nthe Madonna with S. Sisto and S. Barbara, a truly rare and\\nextraordinary work. He executed many pictures to be sent into\\nFrance, and in particular, for the King, a S. Michael fighting with\\nthe Devil, which was held to be a marvellous thing. In this work he\\npainted a fire-scarred rock, to represent the centre of the earth,\\nfrom the fissures of which were issuing sulphurous flames; and in\\nLucifer, whose scorched and burned limbs are painted with various\\ntints of flesh-colour, could be seen all the shades of anger that\\nhis venomous and swollen pride calls up against Him who overbears\\nthe greatness of him who is deprived of any kingdom where there\\nmight be peace, and doomed to suffer perpetual punishment. The\\nopposite may be perceived in the S. Michael, clad in armour of iron\\nand gold, who, although he is painted with a celestial air, yet has\\nvalour, force, and terror in his aspect, and has already thrown\\nLucifer down and hurled him backwards with his spear. In a word,\\nthis work was of such a kind that he won for it, and rightly, a most\\nhonourable reward from that King. He made portraits of Beatrice of\\nFerrara and other ladies, and in particular that of his own\\nmistress, with an endless number of others.\\n\\nRaffaello was a very amorous person, delighting much in women, and\\never ready to serve them; which was the reason that, in the pursuit\\nof his carnal pleasures, he found his friends more complacent and\\nindulgent towards him than perchance was right. Wherefore, when his\\ndear friend Agostino Chigi commissioned him to paint the first\\nloggia in his palace, Raffaello was not able to give much attention\\nto his work, on account of the love that he had for his mistress; at\\nwhich Agostino fell into such despair, that he so contrived by means\\nof others, by himself, and in other ways, as to bring it about,\\nalthough only with difficulty, that this lady should come to live\\ncontinually with Raffaello in that part of the house where he was\\nworking; and in this manner the work was brought to completion. For\\nthis work he made all the cartoons, and he coloured many of the\\nfigures in fresco with his own hand. And on the ceiling he made the\\nCouncil of the Gods in Heaven, wherein, in the forms of the Gods,\\nare seen many vestments and lineaments copied from the antique, and\\nexecuted with very beautiful grace and draughtsmanship. In like\\nmanner he made the Marriage of Psyche, with ministers serving Jove,\\nand the Graces scattering flowers over the table. In the spandrels\\nof the vaulting he executed many scenes, in one of which is Mercury\\nwith his flute, who, as he flies, has all the appearance of\\ndescending from Heaven; and in another is Jove with an air of\\ncelestial dignity, kissing Ganymede; and in another, likewise, lower\\ndown, is the Car of Venus, and the Graces, with Mercury, drawing\\nPsyche up to Heaven; with many other scenes from the poets in the\\nother spandrels. And in the spherical triangles of the vaulting\\nabove the arches, between the spandrels, are many most beautiful\\nlittle boys in foreshortening, hovering in the air and carrying all\\nthe instruments of the gods; Jove's lightnings and thunderbolts, the\\nhelmet, sword, and shield of Mars, Vulcan's hammers, the club and\\nlion-skin of Hercules, the caduceus of Mercury, Pan's pipes, and the\\nagricultural rakes of Vertumnus. All are accompanied by animals\\nappropriate to their character; and the whole work, both as picture\\nand as poem, is truly beautiful. Round these scenes he caused\\nGiovanni da Udine to make a border of all kinds of flowers, foliage,\\nand fruits, in festoons, which are as beautiful as they could be.\\n\\nRaffaello made the designs for the architecture of the stables of\\nthe Chigi, and the design for the chapel of the aforesaid Agostino\\nin S. Maria del Popolo, wherein, besides painting it, he made\\narrangements for the erection of a marvellous tomb, causing\\nLorenzetto, a sculptor of Florence, to execute two figures, which\\nare still in his house in the Macello de' Corbi at Rome; but the\\ndeath of Raffaello, followed by that of Agostino, brought it about\\nthat this work was given to Sebastiano Viniziano.\\n\\nMeanwhile Raffaello had risen to such greatness, that Leo X ordained\\nthat he should set to work on the Great Hall on the upper floor,\\nwherein are the Victories of Constantine; and with this he made a\\nbeginning. A fancy likewise took the Pope to have some very rich\\ntapestries made in gold and floss-silk; whereupon Raffaello drew and\\ncoloured with his own hand, of the exact form and size, all the\\ncartoons, which were sent to Flanders to be woven; and the\\ntapestries, when finished, were brought to Rome. This work was\\nexecuted so marvellously, that it arouses astonishment in whoever\\nbeholds it, wondering how it could have been possible to weave the\\nhair and beards in such detail, and to give softness to the flesh\\nwith mere threads; and it is truly rather a miracle than the work of\\nhuman art, seeing that in these tapestries are animals, water, and\\nbuildings, all made in such a way that they seem to be not woven,\\nbut really wrought with the brush. The work cost 70,000 crowns, and\\nit is still preserved in the Papal Chapel.\\n\\nFor Cardinal Colonna he painted a S. John on canvas, for which, on\\naccount of its beauty, that Cardinal had an extraordinary love; but\\nhappening to be attacked by illness, he was asked by Messer Jacopo\\nda Carpi, the physician who cured him, to give it to him as a\\npresent; and because of this desire of Messer Jacopo, to whom he\\nfelt himself very deeply indebted, he gave it up. It is now in the\\npossession of Francesco Benintendi, in Florence.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor Giulio de' Medici, Cardinal and Vice-Chancellor, he painted a\\npanel-picture, to be sent into France, of the Transfiguration of\\nChrist, at which he laboured without ceasing, and brought it to the\\nhighest perfection with his own hand. In this scene he represented\\nChrist Transfigured on Mount Tabor, at the foot of which are the\\neleven Disciples awaiting Him. There may be seen a young man\\npossessed by a spirit, who has been brought thither in order that\\nChrist, after descending from the mountain, may deliver him; which\\nyoung man stretches himself out in a distorted attitude, crying\\nand rolling his eyes, and reveals his suffering in his flesh, his\\nveins, and the beat of his pulse, all infected by that malignant\\nspirit; and the colour of his flesh, as he makes those violent and\\nfearsome gestures, is very pale. This figure is supported by an old\\nman, who, having embraced him and taken heart, with his eyes wide\\nopen and the light shining in them, is raising his brows and\\nwrinkling his forehead, showing at one and the same time both\\nstrength and fear; gazing intently, however, at the Apostles, he\\nappears to be encouraging himself by trusting in them. Among many\\nwomen is one, the principal figure in that panel, who, having knelt\\ndown before the Apostles, and turning her head towards them,\\nstretches her arms in the direction of the maniac and points out his\\nmisery; besides which the Apostles, some standing, some seated, and\\nothers kneeling, show that they are moved to very great compassion\\nby such misfortune. And, indeed, he made therein figures and heads\\nso fine in their novelty and variety, to say nothing of their\\nextraordinary beauty, that it is the common opinion of all craftsmen\\nthat this work, among the vast number that he painted, is the most\\nglorious, the most lovely, and the most divine. For whoever wishes\\nto know how Christ Transfigured and made Divine should be\\nrepresented in painting, must look at this work, wherein Raffaello\\nmade Him in perspective over that mount, in a sky of exceeding\\nbrightness, with Moses and Elias, who, illumined by a dazzling\\nsplendour, burst into life in His light. Prostrate on the ground, in\\nattitudes of great beauty and variety, are Peter, James, and John;\\none has his head to the earth, and another, shading his eyes with\\nhis hands, is defending himself from the rays and intense light of\\nthe splendour of Christ. He, clothed in snow-white raiment, with His\\narms outstretched and His head raised, appears to reveal the Divine\\nessence and nature of all the Three Persons united and concentrated\\nin Himself by the perfect art of Raffaello, who seems to have\\nsummoned up all his powers in such a manner, in order to show the\\nsupreme force of his art in the countenance of Christ, that, after\\nfinishing this, the last work that he was to do, he never again\\ntouched a brush, being overtaken by death.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, having described the works of this most excellent craftsman,\\nbefore I come to relate other particulars of his life and death, I\\ndo not wish to grudge the labour of saying something, for the\\nbenefit of the men of our arts, about the various manners of\\nRaffaello. He, then, after having imitated in his boyhood the manner\\nof his master, Pietro Perugino, which he made much better in\\ndraughtsmanship, colouring, and invention, believed that he had done\\nenough; but he recognized, when he had reached a riper age, that he\\nwas still too far from the truth. For, after seeing the works of\\nLeonardo da Vinci, who had no peer in the expressions of heads both\\nof men and of women, and surpassed all other painters in giving\\ngrace and movement to his figures, he was left marvelling and\\namazed; and in a word, the manner of Leonardo pleasing him more than\\nany other that he had ever seen, he set himself to study it, and\\nabandoning little by little, although with great difficulty, the\\nmanner of Pietro, he sought to the best of his power and knowledge\\nto imitate that of Leonardo. But for all his diligence and study, in\\ncertain difficulties he was never able to surpass Leonardo; and\\nalthough it appears to many that he did surpass him in sweetness and\\nin a kind of natural facility, nevertheless he was by no means\\nsuperior to him in that sublime groundwork of conceptions and that\\ngrandeur of art in which few have been the peers of Leonardo. Yet\\nRaffaello came very near to him, more than any other painter, and\\nabove all in grace of colouring. But to return to Raffaello himself;\\nin time he found himself very much hindered and impeded by the\\nmanner that he had adopted from Pietro when he was quite young,\\nwhich he acquired with ease, since it was over-precise, dry, and\\nfeeble in draughtsmanship. His being unable to forget it was the\\nreason that he had great difficulty in learning the beauties of the\\nnude and the methods of difficult foreshortenings from the cartoon\\nthat Michelagnolo Buonarroti made for the Council Hall in Florence;\\nand another might have lost heart, believing that he had been\\npreviously wasting his time, and would never have achieved, however\\nlofty his genius, what Raffaello accomplished. But he, having purged\\nhimself of Pietro's manner, and having thoroughly freed himself of\\nit, in order to learn the manner of Michelagnolo, so full of\\ndifficulties in every part, was changed, as it were, from a master\\nonce again into a disciple; and he forced himself with incredible\\nstudy, when already a man, to do in a few months what might have\\ncalled for the tender age at which all things are best acquired, and\\nfor a space of many years. For in truth he who does not learn in\\ngood time right principles and the manner that he wishes to follow,\\nand does not proceed little by little to solve the difficulties of\\nthe arts by means of experience, seeking to understand every part,\\nand to put it into practice, can scarcely ever become perfect; and\\neven if he does, that can only be after a longer space of time and\\nmuch greater labour.\\n\\nWhen Raffaello resolved to set himself to change and improve his\\nmanner, he had never given his attention to nudes with that zealous\\nstudy which is necessary, and had only drawn them from life in the\\nmanner that he had seen practised by his master Pietro, imparting to\\nthem the grace that he had from nature. He then devoted himself to\\nstudying the nude and to comparing the muscles of anatomical subjects\\nand of flayed human bodies with those of the living, which, being\\ncovered with skin, are not clearly defined, as they are when the skin\\nhas been removed; and going on to observe in what way they acquire the\\nsoftness of flesh in the proper places, and how certain graceful\\nflexures are produced by changing the point of view, and also the\\neffect of inflating, lowering, or raising either a limb or the whole\\nperson, and likewise the concatenation of the bones, nerves, and\\nveins, he became excellent in all the points that are looked for in a\\npainter of eminence. Knowing, however, that in this respect he could\\nnever attain to the perfection of Michelagnolo, he reflected, like a\\nman of supreme judgment, that painting does not consist only in\\nrepresenting the nude human form, but has a wider field; that one can\\nenumerate among the perfect painters those who express historical\\ninventions well and with facility, and who show fine judgment in their\\nfancies; and that he who, in the composition of scenes, can make them\\nneither confused with too much detail nor poor with too little, but\\ndistributed with beautiful invention and order, may also be called an\\nable and judicious craftsman. To this, as Raffaello was well aware,\\nmay be added the enriching those scenes with a bizarre variety of\\nperspectives, buildings, and landscapes, the method of clothing\\nfigures gracefully, the making them fade away sometimes in the\\nshadows, and sometimes come forward into the light, the imparting of\\nlife and beauty to the heads of women, children, young men and old,\\nand the giving them movement and boldness, according to necessity. He\\nconsidered, also, how important is the furious flight of horses in\\nbattles, fierceness in soldiers, the knowledge how to depict all the\\nsorts of animals, and above all the power to give such resemblance to\\nportraits that they seem to be alive, and that it is known whom they\\nrepresent; with an endless number of other things, such as the\\nadornment of draperies, foot-wear, helmets, armour, women's\\nhead-dresses, hair, beards, vases, trees, grottoes, rocks, fires,\\nskies turbid or serene, clouds, rain, lightning, clear weather, night,\\nthe light of the moon, the splendour of the sun, and innumerable other\\nthings, which are called for every moment by the requirements of the\\nart of painting. Pondering over these things, I say, Raffaello\\nresolved, since he could not approach Michelagnolo in that branch of\\nart to which he had set his hand, to seek to equal, and perchance to\\nsurpass him, in these others; and he devoted himself, therefore, not\\nto imitating the manner of that master, but to the attainment of a\\ncatholic excellence in the other fields of art that have been\\ndescribed. And if the same had been done by many craftsmen of our own\\nage, who, having determined to pursue the study of Michelagnolo's\\nworks alone, have failed to imitate him and have not been able to\\nreach his extraordinary perfection, they would not have laboured in\\nvain nor acquired a manner so hard, so full of difficulty, wanting in\\nbeauty and colouring, and poor in invention, but would have been able,\\nby aiming at catholicity and at imitation in the other fields of art,\\nto render service both to themselves and to the world.\\n\\nRaffaello, then, having made this resolution, and having recognized\\nthat Fra Bartolommeo di San Marco had a passing good method of\\npainting, well-grounded draughtsmanship, and a pleasing manner of\\ncolouring, although at times, in order to obtain stronger relief, he\\nmade too much use of darks, took from him what appeared to him to\\nsuit his need and his fancy--namely, a middle course, both in\\ndrawing and in colouring; and mingling with that method certain\\nothers selected from the best work of other masters, out of many\\nmanners he made one, which was looked upon ever afterwards as his\\nown, and which was and always will be vastly esteemed by all\\ncraftsmen. This was then seen perfected in the Sibyls and Prophets\\nof the work that he executed, as has been related, in S. Maria della\\nPace; in the carrying out of which work he was greatly assisted by\\nhaving seen the paintings of Michelagnolo in the Chapel of the Pope.\\nAnd if Raffaello had remained content with this same manner, and had\\nnot sought to give it more grandeur and variety in order to prove\\nthat he had as good a knowledge of the nude as Michelagnolo, he\\nwould not have lost a part of the good name that he had acquired;\\nbut the nudes that he made in that apartment of the Borgia Tower\\nwhere there is the Burning of the Borgo, although they are fine, are\\nnot in every way excellent. In like manner, those that were painted\\nlikewise by him on the ceiling of the Palace of Agostino Chigi in\\nthe Trastevere did not give complete satisfaction, for they are\\nwanting in that grace and sweetness which were peculiar to\\nRaffaello; the reason of which, in great part, was the circumstance\\nthat he had them coloured by others after his design. However,\\nrepenting of this error, like a man of judgment, he resolved\\nafterwards to execute by himself, without assistance from others,\\nthe panel-picture of the Transfiguration of Christ that is in S.\\nPietro a Montorio, wherein are all those qualities which, as has\\nalready been described, are looked for and required in a good\\npicture. And if he had not employed in this work, as it were from\\ncaprice, printer's smoke-black, the nature of which, as has been\\nremarked many times, is to become ever darker with time, to the\\ninjury of the other colours with which it is mixed, I believe that\\nthe picture would still be as fresh as when he painted it; whereas\\nit now appears to be rather a mass of shadows than aught else.\\n\\nI have thought fit, almost at the close of this Life, to make this\\ndiscourse, in order to show with what labour, study, and diligence\\nthis honoured craftsman always pursued his art; and even more for\\nthe sake of other painters, to the end that they may learn how to\\navoid those hindrances from which the wisdom and genius of Raffaello\\nwere able to deliver him. I must add this as well, that every man\\nshould be satisfied and contented with doing that work to which he\\nfeels himself drawn by a natural inclination, and should not seek,\\nout of emulation, to put his hand to that for which nature has not\\nadapted him; for otherwise he will labour in vain, and often to his\\nown shame and loss. Moreover, where striving is enough, no man\\nshould aim at super-striving, merely in order to surpass those\\nwho, by some great gift of nature, or by some special grace bestowed\\non them by God, have performed or are performing miracles in art;\\nfor the reason that he who is not suited to any particular work, can\\nnever reach, let him labour as he may, the goal to which another,\\nwith the assistance of nature, has attained with ease. Of this,\\namong the old craftsmen, we may see an example in Paolo Uccello,\\nwho, striving against the limitations of his powers, in order to\\nadvance, did nothing but go backwards. The same has been done in our\\nown day, no long time since, by Jacopo da Pontormo, and it has been\\nproved by the experience of many others, as we have shown before and\\nwill point out yet again. And this, perchance, happens because\\nHeaven always distributes its favours, to the end that every man may\\nrest content with that which falls to him.\\n\\nBut now, having discoursed on these matters of art, perchance at\\ngreater length than was needful, let us return to the life and death\\nof Raffaello. He had a strait friendship with Cardinal Bernardo\\nDivizio of Bibbiena, who had importuned him for many years to take a\\nwife of his choosing; and Raffaello, while not directly refusing to\\nobey the wishes of the Cardinal, had yet put the matter off, saying\\nthat he would rather wait till three or four years had passed. This\\nterm came upon Raffaello when he was not expecting it, and he was\\nreminded by the Cardinal of his promise; whereupon, seeing himself\\nbound, like the courteous man that he was, he would not break his\\nword, and thus accepted as his wife a niece of that Cardinal. And\\nbecause he was always very ill content with this entanglement, he\\ncontinued to delay the matter in such a way that many months passed\\nwithout the marriage being brought to pass. But it was with no\\ndishonourable motive that he did this, for, having been so many\\nyears in the service of the Court, and being the creditor of Leo\\nfor a good sum, it had been hinted to him that when the hall on\\nwhich he was engaged was finished, the Pope proposed to reward him\\nfor his labours and abilities by giving him a red hat, of which he\\nhad already determined to distribute a good number, and some of them\\nto men of less merit than Raffaello.\\n\\nMeanwhile, pursuing his amours in secret, Raffaello continued to\\ndivert himself beyond measure with the pleasures of love; whence it\\nhappened that, having on one occasion indulged in more than his\\nusual excess, he returned to his house in a violent fever. The\\nphysicians, therefore, believing that he had overheated himself, and\\nreceiving from him no confession of the excess of which he had been\\nguilty, imprudently bled him, insomuch that he was weakened and felt\\nhimself sinking; for he was in need rather of restoratives.\\nThereupon he made his will: and first, like a good Christian, he\\nsent his mistress out of the house, leaving her the means to live\\nhonourably. Next, he divided his possessions among his disciples,\\nGiulio Romano, whom he had always loved dearly, and the Florentine\\nGiovanni Francesco, called Il Fattore, with a priest of Urbino, his\\nkinsman, whose name I do not know. Then he gave orders that some of\\nhis wealth should be used for restoring with new masonry one of the\\nancient tabernacles in S. Maria Ritonda, and for making an altar,\\nwith a marble statue of Our Lady, in that church, which he chose as\\nhis place of repose and burial after death; and he left all the rest\\nto Giulio and Giovanni Francesco, appointing as executor of his will\\nMesser Baldassarre da Pescia, then Datary to the Pope. Finally, he\\nconfessed and was penitent, and ended the course of his life at the\\nage of thirty-seven, on the same day that he was born, which was\\nGood Friday. And even as he embellished the world with his talents,\\nso, it may be believed, does his soul adorn Heaven by its presence.\\n\\nAs he lay dead in the hall where he had been working, there was\\nplaced at his head the picture of the Transfiguration, which he had\\nexecuted for Cardinal de' Medici; and the sight of that living\\npicture, in contrast with the dead body, caused the hearts of all\\nwho beheld it to burst with sorrow. That work, in memory of the loss\\nof Raffaello, was placed by the Cardinal on the high-altar of S.\\nPietro a Montorio; and on account of the nobility of his every\\naction, it was held ever afterwards in great estimation. His body\\nreceived that honourable burial which his noble spirit had deserved,\\nfor there was no craftsman who did not weep with sorrow and follow\\nhim to the grave. His death was also a great grief to the whole\\nCourt of the Pope, first because he had held in his lifetime the\\noffice of Groom of the Chamber, and likewise because he had been so\\ndear to the Pope that his loss caused him to weep bitterly.\\n\\n\\n\\nO happy and blessed spirit, in that every man is glad to speak of\\nthee, to celebrate thy actions, and to admire every drawing that\\nthou didst leave to us! When this noble craftsman died, the art of\\npainting might well have died also, seeing that when he closed his\\neyes, she was left as it were blind. And now for us who have\\nsurvived him, it remains to imitate the good, nay, the supremely\\nexcellent method bequeathed to us by him as a pattern, and, as is\\ncalled for by his merit and our obligations, to hold a most grateful\\nremembrance of this in our minds, and to pay the highest honour to\\nhis memory with our lips. For in truth we have from him art,\\ncolouring, and invention harmonized and brought to such a pitch of\\nperfection as could scarcely be hoped for; nor may any intellect\\never think to surpass him. And in addition to this benefit that he\\nconferred on art, like a true friend to her, as long as he lived he\\nnever ceased to show how one should deal with great men, with those\\nof middle station, and with the lowest. And, indeed, among his\\nextraordinary gifts, I perceive one of such value that I for my part\\nam amazed at it, in that Heaven gave him the power to produce in our\\nart an effect wholly contrary to the nature of us painters, which\\nwas that our craftsmen--I do not mean only the lesser, but also\\nthose whose humour it was to be great persons; and of this humour\\nart creates a vast number--while working in company with Raffaello,\\nfelt themselves naturally united and in such accord, that all evil\\nhumours vanished at the sight of him, and every vile and base\\nthought fell away from their minds. Such unity was never greater at\\nany other time than his; and this happened because they were\\novercome both by his courtesy and by his art, and even more by the\\ngood disposition of his nature, which was so full of gentleness and\\nso overflowing with loving-kindness, that it was seen that the very\\nanimals, not to speak of men, honoured him. It is said that if\\nany painter who knew him, and even any who did not know him, asked\\nhim for some drawing that he needed, Raffaello would leave his own\\nwork in order to assist him. And he always kept a vast number of\\nthem employed, aiding them and teaching them with such a love as\\nmight have been the due rather of his own children than of\\nfellow-craftsmen; for which reason he was never seen to go to Court\\nwithout having with him, as he left his house, some fifty painters,\\nall able and excellent, who kept him company in order to do him\\nhonour. In short, he lived not like a painter, but like a prince.\\nWherefore, O art of painting, thou couldst then esteem thyself\\nindeed most blessed, in possessing a craftsman who, both with his\\ngenius and his virtues, exalted thee higher than Heaven! Truly happy\\nmightest thou call thyself, in that thy disciples, following in the\\nfootsteps of so great a man, have seen how life should be lived, and\\nhow important is the union of art and virtue, which, wedded in\\nRaffaello, had strength to prevail on the magnificent Julius II and\\nthe magnanimous Leo X, exalted as they were in rank and dignity, to\\nmake him their most intimate friend and show him all possible\\ngenerosity, insomuch that by their favour and by the wealth that\\nthey bestowed upon him, he was enabled to do vast honour both to\\nhimself and to art. Blessed, also, may be called all those who,\\nemployed in his service, worked under him, since whoever imitated\\nhim found that he had reached an honourable haven; and in like\\nmanner all those who imitate his labours in art will be honoured by\\nthe world, even as, by resembling him in uprightness of life, they\\nwill win rewards from Heaven.\\n\\nRaffaello received from Bembo the following epitaph:\\n\\n  D.

       " \" OF GUGLIELMO DA MARCILLA\\n\\n[_GUILLAUME DE MARCILLAC, OR THE FRENCH PRIOR_]\\n\\nFRENCH PAINTER AND MASTER OF GLASS WINDOWS\\n\\n\\nAt this same time, wherein our arts were endowed by God with the\\ngreatest felicity that they could possibly enjoy, there flourished\\none Guglielmo da Marcilla, a Frenchman, who, from his constant\\nresidence in Arezzo, and from the affection that he bore to that\\ncity, may be said to have chosen it for his country, insomuch that\\nall men considered and called him an Aretine. And, in truth, among\\nthe benefits that are derived from ability, one is that from\\nwhatever strange and distant region and from however barbarous and\\nunknown a race a man may come, be he who he may, if only he has a\\nmind adorned with ability and practises some ingenious craft with\\nhis hands, no sooner does he make his first appearance in each city\\nto which he turns his steps, demonstrating his worth, than the skill\\nof his hand works so powerfully, that his name, passing from lip to\\nlip, in a short time waxes great, and his qualities become very\\nhighly prized and honoured. And it happens often to a great number\\nof men, who have left their country far behind them, that they\\nchance upon nations that are lovers of ability and of foreigners,\\nwhere, by reason of their upright walk of life, they find themselves\\nrecognized and cherished in such a manner, that they forget the\\ncountry of their birth and choose a new one for their last\\nresting-place.\\n\\nEven so was Arezzo chosen as a final home by Guglielmo, who, as a\\nyouth in France, applied himself to the art of design, and together\\nwith that gave attention to glass windows, in which he made figures\\nno less harmonious in colouring than if they had been painted with\\nthe greatest beauty and harmony in oils. While in his own country,\\npersuaded by the entreaties of certain of his friends, he was\\npresent at the slaying of one who was their enemy: on which account\\nhe was forced to assume the habit of a monk in the Order of S.\\nDominic in France, in order to escape the courts and the hand of\\njustice. But although he remained in that Order, yet he never\\nabandoned the study of art; nay, continuing it, he arrived at the\\nhighest perfection.\\n\\nNow, by order of Pope Julius II, a commission was given to Bramante\\nda Urbino to have a number of glass windows made for the Palace;\\nwhereupon he, making inquiries about the most excellent craftsmen,\\nreceived information of many who were working at that craft, and\\namong them of some who were executing marvellous works in France;\\nand of these he saw a specimen through the French Ambassador who was\\nthen at the Court of his Holiness, and who had in the frame of a\\nwindow in his study a figure executed on a piece of white glass with\\na vast number of colours, fixed on the glass by the action of fire.\\nWherefore, by order of Bramante, a letter was written to France,\\ninviting them to come to Rome, and offering them good payments.\\nThereupon Maestro Claudio, a Frenchman, the head of that art, having\\nreceived the intelligence, and knowing the excellence of Guglielmo,\\nso went to work with money and fair promises, that it was no\\ndifficult matter to draw him out of the convent, particularly\\nbecause Guglielmo, on account of the discourtesy shown to him and\\nthe jealousies that there always are among monks, was even more\\neager to leave it than was Maestro Claudio to get him out. They\\nwent, therefore, to Rome, where the habit of S. Dominic was changed\\nfor that of S. Peter.\\n\\nBramante at that time had caused two windows of travertine to be made in\\nthe Palace of the Pope, which were in the hall in front of the chapel,\\nnow embellished by a vaulted ceiling by Antonio da San Gallo, and by\\nmarvellous stucco-work from the hand of Perino del Vaga of Florence.\\nThese windows were executed by Maestro Claudio and Guglielmo, although\\nafterwards, during the sack of Rome, they were broken to pieces, in\\norder to extract the lead to make harquebus-balls; and they were truly\\nmarvellous. In addition to these, they made an endless number of them\\nfor the apartments of the Pope, which met with the same fate as the\\nother two. And even now there is one to be seen in the room containing\\nRaffaello's Burning of the Borgo, in the Borgia Tower; in which are\\nangels who are holding the escutcheon of Leo X. They also made two\\nwindows for the chapel behind the Madonna in S. Maria del Popolo, with\\nthe stories of her life, which were highly praiseworthy examples of that\\ncraft.\\n\\nThese works brought them no less fame and renown than comfort in\\nlife. But Maestro Claudio, being very intemperate in eating and\\ndrinking, according to the custom of his race, which is a deadly\\nthing in the air of Rome, fell sick of so violent a fever, that in\\nsix days he passed to the other life. Whereupon Guglielmo, left\\nalone, and almost like one lost without his companion, painted by\\nhimself a window, likewise of glass, in S. Maria de Anima, the\\nchurch of the Germans in Rome; which was the reason that Cardinal\\nSilvio of Cortona made him an offer, and made a contract with him\\nthat he should execute some windows and other works in his native\\ncity of Cortona. Wherefore the Cardinal took him in his company to\\ntake up his abode in Cortona; and the first work that he executed\\nwas the façade of the Cardinal's house on the side towards the\\nPiazza, which he painted in chiaroscuro, depicting therein Croton\\nand the other original founders of that city. Thereupon the\\nCardinal, who saw that Guglielmo was no less upright as a man than\\nexcellent as a master of that art, caused him to execute, for the\\nPieve of Cortona, the window of the principal chapel, in which he\\nmade the Nativity of Christ and the Magi adoring Him.\\n\\nGuglielmo was a man of fine spirit and intelligence, and of very\\ngreat mastery in handling glass, and particularly in so distributing\\nthe colours that the brightest should come in the foremost figures,\\nthose in the other figures being darker in proportion as they\\nreceded; in which point he was a rare and truly excellent master.\\nMoreover, he showed very good judgment in the painting of his\\nfigures; whereby he executed them with such unity, that they fell\\nback into the distance little by little, in such a way that they did\\nnot cling either to the buildings or to the landscapes, and had the\\nappearance of being painted on panel, or rather in relief. He showed\\ninvention and variety in the composition of scenes, making them\\nrich and well grouped; and he rendered easy the process of making\\nsuch pictures as are put together out of pieces of glass, which was\\nheld to be very difficult, as indeed it is for one who has not his\\nskill and dexterity. He designed the pictures for his windows with\\nsuch good method and order, that the mountings of lead and iron,\\nwhich cross them in certain places, were so well fitted into the\\njoinings of the figures and the folds of the draperies, that they\\ncannot be seen--nay, they gave the whole such grace, that the brush\\ncould not have done more--and thus he was able to make a virtue of\\nnecessity.\\n\\nGuglielmo used only two kinds of colour for the shading of such\\nglass as he proposed to subject to the action of fire; one was scale\\nof iron, and the other scale of copper. That of iron, which is dark,\\nserved to shade draperies, hair, and buildings; and the other, that\\nof copper, which produces a tawny tint, served for flesh colours. He\\nalso made much use of a hard stone that comes from Flanders and\\nFrance, called at the present day hematite, which is red in colour\\nand is much employed for burnishing gold. This, having first been\\npounded in a bronze mortar, and then ground with an iron brazing\\ninstrument on a plate of copper or yellow brass, and tempered with\\ngum, works divinely well on glass.\\n\\nWhen Guglielmo first arrived in Rome, he was no great draughtsman,\\nalthough he was well practised in every other respect. But having\\nrecognized the need of this, he applied himself to the study of\\ndrawing, in spite of his being well advanced in years; and thus\\nlittle by little he achieved the improvement that is evident in the\\nwindows that he afterwards made for the Palace of the said Cardinal\\nat Cortona, and for the other without the city, in a round window\\nthat is in the aforesaid Pieve, over the façade, on the right hand\\nas one enters the church, wherein are the arms of Pope Leo X, and\\nlikewise in two little windows that are in the Company of Gesù, in\\none of which is a Christ, and in the other a S. Onofrio. These are\\nno little different from his early works, and much better.\\n\\nNow while Guglielmo, as has been related, was living in Cortona,\\nthere died at Arezzo one Fabiano di Stagio Sassoli, an Aretine, who\\nhad been a very good master of the making of large windows.\\nThereupon the Wardens of Works for the Vescovado gave the commission\\nfor three windows in the principal chapel, each twenty braccia in\\nheight, to Stagio, the son of the said Fabiano, and to the painter\\nDomenico Pecori; but when these were finished and fixed in their\\nplaces, they gave no great satisfaction to the Aretines, although\\nthey were passing good and rather worthy of praise than otherwise.\\nIt happened at this time that Messer Lodovico Belichini, an\\nexcellent physician, and one of the first men in the government of\\nthe city of Arezzo, went to Cortona to cure the mother of the\\naforesaid Cardinal; and there he became well acquainted with our\\nGuglielmo, with whom, when he had time, he was very willing to\\nconverse. And Guglielmo, who was then called the Prior, from his\\nhaving received about that time the benefice of a priory, likewise\\nconceived an affection for that physician, who asked him one day\\nwhether, with the good will of the Cardinal, he would go to Arezzo\\nto execute some windows; at which Guglielmo promised that he would,\\nand with the permission and good will of the Cardinal he made his\\nway to that city. Now Stagio, of whom we have spoken above, having\\nparted from the company of Domenico, received Guglielmo into his\\nhouse; and the latter, for his first work, executed for a window of\\nthe Chapel of S. Lucia, belonging to the Albergotti, in the\\nVescovado of Arezzo, that Saint and a S. Sylvester, in so good a\\nmanner that the work may truly be said to be made with living\\nfigures, and not of coloured and transparent glass, or at least to\\nbe a picture worthy of praise and marvellous. For besides the\\nmastery shown in the flesh-colours, the glasses are flashed; that\\nis, in some places the first skin has been removed, and the glass\\nthen coloured with another tint; by which is meant, for example, the\\nplacing of yellow over red flashed glass, or the application of\\nwhite and green over blue; which is a difficult and even miraculous\\nthing in this craft. The first or true colour, then, such as red,\\nblue, or green, covers the whole of one side; and the other part,\\nwhich is as thick as the blade of a knife, or a little more, is\\nwhite. Many, being afraid that they might break the glasses, on\\naccount of their lack of skill in handling them, do not employ a\\npointed iron for removing that layer, but in place of this, for\\ngreater safety, set about grinding the glasses with a copper wheel\\nfixed on the end of an iron instrument; and thus, little by little,\\nby the use of emery, they contrive to leave only a layer of white\\nglass, which turns out very clear. Then, if a yellow colour has to\\nbe applied to the piece of glass thus left white, at the moment when\\nit is to be placed into the furnace for firing, it is painted by\\nmeans of a brush with calcined silver, which is a colour similar to\\nbole, but somewhat thick; and in the fire this melts over the glass,\\nfuses, and takes a firm hold, penetrating into the glass and making\\na very beautiful yellow. These methods of working no one used\\nbetter, or with more ingenuity and art, than Prior Guglielmo; and it\\nis in these things that the difficulty consists, for painting the\\nglass with oil-colours or in any other manner is little or nothing,\\nand that it should be diaphanous or transparent is not a matter of\\nmuch importance, whereas firing it in the furnace and making it such\\nthat it will withstand the action of water and remain fresh for\\never, is a difficult work and well worthy of praise. Wherefore this\\nexcellent master deserves the highest praise, since there is not a\\nman of his profession who has done as much, whether in design, or\\ninvention, or colouring, or general excellence.\\n\\nHe then made the great round-window of the same church, containing\\nthe Descent of the Holy Spirit, and likewise the Baptism of Christ\\nby S. John, wherein he represented Christ in the Jordan, awaiting S.\\nJohn, who has taken a cup of water in order to baptize Him, while a\\nnude old man is taking off his shoes, and some angels are preparing\\nChrist's raiment, and on high is the Father, sending down the Holy\\nSpirit upon His Son. This window is over the baptismal font of that\\nDuomo, for which he also executed the window containing the\\nResurrection of Lazarus on the fourth day after death; wherein it\\nseems impossible that he could have included in so small a space\\nsuch a number of figures, in which may be recognized the terror and\\namazement of the people, with the stench from the body of Lazarus,\\nwhose resurrection causes his two sisters to rejoice amid their\\ntears. In this work are innumerable colours, flashed one over the\\nother in the glass, and every least thing truly appears most natural\\nin its own kind.\\n\\nAnd whoever wishes to learn how much the hand of the Prior was able\\nto effect in this art, should study the window of S. Matthew over\\nthe Chapel of that Apostle, and observe the marvellous invention of\\nthat scene, wherein he can see a living figure of Christ calling\\nMatthew from his tables, while Matthew, following Him and stretching\\nout his arms to receive Him, abandons the riches and treasures that\\nhe has acquired. And at the same time an Apostle may be seen in a\\nvery spirited attitude, awaking another who has fallen asleep on\\nsome steps; and in like manner there may also be perceived a S.\\nPeter speaking with S. John, both being so beautiful that they seem\\ntruly divine. In this same window are temples in perspective,\\nstaircases, and figures so well grouped, and landscapes so natural,\\nthat one would never think it was glass, but rather a thing rained\\ndown from Heaven for the consolation of mankind. In the same place\\nhe made the window of S. Anthony and that of S. Nicholas, both most\\nbeautiful, with two others, one containing the scene of Christ\\ndriving the traders from the Temple, and the other that of the woman\\ntaken in adultery; all these works being held to be truly excellent\\nand marvellous.\\n\\nSo fully were the labours and abilities of the Prior recognized by\\nthe Aretines, what with praises, favours, and rewards, and so\\nsatisfied and contented was he by this result, that he resolved to\\nadopt that city as his home, and to change himself from a Frenchman\\ninto an Aretine. Afterwards, reflecting in his own mind that the art\\nof glass-painting, on account of the destruction that takes place\\nevery moment in such works, was no lasting one, there came to him a\\ndesire to devote himself to painting, and he therefore undertook to\\nexecute for the Wardens of Works of the Vescovado in that city three\\nvery large vaults in fresco, thinking thus to leave a memorial of\\nhimself behind him. The Aretines, in return for this, presented to\\nhim a farm that belonged to the Confraternity of S. Maria della\\nMisericordia, near their city, with some excellent houses, for his\\nenjoyment during his lifetime. And they ordained that when the work\\nwas finished, its value should be estimated by some distinguished\\ncraftsman, and that the Wardens should make this good to him in\\nfull. Whereupon he made up his mind to show his worth in this\\nundertaking, and he made his figures very large on account of the\\nheight, after the manner of the works in Michelagnolo's chapel. And\\nso mightily did his wish to become excellent in such an art avail in\\nhim, that although he was fifty years of age, he improved little by\\nlittle in such a manner, that he showed that his knowledge and\\ncomprehension of the beautiful were not less than his delight in\\nimitating the good in the execution of his work. He went on to\\nrepresent the earlier events of the New Testament, even as in the\\nthree large works he had depicted the beginning of the Old. For this\\nreason, therefore, I am inclined to believe that any man of genius\\nwho has the desire to attain to perfection, is able, if he will but\\ntake the pains, to make naught of the limits of any science. At the\\nbeginning of those works, indeed, he was alarmed by their size, and\\nbecause he had never executed any before; which was the reason that\\nhe sent to Rome for Maestro Giovanni, a French miniaturist, who,\\ncoming to Arezzo, painted over S. Antonio an arch with a Christ in\\nfresco, and for that Company the banner that is carried in\\nprocessions, which he executed with great diligence, having received\\nthe commission for them from the Prior.\\n\\nAt the same time Guglielmo made the round window for the façade of\\nthe Church of S. Francesco, a great work, in which he represented\\nthe Pope in Consistory, with the Conclave of Cardinals, and S.\\nFrancis going to Rome for the confirmation of his Rule and bearing\\nthe roses of January. In this work he proved what a master of\\ncomposition he was, so that it may be said with truth that he was\\nborn for that profession; nor may any craftsman ever think to equal\\nhim in beauty, in abundance of figures, or in grace. There are\\ninnumerable windows executed by him throughout that city, all most\\nbeautiful, such as the great round window in the Madonna delle\\nLacrime, containing the Assumption of Our Lady and the Apostles, and\\na very beautiful window with an Annunciation; a round window with\\nthe Marriage of the Virgin, and another containing a S. Jerome\\nexecuted for the Spadari, and likewise three other windows below, in\\nvarious parts of the church; with a most beautiful round window with\\nthe Nativity of Christ in the Church of S. Girolamo, and another in\\nS. Rocco. He sent some, also, to various places, such as Castiglione\\ndel Lago, and one to Florence for Lodovico Capponi, to be set up in\\nS. Felicita, where there is the panel by Jacopo da Pontormo, a most\\nexcellent painter, and the chapel adorned by him with mural\\npaintings in oils and in fresco and with panel-pictures; which\\nwindow came into the hands of the Frati Ingesuati in Florence, who\\nworked at that craft, and they took it all to pieces in order to\\nlearn how it was made, removing many pieces as specimens and\\nreplacing them with new ones, so that in the end they made quite a\\ndifferent window.\\n\\nHe also conceived the wish to paint in oils, and for the Chapel of\\nthe Conception in S. Francesco at Arezzo he executed a panel-picture\\nwherein are some vestments very well painted, and many heads most\\nlifelike, and so beautiful that he was honoured thereby ever\\nafterwards, seeing that this was the first work that he had ever\\ndone in oils.\\n\\nThe Prior was a very honourable person, and delighted in agriculture\\nand in making alterations in buildings; wherefore, having bought a\\nmost beautiful house, he made in it a vast number of improvements.\\nAs a man of religion, he was always most upright in his ways; and\\nthe remorse of conscience, on account of his departure from his\\nconvent, kept him sorely afflicted. For which reason he made a very\\nbeautiful window for the Chapel of the High-altar in S. Domenico, a\\nconvent of his Order at Arezzo; wherein he depicted a vine that\\nissues from the body of S. Dominic and embraces a great number of\\nsanctified friars, who constitute the tree of the Order; and at the\\nhighest point is Our Lady, with Christ, who is marrying S. Catherine\\nof Siena--a work much extolled and of great mastery, for which he\\nwould accept no payment, believing himself to be much indebted to\\nthat Order. He sent a very beautiful window to S. Lorenzo in\\nPerugia, and an endless number of others to many places round\\nArezzo.\\n\\nAnd because he took much pleasure in matters of architecture, he\\nmade for the citizens of that country a number of designs of\\nbuildings and adornments for their city, such as the two doors of S.\\nRocco in stone, and the ornament of grey-stone that was added to the\\npanel-picture of Maestro Luca in S. Girolamo; and he designed an\\nornament in the Abbey of Cipriano d' Anghiari, and another for the\\nCompany of the Trinità in the Chapel of the Crocifisso, and a very\\nrich lavatory for the sacristy; which were all executed with great\\nperfection by the stone-cutter Santi.\\n\\nFinally, ever delighting in labour, and continually working both\\nwinter and summer at his mural painting, which breaks down the\\nhealthiest of men, he became so afflicted by the damp and so\\nswollen with dropsy, that his physicians had to tap him, and in a\\nfew days he rendered up his soul to Him who had given it. First,\\nlike a good Christian, he partook of the Sacraments of the Church,\\nand made his will. Then, having a particular devotion for the\\nHermits of Camaldoli, who have their seat on the summit of the\\nApennines, twenty miles distant from Arezzo, he bequeathed to them\\nhis property and his body, and to Pastorino da Siena, his assistant,\\nwho had been with him many years, he left his glasses, his\\nworking-instruments, and his designs, of which there is one in our\\nbook, a scene of the Submersion of Pharaoh in the Red Sea.\\n\\nThis Pastorino afterwards applied himself to many other fields of\\nart, and also to glass windows, although the works that he produced\\nin that craft were but few. Guglielmo was much imitated, also, by\\none Maso Porro of Cortona, who was more able in firing and putting\\ntogether the glass than in painting it. One of the pupils of\\nGuglielmo was Battista Borro of Arezzo, who continues to imitate him\\ngreatly in the making of windows; and he also taught the first\\nrudiments to Benedetto Spadari and to Giorgio Vasari of Arezzo.\\n\\nThe Prior lived sixty-two years, and died in the year 1537. He\\ndeserves infinite praise, in that by him there was brought into\\nTuscany the art of working in glass with the greatest mastery and\\ndelicacy that could be desired. Wherefore, since he conferred such\\ngreat benefits upon us, we also will pay him honour, exalting him\\ncontinually with loving and unceasing praise both for his life and\\nfor his works.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSIMONE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " ' OF SIMONE, CALLED IL CRONACA\\n\\n[_SIMONE DEL POLLAIUOLO_]\\n\\nARCHITECT OF FLORENCE\\n\\n\\nMany intellects are lost that would make rare and worthy works, if,\\non coming into the world, they were to hit upon persons able and\\nwilling to set them to work on those labours for which they are\\nfitted. But it often happens that he who has the means is neither\\ncapable nor willing; and if, indeed, there chances to be one willing\\nto erect some worthy building, he often takes no manner of care to\\nseek out an architect of real merit or of any loftiness of spirit.\\nNay, he puts his honour and glory into the keeping of certain\\nthievish creatures, who generally disgrace the name and fame of such\\nmemorials; and in order to thrust forward into greatness those who\\ndepend entirely upon him (so great is the power of ambition), he\\noften rejects the good designs that are offered to him, and puts\\ninto execution the very worst; wherefore his own fame is left\\nbesmirched by the clumsiness of the work, since it is considered by\\nall men of judgment that the craftsman and the patron who employs\\nhim, in that they are conjoined in their works, are of one and the\\nsame mind. And on the other hand, how many Princes of little\\nunderstanding have there been, who, through having chanced upon\\npersons of excellence and judgment, have obtained after death no\\nless fame from the memory of their buildings than they enjoyed when\\nalive from their sovereignty over their people.\\n\\nTruly fortunate, however, in his day, was Cronaca, in that he not\\nonly had the knowledge, but also found those who kept him\\ncontinually employed, and that always on great and magnificent\\nworks. Of him it is related that while Antonio Pollaiuolo was in\\nRome, working at the tombs of bronze that are in S. Pietro, there\\ncame to his house a young lad, his relative, whose proper name was\\nSimone, and who had fled from Florence on account of some brawl.\\nThis Simone, having worked with a master in woodwork, and being much\\ninclined to the art of architecture, began to observe the beautiful\\nantiquities of that city, and, delighting in them, went about\\nmeasuring them with the greatest diligence. And, going on with this,\\nhe had not been long in Rome before he showed that he had made much\\nproficience, both in taking measurements and in carrying one or two\\nthings into execution.\\n\\nThereupon he conceived the idea of returning to Florence, and\\ndeparted from Rome; and on arriving in his native city, having\\nbecome a passing good master of words, he described the marvels of\\nRome and of other places with such accuracy, that from that time\\nonwards he was called Il Cronaca, every man thinking that he was\\ntruly a chronicle of information in his discourse. Now he had become\\nsuch that he was held to be the most excellent of the modern\\narchitects in the city of Florence, seeing that he had good judgment\\nin choosing sites, and showed that he had an intellect more lofty\\nthan that of many others who were engaged in that profession; for it\\nwas evident from his works how good an imitator he was of\\nantiquities, and how closely he had observed the rules of Vitruvius\\nand the works of Filippo di Ser Brunellesco.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere was then in Florence that Filippo Strozzi who is now called\\n\"the elder,\" to distinguish him from his son; and he, being very\\nrich, wished to leave to his native city and to his children, among\\nother memorials of himself, one in the form of a beautiful palace.\\nWherefore Benedetto da Maiano, having been called upon by him for\\nthis purpose, made him a model entirely isolated, which was\\nafterwards put into execution, although not in all its extent, as\\nwill be related below, for some of his neighbours would not give up\\ntheir houses to accommodate him. Benedetto began the palace,\\ntherefore, in the best way that he could, and brought the outer\\nshell almost to completion before the death of Filippo: which outer\\nshell is in the Rustic Order, with varying degrees of rustication,\\nas may be seen, since the boss-covered part from the first range of\\nwindows downwards, together with the doors, is very much Rustic, and\\nthe part from the first range of windows to the second is much less\\nRustic. Now it happened that at the very moment when Benedetto\\nwas leaving Florence, Cronaca returned from Rome; whereupon, Simone\\nbeing presented to Filippo, the latter was so pleased with the model\\nthat he made for the courtyard and for the great cornice which goes\\nround the outer side of the palace, that, having recognized the\\nexcellence of his intellect, he decided that thenceforward the whole\\nwork should pass through his hands, and availed himself of his\\nservices ever afterwards. Cronaca, then, in addition to the\\nbeautiful exterior in the Tuscan Order, made at the top a very\\nmagnificent Corinthian cornice, which serves to complete the roof;\\nand half of it is seen finished at the present day, with such\\nextraordinary grace that nothing could be added to it, nor could\\nanything more beautiful be desired. This cornice was taken by\\nCronaca, who copied it in Rome with exact measurements, from an\\nancient one that is to be found at Spoglia Cristo, which is held to\\nbe the most beautiful among the many that are in that city; although\\nit is true that it was enlarged by Cronaca to the proportions\\nrequired by the palace, to the end that it might make a suitable\\nfinish, and might also complete the roof of that palace by means of\\nits projection. Thus, then, the genius of Cronaca was able to make\\nuse of the works of others and to transform them almost into his\\nown; which does not succeed with many, since the difficulty lies not\\nin merely having drawings and copies of beautiful things, but in\\naccommodating them to the purpose which they have to serve, with\\ngrace, true measurement, proportion, and fitness. But just as much\\nas this cornice of Cronaca\\'s was and always will be extolled, so was\\nthat one censured which was made for the Palace of the Bartolini in\\nthe same city by Baccio d\\' Agnolo, who, seeking to imitate Cronaca,\\nplaced over a small façade, delicate in detail, a great ancient\\ncornice copied with the exact measurements from the frontispiece of\\nMonte Cavallo; which resulted in such ugliness, from his not having\\nknown how to adapt it with judgment, that it could not look worse,\\nfor it seems like an enormous cap on a small head. It is not enough\\nfor craftsmen, when they have executed their works, to excuse\\nthemselves, as many do, by saying that they were taken with exact\\nmeasurements from the antique and copied from good masters, seeing\\nthat good judgment and the eye play a greater part in all such\\nmatters than measuring with compasses. Cronaca, then, executed half\\nof the said cornice with great art right round that palace, together\\nwith dentils and ovoli, and finished it completely on two sides,\\ncounterpoising the stones in such a way, in order that they might\\nturn out well bound and balanced, that there is no better masonry to\\nbe seen, nor any carried to perfection with more diligence. In like\\nmanner, all the other stones are so well put together, and with so\\nhigh a finish, that the whole does not appear to be of masonry, but\\nrather all of one piece. And to the end that everything might be in\\nkeeping, he caused beautiful pieces of iron-work to be made for all\\nparts of the palace, as adornments for it, and the lanterns that are\\nat the corners, which were all executed with supreme diligence by\\nNiccolò Grosso, called Il Caparra, a smith of Florence. In those\\nmarvellous lanterns may be seen cornices, columns, capitals, and\\nbrackets of iron, fixed together with wonderful craftsmanship; nor\\nhas any modern ever executed in iron works so large and so\\ndifficult, and with such knowledge and mastery.\\n\\n\\n\\nNiccolò Grosso was an eccentric and self-willed person, claiming\\njustice for himself and giving it to others, and never covetous of\\nwhat was not his own. He would never give anyone credit in the\\npayment of his works, and always insisted on having his\\nearnest-money. For this reason Lorenzo de\\' Medici called him Il\\nCaparra, and he was known to many others by that name. He had a\\nsign fixed over his shop, wherein were books burning; wherefore,\\nwhen one asked for time to make his payment, he would say, \"I cannot\\ngive it, for my books are burning, and I can enter no more debtors\\nin them.\" He was commissioned by the honourable Captains of the\\nGuelph party to make a pair of andirons, which, when he had finished\\nthem, were sent for several times. But he kept saying, \"On this\\nanvil do I sweat and labour, and on it will I have my money paid\\ndown.\" Whereupon they sent to him once more for the work, with a\\nmessage that he should come for his money, for he would straightway\\nbe paid; but he, still obstinate, answered that they must first\\nbring the money. The provveditore, therefore, knowing that the\\nCaptains wished to see the work, fell into a rage, and sent to him\\nsaying that he had received half the money, and that when he\\nhad dispatched the andirons, he would pay him the rest. On which\\naccount Caparra, recognizing that this was true, gave one of the\\nandirons to the messenger, saying: \"Take them this one, for it is\\ntheirs; and if it pleases them, bring me the rest of the money, and\\nI will hand over the other; but at present it is mine.\" The\\nofficials, seeing the marvellous work that he had put into it, sent\\nthe money to his shop; and he sent them the other andiron. It is\\nrelated, also, that Lorenzo de\\' Medici resolved to have some pieces\\nof iron-work made, to be sent abroad as presents, in order that the\\nexcellence of Caparra might be made known. He went, therefore, to\\nhis shop, and happened to find him working at some things for\\ncertain poor people, from whom he had received part of the price as\\nearnest-money. On Lorenzo making his request, Niccolò would in no\\nway promise to serve him before having satisfied the others, saying\\nthat they had come to his shop before Lorenzo, and that he valued\\ntheir money as much as his. To the same master some young men of the\\ncity brought a design, from which he was to make for them an iron\\ninstrument for breaking and forcing open other irons by means of a\\nscrew, but he absolutely refused to serve them; nay, he upbraided\\nthem, and said: \"Nothing will induce me to serve you in such a\\nmatter; for these things are nothing but thieves\\' tools, or\\ninstruments for abducting and dishonouring young girls. Such things\\nare not for me, I tell you, nor for you, who seem to me to be honest\\nmen.\" And they, perceiving that Caparra would not do their will,\\nasked him who there was in Florence who might serve them; whereupon,\\nflying into a rage, he drove them away with a torrent of abuse. He\\nwould never work for Jews, and was wont, indeed, to say that their\\nmoney was putrid and stinking. He was a good man and a religious,\\nbut whimsical in brain and obstinate: and he would never leave\\nFlorence, for all the offers that were made to him, but lived and\\ndied in that city. Of him I have thought it right to make this\\nrecord, because he was truly unique in his craft, and has never had\\nand never will have an equal, as may be seen best from the iron-work\\nand the beautiful lanterns of the Palace of the Strozzi.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis palace was brought to completion by Cronaca, and adorned with\\na very rich courtyard in the Corinthian and Doric Orders, with\\nornaments in the form of columns, capitals, cornices, windows, and\\ndoors, all most beautiful. And if it should appear to anyone that\\nthe interior of this palace is not in keeping with the exterior, he\\nmust know that the fault is not Cronaca\\'s, for the reason that he\\nwas forced to adapt his interior to an outer shell begun by others,\\nand to follow in great measure what had been laid down by those\\nbefore him; and it was no small feat for him to have given it such\\nbeauty as it displays. The same answer may be made to any who say\\nthat the ascent of the stairs is not easy, nor correct in\\nproportion, but too steep and sudden; and likewise, also, to such as\\nsay that the rooms and apartments of the interior in general are out\\nof keeping, as has been described, with the grandeur and\\nmagnificence of the exterior. Nevertheless this palace will never be\\nheld as other than truly magnificent, and equal to any private\\nbuilding whatsoever that has been erected in Italy in our own times;\\nwherefore Cronaca rightly obtained, as he still does, infinite\\ncommendation for this work.\\n\\nThe same master built the Sacristy of S. Spirito in Florence, which\\nis in the form of an octagonal temple, beautiful in proportions, and\\nexecuted with a high finish; and among other things to be seen in\\nthis work are some capitals fashioned by the happy hand of Andrea\\ndal Monte Sansovino, which are wrought with supreme perfection; and\\nsuch, likewise, is the antechamber of that sacristy, which is held\\nto be very beautiful in invention, although the coffered ceiling, as\\nwill be described, is not well distributed over the columns. The\\nsame Cronaca also erected the Church of S. Francesco dell\\'\\nOsservanza on the hill of S. Miniato, without Florence; and likewise\\nthe whole of the Convent of the Servite Friars, which is a highly\\nextolled work.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt this same time there was about to be built, by the advice of Fra\\nGirolamo Savonarola, a most famous preacher of that day, the Great\\nCouncil Chamber of the Palace of the Signoria in Florence; and for\\nthis opinions were taken from Leonardo da Vinci, Michelagnolo\\nBuonarroti, although he was a mere lad, Giuliano da San Gallo,\\nBaccio d\\' Agnolo, and Simone del Pollaiuolo, called Il Cronaca, who\\nwas the devoted friend and follower of Savonarola. These men, after\\nmany disputes, came to an agreement, and decided that the Hall\\nshould be made in that form which it retained down to our own times,\\nwhen, as has been mentioned and will be related yet again in another\\nplace, it was almost rebuilt. The charge of the whole work was given\\nto Cronaca, as a man of talent and also as the friend of the\\naforesaid Fra Girolamo; and he executed it with great promptitude\\nand diligence, showing the beauty of his genius particularly in the\\nmaking of the roof, since the structure is of vast extent in every\\ndirection. He made the tie-beams of the roof-truss, which are\\nthirty-eight braccia in length from wall to wall, of a number of\\ntimbers well scarfed and fastened together, since it was not\\npossible to find beams of sufficient size for the purpose; and\\nwhereas the tie-beams of other roof-trusses have only one king-post,\\nall those of this Hall have three each, a king-post in the middle,\\nand a queen-post on either side. The rafters are long in proportion,\\nand so are the struts of each king-post and queen-post; nor must I\\nomit to say that the struts of the queen-posts, on the side nearest\\nthe wall, thrust against the rafters, and, towards the centre,\\nagainst the struts of the king-post. I have thought it right to\\ndescribe how this roof-truss is made, because it was constructed\\nwith beautiful design, and I have seen drawings made of it by many\\nfor sending to various places. When these tie-beams, thus contrived,\\nhad been drawn up and placed at intervals of six braccia, and the\\nroof had been likewise laid down in a very short space of time,\\nCronaca attended to the fixing of the ceiling, which was then made\\nof plain wood and divided into panels, each of which was four\\nbraccia square and surrounded by an ornamental cornice of few\\nmembers; and a flat moulding was made of the same width as the\\nplanks, which enclosed the panels and the whole work, with large\\nbosses at the intersections and the corners of the whole ceiling.\\nAnd although the end walls of this Hall, one on either side, were\\neight braccia out of the square, they did not make up their minds,\\nas they might have done, to thicken the walls so as to make it\\nsquare, but carried them up to the roof just as they were, making\\nthree large windows on each of those end walls. But when the whole\\nwas finished, the Hall, on account of its extraordinary size, turned\\nout to be too dark, and also stunted and wanting in height in\\nrelation to its great length and breadth; in short, almost wholly\\nout of proportion. They sought, therefore, but with little success,\\nto improve it by making two windows in the middle of the eastern\\nside of the Hall, and four on the western side. After this, in order\\nto give it its final completion, they made on the level of the brick\\nfloor, with great rapidity, being much pressed by the citizens, a\\nwooden tribune right round the walls of the Hall, three braccia both\\nin breadth and height, with seats after the manner of a theatre, and\\nwith a balustrade in front; on which tribune all the magistrates of\\nthe city were to sit. In the middle of the eastern side was a more\\nelevated daïs, on which the Signori sat with the Gonfalonier of\\nJustice; and on either side of this more prominent place was a door,\\none of them leading to the Segreto and the other to the\\nSpecchio. Opposite to this, on the west side, was an altar at\\nwhich Mass was read, with a panel by the hand of Fra Bartolommeo, as\\nhas been mentioned; and beside the altar was the pulpit for making\\nspeeches. In the middle of the Hall, then, were benches in rows laid\\ncrossways, for the citizens; while in the centre and at the corners\\nof the tribune were some gangways with six steps, providing a\\nconvenient ascent for the ushers in the collection of votes. In this\\nHall, which was much extolled at that day for its many beautiful\\nfeatures and the rapidity with which it was erected, time has since\\nserved to reveal such errors as that it is low, dark, gloomy, and\\nout of the square. Nevertheless Cronaca and the others deserve to be\\nexcused, both on account of the haste with which it was executed at\\nthe desire of the citizens, who intended in time to have it adorned\\nwith pictures and the ceiling overlaid with gold, and because up to\\nthat day there had been no greater hall built in Italy; although\\nthere are others very large, such as that of the Palace of S. Marco\\nin Rome, that of the Vatican, erected by Pius II and Innocent VIII,\\nthat of the Castle of Naples, that of the Palace of Milan, and those\\nof Urbino, Venice, and Padua.\\n\\nAfter this, to provide an ascent to this Hall, Cronaca, with the\\nadvice of the same masters, made a great staircase six braccia wide\\nand curving in two flights, richly adorned with grey-stone, and with\\nCorinthian pilasters and capitals, double cornices, and arches, of\\nthe same stone; and with barrel-shaped vaulting, and windows with\\ncolumns of variegated marble and carved marble capitals. But\\nalthough this work was much extolled, it would have won even greater\\npraise if the staircase had not turned out inconvenient and too\\nsteep; for it is a sure fact that it could have been made more\\ngentle, as has been done in the time of Duke Cosimo, within the same\\namount of space and no more, in the new staircase made, opposite to\\nthat of Cronaca, by Giorgio Vasari, which is so gentle in ascent and\\nso convenient, that going up it is almost like walking on the level.\\nThis has been the work of the aforesaid Lord Duke Cosimo, who, being\\na man of most happy genius and most profound judgment both in the\\ngovernment of his people and in all other things, grudges neither\\nexpense nor anything else in his desire to make all the\\nfortifications and other buildings, both public and private,\\ncorrespond to the greatness of his own mind, and not less beautiful\\nthan useful or less useful than beautiful.\\n\\nHis Excellency, then, reflecting that the body of this Hall is the\\nlargest, the most magnificent, and the most beautiful in all Europe,\\nhas resolved to have it improved in such parts as are defective, and\\nto have it made in every other part more ornate than any other\\nstructure in Italy, by the design and hand of Giorgio Vasari of\\nArezzo. And thus, the walls having been raised twelve braccia above\\ntheir former height, in such a manner that the height from the\\npavement to the ceiling is thirty-two braccia, the roof-truss made\\nby Cronaca to support the roof has been restored and replaced on\\nhigh after a new arrangement; and the old ceiling, which was simple\\nand commonplace, and by no means worthy of that Hall, has been\\nremodelled with a system of compartments of great variety, rich in\\nmouldings, full of carvings, and all overlaid with gold, together\\nwith thirty-nine painted panels, square, round, and octagonal, the\\ngreater number of which are each nine braccia in extent, and some\\neven more, and all containing scenes painted in oils, with the\\nlargest figures seven or eight braccia high. In these stories,\\ncommencing with the very beginning, may be seen the rise, the\\nhonours, the victories, and the glorious deeds of the city and\\nstate of Florence, and in particular the wars of Pisa and Siena,\\ntogether with an endless number of other things, which it would take\\ntoo long to describe. And on each of the side walls there has been\\nleft a convenient space of sixty braccia, in each of which are to be\\npainted three scenes in keeping with the ceiling and embracing the\\nspace of seven pictures on either side, which represent events from\\nthe wars of Pisa and Siena. These compartments on the walls are so\\nlarge, that no greater spaces for the painting of historical\\npictures have ever been seen either by the ancients or by the\\nmoderns. And the said compartments are adorned by some vast stone\\nornaments which meet at the ends of the Hall, at one side of which,\\nnamely, the northern side, the Lord Duke has caused to be finished a\\nwork begun and carried nearly to completion by Baccio Bandinelli,\\nthat is, a façade filled with columns and pilasters and with niches\\ncontaining statues of marble; which space is to serve as a public\\naudience chamber, as will be related in the proper place. On the\\nother side, opposite to this, there is to be, in a similar façade\\nthat is being made by the sculptor and architect Ammanati, a\\nfountain to throw up water in the Hall, with a rich and most\\nbeautiful adornment of columns and statues of marble and bronze. Nor\\nwill I forbear to say that this Hall, in consequence of the roof\\nhaving been raised twelve braccia, has gained not only height, but\\nalso an ample supply of windows, since, in addition to the others\\nthat are higher up, in each of those end walls are to be made three\\nlarge windows, which will be over the level of a corridor that is to\\nform a loggia within the Hall and to extend on one side over the\\nwork of Bandinelli, whence there will be revealed a most beautiful\\nview of the whole Piazza. But of this Hall, and of the other\\nimprovements that have been or are being made in the Palace, there\\nwill be a longer account in another place. This only let me say at\\npresent, that if Cronaca and those other ingenious craftsmen who\\ngave the design for the Hall could return to life, in my belief they\\nwould not recognize either the Palace, or the Hall, or any other\\nthing that is there. The Hall, namely, that part which is\\nrectangular, without counting the works of Bandinelli and Ammanati,\\nis ninety braccia in length and thirty-eight braccia in breadth.\\n\\nBut returning to Cronaca: in the last years of his life there\\nentered into his head such a frenzy for the cause of Fra Girolamo\\nSavonarola, that he would talk of nothing else but that. Living\\nthus, in the end he died after a passing long illness, at the age of\\nfifty-five, and was buried honourably in the Church of S. Ambrogio\\nat Florence, in the year 1509; and after no long space of time the\\nfollowing epitaph was written for him by Messer Giovan Battista\\nStrozzi:\\n\\n  CRONACA\\n  VIVO, E MILLE E MILLE ANNI E MILLE ANCORA,\\n  MERCÈ DE\\' VIVI MIEI PALAZZI E TEMPI,\\n  BELLA ROMA, VIVRÀ L\\' ALMA MIA FLORA.\\n\\nCronaca had a brother called Matteo, who gave himself to sculpture\\nand worked under the sculptor Antonio Rossellino; but although he\\nwas a man of good and beautiful intelligence, a fine draughtsman,\\nand well practised in working marble, he left no finished work,\\nbecause, being snatched from the world by death at the age of\\nnineteen, he was not able to accomplish that which was expected from\\nhim by all who knew him.\\n\\n\\nDOMENICO PULIGO\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " \" OF DOMENICO PULIGO\\n\\nPAINTER OF FLORENCE\\n\\n\\nIt is a marvellous and almost incredible thing, that many followers\\nof the art of painting, through continual practice and handling of\\ncolours, either by an instinct of nature or by the trick of a good\\nmanner, acquired without any draughtsmanship or grounding, carry\\ntheir works to such thorough completion, and very often contrive to\\nmake them so good, that, although the craftsmen themselves may be\\nnone of the rarest, their pictures force the world to extol them and\\nto hold them in supreme veneration. And it has been perceived in the\\npast from many examples, and in many of our painters, that the most\\nvivacious and perfect works are produced by those who have a\\nbeautiful manner from nature, although they must exercise it with\\ncontinual study and labour; while this gift of nature has such\\npower, that even if they neglect or abandon the studies of art, and\\npay attention to nothing save the mere practice of painting and of\\nhandling colours with a grace infused in them by nature, at the\\nfirst glance their works have the appearance of displaying all the\\nexcellent and marvellous qualities that are wont to appear after a\\nclose inspection in the works of those masters whom we hold to be\\nthe best. And that this is true, is demonstrated to us in our own\\nday by experience, from the works of Domenico Puligo, a painter of\\nFlorence; wherein what has been said above may be clearly recognized\\nby one who has knowledge of the matters of art.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile Ridolfo, the son of Domenico Ghirlandajo, was executing a\\nnumber of works in painting at Florence, as will be related, he\\nfollowed his father's habit of always keeping many young men\\npainting in his workshop: which was the reason that not a few of\\nthem, through competing one with another, became very good masters,\\nsome at making portraits from life, some at working in fresco,\\nothers in distemper, and others at painting readily on cloth. Making\\nthese lads execute pictures, panels, and canvases, in the course of\\na few years Ridolfo, with great profit for himself, sent an endless\\nnumber of these to England, to Germany, and to Spain. Baccio Gotti\\nand Toto del Nunziata, disciples of Ridolfo, were summoned, one to\\nFrance by King Francis, and the other to England by the King of that\\ncountry, each of whom invited them after having seen some of their\\nwork. Two other disciples of the same master remained with him,\\nworking under him for many years, because, although they had many\\ninvitations into Spain and Hungary from merchants and others, they\\nwere never induced either by promises or by money to tear themselves\\naway from the delights of their country, in which they had more work\\nto do than they were able to execute. One of these two was Antonio\\ndel Ceraiuolo, a Florentine, who, having been many years with\\nLorenzo di Credi, had learnt from him, above all, to draw so well\\nfrom nature, that with supreme facility he gave his portraits an\\nextraordinary likeness to the life, although otherwise he was no\\ngreat draughtsman. And I have seen some heads portrayed from life by\\nhis hand, which, although they have, for example, the nose crooked,\\none lip small and the other large, and other suchlike deformities,\\nnevertheless resemble the life, through his having well caught the\\nexpression of the subject; whereas, on the other hand, many\\nexcellent masters have made pictures and portraits of absolute\\nperfection with regard to art, but with no resemblance whatever to\\nthose that they are supposed to represent. And to tell the truth, he\\nwho executes portraits must contrive, without thinking of what is\\nlooked for in a perfect figure, to make them like those for whom\\nthey are intended. When portraits are like and also beautiful, then\\nmay they be called rare works, and their authors truly excellent\\ncraftsmen. This Antonio, then, besides many portraits, executed a\\nnumber of panel-pictures in Florence; but for the sake of brevity I\\nwill make mention only of two. One of these, wherein he painted a\\nCrucifixion, with S. Mary Magdalene and S. Francis, is in S. Jacopo\\ntra Fossi, on the Canto degli Alberti; and in the other, which is\\nin the Nunziata, is a S. Michael who is weighing souls.\\n\\nThe other of the two aforesaid disciples was Domenico Puligo, who\\nwas more excellent in draughtsmanship and more pleasing and gracious\\nin colouring than any of the others mentioned above. He, considering\\nthat his method of painting with softness, without overloading his\\nworks with colour or making them hard, but causing the distances to\\nrecede little by little as though veiled with a kind of mist, gave\\nhis pictures both relief and grace, and that although the outlines\\nof the figures that he made were lost in such a way that his errors\\nwere concealed and hidden from view in the dark grounds into which\\nthe figures merged, nevertheless his colouring and the beautiful\\nexpressions of his heads made his works pleasing, always kept to the\\nsame method of working and to the same manner, which caused him to\\nbe held in esteem as long as he lived. But omitting to give an\\naccount of the pictures and portraits that he made while in the\\nworkshop of Ridolfo, some of which were sent abroad and some\\nremained in the city, I shall speak only of those which he painted\\nwhen he was rather the friend and rival of Ridolfo than his\\ndisciple, and of those that he executed when he was so much the\\nfriend of Andrea del Sarto, that nothing was more dear to him than\\nto see that master in his workshop, in order to learn from him,\\nshowing him his works and asking his opinion of them, so as to avoid\\nsuch errors and defects as those men often fall into who do not show\\ntheir work to any other craftsman, but trust so much in their own\\njudgment that they would rather incur the censure of all the world\\nwhen those works are finished, than correct them by means of the\\nsuggestions of loving friends.\\n\\nOne of the first things that Domenico executed was a very beautiful\\npicture of Our Lady for Messer Agnolo della Stufa, who has it in his\\nAbbey of Capalona in the district of Arezzo, and holds it very dear\\nfor the great diligence of its execution and the beauty of its\\ncolouring. He painted another picture of Our Lady, no less beautiful\\nthan that one, for Messer Agnolo Niccolini, now Archbishop of Pisa\\nand a Cardinal, who keeps it in his house on the Canto de' Pazzi in\\nFlorence; and likewise another, of equal size and excellence, which\\nis now in the possession of Filippo dell' Antella, at Florence. In\\nanother, which is about three braccia in height, Domenico made a\\nfull-length Madonna with the Child between her knees, a little S.\\nJohn, and another head; and this picture, which is held to be one of\\nthe best works that he executed, since there is no sweeter colouring\\nto be seen, is at the present day in the possession of Messer\\nFilippo Spini, Treasurer to the most Illustrious Prince of Florence,\\nand a gentleman of magnificent spirit, who takes much delight in\\nworks of painting.\\n\\nAmong other portraits that Domenico made from the life, which are\\nall beautiful and also good likenesses, the most beautiful is the\\none which he painted of Monsignore Messer Piero Carnesecchi, at that\\ntime a marvellously handsome youth, for whom he also made some other\\npictures, all very beautiful and executed with much diligence. In\\nlike manner, he portrayed in a picture the Florentine Barbara, a\\nfamous and most lovely courtesan of that day, much beloved by many\\nno less for her fine culture than for her beauty, and particularly\\nbecause she was an excellent musician and sang divinely. But the\\nbest work that Domenico ever executed was a large picture wherein he\\nmade a life-size Madonna, with some angels and little boys, and a S.\\nBernard who is writing; which picture is now in the hands of\\nGiovanni Gualberto del Giocondo, and of his brother Messer Niccolò,\\na Canon of S. Lorenzo in Florence.\\n\\nThe same master made many other pictures, which are dispersed among\\nthe houses of citizens, and in particular some wherein may be seen a\\nhalf-length figure of Cleopatra, causing an asp to bite her on the\\nbreast, and others wherein is the Roman Lucretia killing herself\\nwith a dagger. There are also some very beautiful portraits from\\nlife and pictures by the same hand at the Porta a Pinti, in the\\nhouse of Giulio Scali, a man whose judgment is as fine in the\\nmatters of our arts as it is in those of every other most noble and\\nmost honourable profession. Domenico executed for Francesco del\\nGiocondo, in a panel for his chapel in the great tribune of the\\nChurch of the Servi at Florence, a S. Francis who is receiving the\\nStigmata; which work is very sweet and soft in colouring, and\\nwrought with much diligence. In the Church of Cestello, round the\\nTabernacle of the Sacrament, he painted two angels in fresco, and on\\nthe panel of a chapel in the same church he made a Madonna with her\\nSon in her arms, S. John the Baptist, S. Bernard, and other saints.\\nAnd since it appeared to the monks of that place that he had\\nacquitted himself very well in those works, they caused him to paint\\nin a cloister of their Abbey of Settimo, without Florence, the\\nVisions of Count Ugo, who built seven abbeys. And no long time\\nafter, Puligo painted, in a shrine at the corner of the Via Mozza da\\nS. Catarina, a Madonna standing, with her Son in her arms marrying\\nS. Catherine, and a figure of S. Peter Martyr. For a Company in the\\ntownship of Anghiari he executed a Deposition from the Cross, which\\nmay be numbered among his best works.\\n\\nBut since it was his profession to attend rather to pictures of Our\\nLady, portraits, and other heads, than to great works, he gave up\\nalmost all his time to such things. Now if he had devoted himself\\nnot so much to the pleasures of the world, as he did, and more to\\nthe labours of art, there is no doubt that he would have made great\\nproficience in painting, and especially as Andrea del Sarto, who was\\nmuch his friend, assisted him on many occasions both with advice and\\nwith drawings; for which reason many of his works reveal a\\ndraughtsmanship as fine as the good and beautiful manner of the\\ncolouring. But the circumstance that Domenico was unwilling to\\nendure much fatigue, and accustomed to labour rather in order to get\\nthrough work and make money than for the sake of fame, prevented him\\nfrom reaching a greater height. And thus, associating with gay\\nspirits and lovers of good cheer, and with musicians and women, he\\ndied at the age of fifty-two, in the year 1527, in the pursuit of a\\nlove-affair, having caught the plague at the house of his mistress.\\n\\nColour was handled by him in so good and harmonious a manner, that\\nit is for that reason, rather than for any other, that he deserves\\npraise. Among his disciples was Domenico Beceri of Florence, who,\\ngiving a high finish to his colouring, executed his works in an\\nexcellent manner.\"]"

       "\"OF JACOPO, CALLED L'INDACO\\n PAINTER\\n Jacopo, called L'Indaco, who was a disciple of Domenico del Ghirlandajo, and who worked in Rome with Pinturicchio, was a passing good master in his day; and although he did not make many works, yet those that he did make are worthy of commendation. Nor is there any need to marvel that only very few works issued from his hands, for the reason that, being a gay and humorous fellow and a lover of good cheer, he harboured but few thoughts and would never work save when he could not help it; and so he used to say that doing nothing else but labour, without taking a little pleasure in the world, was no life for a Christian. He lived in close intimacy with Michelagnolo, for when that craftsman, supremely excellent beyond all who have ever lived, wished to have some recreation after his studies and his continuous labours of body and mind, no one was more pleasing to him for the purpose or more suited to his humour than this man.\\n Jacopo worked for many years in Rome, or, to be more precise, he lived many years in Rome, working very little. By his hand, in that city, is the first chapel on the right hand as one enters the Church of S. Agostino by the door of the façade; on the vaulting of which chapel are the Apostles receiving the Holy Spirit, and on the wall below are two stories of Christ--in one His taking Peter and Andrew from their nets, and in the other the Feast of Simon and the Magdalene, in which there is a ceiling of planks and beams, counterfeited very well. In the panel of the same chapel, which he painted in oil, is a Dead Christ, wrought and executed with much mastery and diligence. In the Trinità at Rome, likewise, there is a little panel by his hand with the Coronation of Our Lady. But what need is there to say more about this man? What more, indeed, is there to say? It is enough that he loved gossiping as much as he always hated working and painting.\\n Now seeing that, as has been said, Michelagnolo used to take pleasure in this man's chattering and in the jokes that he was ever making, he kept him almost always at his table; but one day Jacopo wearied him--as such fellows more often than not do come to weary their friends and patrons with their incessant babbling, so often ill-timed and senseless; babbling, I call it, for reasonable talk it cannot be called, since for the most part there is neither reason nor judgment in such people--and Michelagnolo, who, perchance, had other thoughts in his mind at the time and wished to get rid of him, sent him to buy some figs; and no sooner had Jacopo left the house than Michelagnolo bolted the door behind him, determined not to open to him when he came back. L'Indaco, then, on returning from the market-square, perceived, after having knocked at the door for a time in vain, that Michelagnolo did not intend to open to him; whereupon, flying into a rage, he took the figs and the leaves and spread them all over the threshold of the door. This done, he went his way and for many months refused to speak to Michelagnolo; but at last, becoming reconciled with him, he was more his friend than ever. Finally, having reached the age of sixty-eight, he died in Rome.\\n Not unlike Jacopo was a younger brother of his, whose proper name was Francesco, although he too was afterwards called L'Indaco by way of surname; and he, likewise, was a painter, and more than passing good. He was not unlike Jacopo--I mean, in his unwillingness to work (to say the least), and in his love of talking--but in one respect he surpassed Jacopo, for he was ever speaking evil of everyone and decrying the works of every craftsman. This man, after having wrought certain things in Montepulciano both in painting and in clay, painted a little panel for the Audience Chamber of the Company of the Nunziata in Arezzo, containing an Annunciation, and a God the Father in Heaven surrounded by many angels in the form of children. And in the same city, on the first occasion when Duke Alessandro went there, he made a most beautiful triumphal arch, with many figures in relief, at the gate of the Palazzo de' Signori; and also, in competition with other painters who executed a number of other works for the entry of the said Duke, the scenery for the representation of a play, which was held to be very beautiful. Afterwards, having gone to Rome at the time when the Emperor Charles V was expected there, he made some figures in clay, and a coat of arms in fresco for the Roman people on the Campidoglio, which was much extolled. But the best work that ever issued from the hands of this master, and the most highly praised, was a little study wrought in stucco for the Duchess Margherita of Austria in the Palace of the Medici at Rome--a thing so beautiful and so ornate that there is nothing better to be seen; nor do I believe that it is possible, in a certain sense, to do with silver what L'Indaco did in this work with stucco. From these things it may be judged that if this man had taken pleasure in work and had made use of his intelligence, he would have become excellent.\\n Francesco drew passing well, but Jacopo much better, as may be seen in our book.\""
