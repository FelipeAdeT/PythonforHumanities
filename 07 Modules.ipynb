    "\n",
    "By packaging code into a module, developers save it into a file that can be accessed later or by other people. \n",
    "\n",
    "Modules can be imported into the main module. When you do this, you have access to functions, classes, variables and runnable code designed by others. You can thus use their definitions in your own projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because modules are files, they have to be installed on your system before being imported into your Python session in Jupyter.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you are doing this tutorial online (on Binder), you are using an online environment where all necessary packages have been made available. **You do not need to install anything right now.** If you would like to install modules, we have made instructions available in the \"Installing Python and its Modules\" Lesson at the end of the course.\n",

    "To use a module once it is installed, you must access it in your Jupyter session. This is done with the import command.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you will be using a module within a notebook, you must import it. You will have to do this in every new file and session.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also means that you must run the import cell each time you open the file in a new session.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **import command** is simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import module\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "you can also give a package an alias for when you have to call its name:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "import module as md\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is conventional for some modules such as Pandas (pd) or NumPy (np), common modules for handling data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also import an object from within a module:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from module import object\n",
    "```\n",
    "To import multiple objects, just separate them with a comma.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way you import a module has an effect on how you can call its objects to start using them.\n",
    "\n",
    "if you import the whole module, you will have to specify the name  of the module (or nickname, if you assigned one) as well as that of the object, separated by a period sign:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import module as md\n",
    "myobject = md.object #create our own object of the imported object type\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "if you import the object alone, you can just call the object without specifying the module.\n",
